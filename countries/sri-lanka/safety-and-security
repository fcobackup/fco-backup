Terrorism 
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Sri Lanka
Terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka cannot be ruled out.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals and tourists such as:
hotels
bars, restaurants and night clubs
beaches
tourist sites
places of worship
large public gatherings, including major events, public holidays, religious occasions
Avoid crowded public places. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
The conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories has led to heightened tensions around the world. Terrorist groups such as Al-Qaida and Daesh, have called on their supporters to carry out terrorist attacks in response to the conflict. The conflict could also motivate individuals to carry out attacks.
Terrorist attacks could target Jewish or Muslim communities, or the interests of Israel and its allies. Attacks could also be indiscriminate and occur without warning.
On Easter Sunday in April 2019, more than 250 people, including 8 British nationals, were killed in terrorist attacks against 3 churches and 3 hotels in Sri Lanka: in Colombo, Negombo and in Batticaloa.
Political and economic situation
Protests and demonstrations can happen anywhere across the island at short notice, and can become violent. Security authorities may use water cannons and tear gas to control protesters.
Large-scale protests in 2022 resulted in violence and loss of life. Movement around the island was difficult due to restrictions such as curfews and roadblocks. 
Avoid demonstrations, political protests or large gatherings. Monitor local media and sign up to get email notifications when this advice is updated.
Crime
Protecting yourself and your belongings
There’s been an increase in incidents of low-level opportunistic crime. Store your belongings as safely as possible to avoid thefts from hotels and guesthouses. Minimise the number of personal items you carry with you. 
On the street, criminals may ride past on mopeds or motorbikes and try to snatch your bag. Take care of your passport and money by keeping them in a body-belt. Carry bags on the side of you that is furthest from the road and do not place bags in the front basket of bicycles.
Violent crimes against foreigners are rare. Gun crime is not uncommon, but usually it is due to a dispute between different criminal groups.
Bank card fraud
Bank card fraud is common.
Fraudsters can steal your card details without you noticing. Use ATMs inside banks or hotels if possible, and check ATMs on the street for signs of tampering. Keep cards in sight when paying in shops and restaurants. Read more about how to avoid bank card fraud.
Drink spiking
Be alert to the possible use of ‘date rape’ and other drugs including GHB.
Do not take drinks from strangers or leave your drinks unattended. Victims of spiked drinks have been robbed and sometimes assaulted. Alcohol and drugs can reduce your vigilance, making you less in control. If you drink, know your limit. Drinks served in Sri Lanka are often stronger than in the UK as bars and hotels rarely use measures.
Sexual assault
Women continue to report incidents of verbal and physical harassment by men, ranging from sexually suggestive or lewd comments to physical advances and sexual assaults.
Incidents can happen anywhere, but the majority of reported cases take place in crowded areas including:
markets
bus and railway stations, or on buses
sporting events
tourist sites
Take care when travelling alone or in small groups and consider carrying a personal alarm.
Laws and cultural differences 
Personal ID
You must always carry your passport as an official form of identification. A copy is usually acceptable, but in some situations you may have to produce the original at a police station within a specified time limit.
Alcohol laws and bans
Police could fine you if you ignore notices prohibiting alcohol in certain public areas.
Alcohol is not usually available on religious holidays. Drinking in public on these days could be culturally insensitive. Check locally for dates of religious holidays when this applies.
Smoking and e-cigarette bans
Police could fine you if you ignore ‘no smoking’ signs in certain public areas.
Illegal drugs
Illegal drugs, including cannabis, carry severe penalties. You should expect a long jail sentence and heavy fines for possessing, using or smuggling illegal drugs, including when transiting through the airport.
Airports in Sri Lanka use technology to detect illegal items. This is also used to scan the baggage of transiting passengers.
Detention and prison sentences
There are severe penalties for drug offences, terrorism and all other serious crimes. The authorities could hold you without charge indefinitely. If convicted, you may face a lengthy prison sentence.
If you’re arrested under Sri Lanka’s Prevention of Terrorism Act, the authorities could detain you without charge awaiting a trial date. 
Using cameras, binoculars and drones in secure areas
Do not fly drones near, use binoculars to look at, or take photographs of:
military bases
government buildings
vehicles used by VIPs
Check how to register and operate drones with Sri Lanka’s Civil Aviation Authority.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual activity is illegal, but we are not aware of any prosecutions.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Dress codes
Nude or topless sunbathing is not allowed.
If you enter a Buddhist temple:
cover your legs and shoulders
take off shoes and hats
Religion
Disrespecting Buddhist images and artefacts, or making offensive remarks about religion, is a serious offence and can lead to arrest. If you have visible tattoos of Buddha, you can be refused entry to Sri Lanka or face deportation. Do not pose for photographs standing in front of a statue of Buddha.      
Wildlife
Some Sri Lankan animals can be dangerous. If in doubt, follow advice from authorised guides or your travel operator. Wild elephants and crocodiles will attack humans on occasion. Venomous insects and snakes are found in many parts of the country – though not common in populated areas.
Feral dogs are common and sometimes carry rabies.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism 
Swimming safety
Many beaches in Sri Lanka have dangerous surf or rip tides at certain times of the year. Get advice from your hotel or tour operator before going in the sea.
See water safety on holiday from the Royal Life Saving Society.
Transport risks 
Road travel 
If you are planning to drive in Sri Lanka, see information on driving abroad. Tourists can hire cars, tuk tuks and motorbikes to drive. If you hire a vehicle, check that the company you rent the vehicle from is registered with the Sri Lanka Tourist Board and has a ‘Safe & Secure’ certificate. You should also:
have appropriate insurance
ensure that the vehicle is roadworthy before you start your journey
You need a 1949 international driving permit (IDP) and a Sri Lankan ‘recognition permit’ to drive a hire vehicle.
You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. Take your UK driving licence and your IDP along with 2 passport photos to:
Automobile Association of Ceylon
40 Sir Mohomad Macan Markar Mawatha
Colombo 00300
They will verify your documents and issue a recognition permit. Your hire car company will usually help with this.
Road safety
Some roads, particularly in more remote areas, may be in poor condition. Driving is erratic and there are frequent road accidents, particularly at night. Stay alert for pedestrians and animals on busy roads. Riding a motorbike can be especially dangerous.
If you have a collision, stay at the site of the accident with your vehicle as long as it is safe to do so. If it is not safe or if you feel threatened, report to a local police station.
There are still security checkpoints on main roads in parts of the country. Follow the instructions of the police or army officers on duty. Security forces have opened fire on vehicles that have not stopped when asked. Roads around government and military sites in Colombo are often closed for security reasons, such as access for VIP convoys.
Buses
Public buses are often driven fast, rarely give way and are often poorly maintained leading to serious bus accidents in recent years. Tourist buses are usually driven more professionally and safely, but standards can vary.
Taxis
You can book taxis using local and international taxi apps. There is less availability outside tourist areas. Motorised rickshaws (‘tuk-tuks’) are available for hire in towns and villages. Agree a price before you set off or look for one with a working meter.
There are occasional reports of harassment, particularly of women travellers at night. Change to a different tuk-tuk or taxi if you have any concerns about the driver or their standard of driving.
Rail travel
When travelling by train, make sure you stay within the train carriage while the train is moving. There have been fatal accidents when visitors have hung out of open doorways or windows of trains. Take care of your personal possessions at all times. There have been incidents of theft and pickpocketing.
Sea travel
You need prior permission to enter Sri Lankan waters and the security zones in coastal areas.
The threat of piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces is that all sailing yachts under their own passage should stay out of the designated High Risk Area or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.

Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Monsoon
Monsoon rains can cause flooding in many places in Sri Lanka. Floods can cause widespread displacement of people, injuries and occasional deaths. Heavy rains and landslips can also lead to road closures and affect local transport links.
Monitor Sri Lanka’s Disaster Management Centre and the Sri Lankan Department of Meteorology for updates and follow local advice.
Tropical cyclones
There is a risk of tropical cyclones. Monitor Sri Lanka’s Disaster Management Centre and the World Meteorological Organization for updates.
