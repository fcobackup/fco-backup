The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Finnish borders remain closed to all non-resident foreign nationals entering the country, with some exemptions. From 15 June, internal border controls have been lifted for travel between Finland and Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Visit the Finnish Border Guard website for more information. British residents should display an ID card or other proof of residence when arriving in Finland. Upon arrival in Finland, you must avoid unnecessary close contact with others and self-isolate for a period of 14 days. During self-isolation, you are permitted to move between your workplace and place of residence. Engaging in other essential activities is also permitted.
There are no Finnish restrictions on cross-border traffic with other states in the Schengen area for commuter and other essential traffic. Restrictions for other travellers remain in place. See the Finnish Border Guard website for more information.
Non-resident British nationals are permitted to enter Finland for limited essential or compassionate reasons with evidence for their travel. See the Finnish Border Guard website for more information. Passengers are allowed to transit through Helsinki Airport as long as they can verify acceptance at their final destination. Finavia strongly recommend that passengers use facemasks as they travel round airports in Finland, and Finnair have made the wearing of facemasks mandatory for passengers aged seven or over on their flights. Please check your carrier’s requirements before travelling.
