State of Emergency declared
On 8 January 2024, the President declared a 60-day state of emergency (SOE) following various prison riots and the escape of gang leaders, foreseeing increased crime activity nationwide. This new SOE includes a daily curfew from 11pm to 5am. Exceptions to the curfew include passengers travelling to/from airports who will need to show their passports or ID and their relevant boarding pass or flight booking.
Following the SOE announcement, various incidents have escalated throughout the country. There have been reports of a series of explosions, shooting, vehicles set on fire and the abduction of police officials and prison security guards.
If an incident occurs near you, follow the instructions of police and other security officials at all times.
