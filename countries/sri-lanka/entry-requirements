This page has information on travelling to Sri Lanka.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Sri Lanka set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Sri Lanka’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
All visitors are advised to apply online for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) to enter Sri Lanka. Visitors can apply for an ETA on the ETA website. Further information on eligibility is available on the Department of Immigration and Emigration website.
On arrival visa facilities are available, however applying for an ETA before travel is advised for ease of travel and to prevent delays on arrival.
All visitors need to comply with the guidelines imposed for tourists by the Government of Sri Lanka.
If your visa is expiring you will need to apply for an extension through the Department for Immigration and Emigration. You should ring the Department for Immigration and Emigration on +94 70 710 1050 or visit their website to make an appointment.
Entry requirements could change at short notice, and government websites are not always up to date. You should follow the instructions of the local authorities.
