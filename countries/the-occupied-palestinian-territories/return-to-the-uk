There are still some commercial options to return to the UK from Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Do not risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories because commercial routes are operating.
If you cannot leave Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus;
find accommodation that is suitable for your needs; and
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
If you require urgent support, please contact the British Embassy in Tel Aviv or the British Consulate General in Jerusalem.
See additional advice on making travel plans to return to the UK, or what to do if you cannot depart immediately.

Travel via third countries
Some airlines are still operating international flights from Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport. Israir Airlines continues to operate a number of one-off flights to European destinations.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
