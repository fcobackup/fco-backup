This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Kyrgyzstan set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry to Kyrgyzstan
A negative PCR test or proof of vaccination status are not required for entry to Kyrgyzstan. However, requirements could change at short notice. Check with your airline before travel. For any questions on entry or exit requirements you should contact the Kyrgyz border force on +996 312 881 618.

Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Passengers may have their temperature tested on arrival. If you’re showing symptoms of Coronavirus you may be taken to state medical facilities and could be asked to self-isolate at home.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Kyrgyzstan operates a 60 day visa free regime for British nationals.
From 1 March 2022 the Kyrgyz Government stopped operating a “green corridor” whereby penalties were waived for foreign citizens who had overstayed the visa free period, even if registration had expired.
Visas for Kyrgyzstan are issued electronically through the portal “e-visa”. If you need further information about entry requirements or visa issues, visit the MFA visa website or contact the local immigration authorities.
You can contact the Kyrgyz visa service at e-visa@mfa.gov.kg or +996 312 66 30 70 and +996 703 42 88 65 (WhatsApp).
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Kyrgyzstan and must have at least 1 full blank page if you’re applying for a visa. This rule is not applicable when entering Kyrgyzstan under the 60 day visa-free regime.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Kyrgyzstan. If using one to leave Kyrgyzstan, you must obtain an exit visa from OVIR (the Department for Visa and Registration under the Ministry of Internal Affairs). This takes at least 5 working days.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Registration
On 19 December 2016, the government of Kyrgyzstan approved a decree removing the requirement for British nationals staying in Kyrgyzstan for longer than 5 days to register with the local authorities. You now only need to register your stay with the State Registration Service if you’re visiting for more than 60 calendar days. If you’re staying for more than 60 calendar days you must register within 5 days of entry into Kyrgyzstan and you must register for the period of validity of your visa.
Foreigners can now register through the electronic services portal (available in Russian and Kyrgyz only). Foreign citizens can act as a host and register visitors staying in their homes. The registration coupon with QR-code on the forms can be obtained online and printed on a regular printer.
