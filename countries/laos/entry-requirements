This page has information on travelling to Laos. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Laos set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
The government of the Lao PDR has suspended the visa on arrival service at all international entry points. No visas are being issued to people travelling from a country with cases of COVID-19, including the UK. However, the Lao authorities may consider granting special entry permission for foreigners (e.g. experts, technicians and foreign nationals that are needed for essential projects) who wish to come to Laos.
Entry procedures for Laos visa-holders:
all foreigners must present a Certificate of Entry (issued by the MFA); a completed Health Declaration form; and a ‘Fit to Fly’ Certificate issued no more than 72 hours prior to travel. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test
all arrivals will be subject to a COVID-19 test at their own expense. Positive cases will be admitted to hospital for treatment
all negative cases have to undergo 14 days quarantine at designated locations (with all expenses covered by individuals or their organisations/companies)
The application form for the health declaration is available on the official website for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Due to the impacts of coronavirus the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to extend visas in country and be flexible if visas cannot be extended before the due date for operational reasons because of the new regulations.
Screening on arrival
There is compulsory testing for COVID-19 on arrival in Laos at your own expense. Those testing positive will be admitted to hospital for treatment.
Enhanced health screening is in place at border crossings between Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam where restricted access is allowed. You should allow additional time to include this possibility and check with your airline if travelling by air.
Anybody travelling to Laos with a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, and a travel history from coronavirus affected countries, will be isolated in hospital and tested. The hospitals being used are Mittaphab, Maho-sot, Setthathirath and the National Military Hospital (103).
Quarantine requirements
All arrivals testing negative for COVID-19 will have to undergo 14 days quarantine at designated locations, which include hotels (with all expenses covered by individuals or their organisations/companies). A mandatory tracking device is fitted on arrival (a rental fee applies) to be worn during quarantine.
All travellers must have insurance covering COVID-19; a suitable policy is available for purchase on arrival.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Laos are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
Proof of vaccination status
Laos will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
You do not need proof of vaccination to enter Laos.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Laos are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
You can use the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery record to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when entering Laos.
Requirements are still the same regardless if you have had COVID-19 in the past year.
Children and young people
Requirements are the same regardless of age. See the ‘All travellers’ section.
If you’re transiting through Laos
There are currently no transit options via Laos.
Exemptions
Exemptions to Laos’ entry requirements may apply for:
Close family members of seriously or terminally ill patients
People attending the funeral of a close family member
Parents visiting any children who are minors
Travellers must contact your nearest Lao Embassy before entering Laos.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of entry into Laos.
Additionally, be aware that a number of airlines will now only allow boarding of flights to Laos if you have two blank pages in your passport.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Laos. If you’re planning to enter Laos using a UK ETD you should contact the nearest Lao embassy or consulate to get the appropriate visa before you travel.
If your passport has been lost or stolen, you must report the loss or theft to the nearest police station and get a police report. You’ll then need to get a certificate of loss from the Immigration Department in Vientiane which usually takes 1 to 2 working days.
After getting an ETD from the British Embassy, you’ll need to get an exit visa from the Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs which takes up to 3 days.
