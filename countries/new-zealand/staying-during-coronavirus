Moving around in New Zealand
For information on entering or transiting through New Zealand, see Entry requirements
The New Zealand Government has introduced a four-level national COVID-19 alert system. At 2359 local time on Monday 8 June 2020, New Zealand moved to Alert Level 1 meaning people can gather and return to work, school, sports and domestic travel without restriction. New Zealand’s border restrictions remain in place and public health measures remain unchanged (wash hands and high-touch surfaces regularly, stay home if sick, and get tested if symptomatic).
Full details on the New Zealand Government’s coronavirus national response alert system and the requirements for each level can be found on the New Zealand Government COVID-19 website.
The State of National Emergency has now been lifted.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in New Zealand and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This is a last resort option for those most in need and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
