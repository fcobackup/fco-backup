This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Costa Rica’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Costa Rica set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Costa Rican Embassy in the UK. 
COVID-19 rules 
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Costa Rica. 
Passport validity requirements  
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 1 day after the day you plan to leave Costa Rica. 
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements 
British nationals do not need a visa to enter Costa Rica. You may stay as a visitor for up to 180 days under a tourist visa waiver, although the exact period is at the discretion of the immigration officer on arrival.
If you plan to work, or stay for a longer period, you should check the requirements with the Costa Rican Embassy in the UK.    
If you overstay, the immigration authorities can fine you 100 US dollars for each month and refuse future applications to enter Costa Rica.
Airport tax 
When leaving the country by air, you may need to pay a departure tax of 29 US dollars. Most airlines include this in ticket prices. If you need to pay it, you can use cash or card. 
Vaccine requirements  
To enter Costa Rica, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Costa Rica guide.
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Costa Rica. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.  
Taking money into Costa Rica  
Declare cash, travellers cheques or goods if the value is 10,000 US dollars or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. If you do not, your money or goods could be seized when you leave.
