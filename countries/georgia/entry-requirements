Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Georgia.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Georgia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Georgia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of Georgia in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Georgia.
You might be asked to wear masks in hospitals.
Passport validity requirements
If you’re visiting Georgia, your passport should be valid for the length of your visit.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
British nationals do not need a visa to visit Georgia for up to one year. To stay longer or to travel for work or study, you must apply for a longer-term visa. Contact the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for more information.
If you’re in Georgia for more than 183 days and do any paid employment, you’re automatically liable for income tax and must tell the Revenue Service of Georgia. This applies whether you are on a visitor’s permit or officially resident. You’ll be fined if you do not comply.
Travel insurance
All visitors to Georgia must have adequate travel insurance to cover all healthcare needs during their visit. You may be asked for evidence of this, either by your airline at check-in or by immigration authorities when you arrive in Georgia. You may face difficulties if you do not have this evidence.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Travelling with medicines
Georgia has a very strict anti-drugs policy. This can also cover prescription and non-prescription medicines commonly available in the UK. For example, non-prescription medicines containing codeine are illegal.
This can cause serious problems for travellers and in some cases lead to prosecution. Foreign nationals have been detained on arrival for having medicines that would not normally cause problems in the UK.
For more information on the legal status of a specific medicine, contact the Revenue Service of Georgia or the Embassy of Georgia in the UK.
If you plan to travel with prescription medicine, you must carry a doctor’s prescription and ideally the original packaging.
