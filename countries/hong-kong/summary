In recent weeks several large-scale political demonstrations have taken place in the Admiralty and Wan Chai areas on Hong Kong Island, and at the High Speed Rail Terminus in Kowloon, resulting in road closures and disruption to public transport. Violent clashes have also taken place between police and protesters. Further demonstrations remain likely. These may take place throughout Hong Kong, including the New Territories and Kowloon with little or no notice. Sections of the city may be closed off and public transport affected. The situation remains unpredictable, so you should remain vigilant and keep up to date with developments. If you’re in and around areas where demonstrations are taking place, you should follow the advice of local authorities and move away quickly to a safe place if there are signs of disorder.
