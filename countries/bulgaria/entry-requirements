This page has information on travelling to Bulgaria. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Bulgaria set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
All travellers should follow the entry rules set out for their COVID-19 status.
Bulgaria COVID-19 classification system
The colour-zone system for international travel was lifted on 1 April 2022. The following requirements for entry remain in force:
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Bulgaria from UK without needing to test or quarantine as long as your documentation shows the following:
At least 14 days must have passed since the last dose of your main vaccination schedule was administered
If the last dose of your main vaccination schedule was more than 270 days ago, you will also need to show evidence of a follow-up booster dose
These requirements apply to all travellers aged 12 and above.
Proof of vaccination status
Bulgaria will accept the UK’s NHS vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 recovery and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you do not have access to the UK COVID Pass app or the EU Digital COVID Certificate, you can present a document containing:
your name in English,
date of birth,
date of the last administered dose,
serial number of the dose,
the total number of doses administered,
trade name of vaccine,
batch number of dose(s),
manufacturer name,
name of country and
the organisation who has issued the certificate
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you can enter from the UK with a negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours before entry) or rapid lateral flow test (taken no more than 48 hours before entry). See information on getting a test before entry
The above document must contain:
your name in English,
date of birth,
date of the PCR or antigen test,
details of the medical institution that performed the test (name, address or other contact details),
the authority that issued the document,
the country in which the test has been performed, and
the result (Negative) written in English and, for EU certificates, its unique identifier
This requirement applies to all travellers aged 12 and above.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last year, you can enter Bulgaria. You’ll need to show evidence of prior COVID infection by showing a positive result from a PCR or rapid antigen test which must be dated at least 11, but no more than 180 days before arrival.
The above document must contain:
your name in English,
date of birth,
date of the PCR or antigen test,
details of the medical institution that performed the test (name, address or other contact details),
the authority that issued the document,
the country in which the test has been performed, and
the result (Positive) written in English and, for EU certificates, its unique identifier
You can also use the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery record to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when entering Bulgaria.
Children and young people
Children aged 11 and under are exempt from quarantine and the requirement to present COVID-19 documents upon their arrival in Bulgaria.
If you’re transiting through Bulgaria
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
No COVID documents are required for those transiting Bulgaria when the ‘immediate departure’ from the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria can be demonstrated.
Exemptions
Arrivals in Bulgaria can enter the country without any of the above listed documents, but they must self-isolate for 10 days. This 10-day quarantine period can be shortened if they perform a PCR or rapid antigen test no earlier than 72 hours after their arrival in Bulgaria. If the result is negative, the quarantine will be revoked from the day of the registration of the result.
A list of places offering PCR testing in Bulgaria is available here in Bulgarian. You should submit the document showing a negative result of the PCR test to the respective Regional Health Inspectorate.
The measures are in force at all air, road, rail and sea border crossings into Bulgaria.
People who can enter Bulgaria without the need to submit documents for COVID-19 include: bus and lorry drivers, crews of vessels and aircraft, border workers and those transiting through the country.
Further information on the full range of exemptions is available on the following Bulgarian Government website (in Bulgarian). If you fall into one of the exempted categories, you should contact your travel operator in advance of travel for further information on how to demonstrate your exemption.
Neighbouring countries are implementing additional health requirements for entry to or departure from Bulgaria including declarations and COVID-19 tests. You should check the relevant FCDO Travel Advice.
If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before you travel.
HGV drivers
HGV drivers from the UK entering Bulgaria do not have to show a negative COVID-19 test, proof of vaccination or proof of recovery and do not have to quarantine.
Check your passport and travel documents before your travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
Bulgaria is not part of the Schengen area, Visits to Bulgaria do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area.
Visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in Bulgaria.
You can travel to Bulgaria for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit for family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Bulgarian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Bulgarian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Bulgaria for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Bulgaria with a Bulgarian residence permit or long-stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for Bulgaria.
Passport stamping
As a visitor, your passport may be stamped when you enter and exit Bulgaria. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in Bulgaria.
If you enter or exit the Schengen area through Bulgaria as a visitor, check that your passport is stamped. This will show border guards that you are complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for Bulgaria and the separate 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.
If the relevant entry or exit stamp is not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit. If you show evidence eg transport tickets to prove when you entered or exited Bulgaria, border guards should add this entry or exit date and the location in your passport.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you have a Withdrawal Agreement residency document for another country, your passport might still be stamped if you are a visitor to Bulgaria.
If you are resident in Bulgaria, read our Living in Bulgaria guide for passport stamping information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Bulgaria.
