The rainy season runs from November until March in the south and south east (including in Rio de Janeiro) and from April until July in the north east of the country. Heavy rains can often disrupt infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. Flash floods and landslides, especially in poorer urban areas, are common during heavy rains. Monitor local media and follow any instructions given by the local authorities.
As a result of extreme flooding and landslides a state of calamity has been declared in the northern coastal areas of São Paulo state in the towns of São Sabastião, Ilhabela, Ubatuba, Guarujá, Caraguatatuba and Bertioga. Extreme caution is advised if travelling to these or other locations on the São Paulo coast, with heavy rain forecast to continue. Check local media and weather advice.
Heavy rainfall in Rio de Janeiro (particularly in the summer months of January - March) can lead to landslides and localised flash floods including in tourist areas due to the proximity of the mountains to the coast. Be alert to local authority warnings which are displayed on digital signs in the street and sent to hotels and hostels. Avoid travelling on the road during heavy rain and instead wait for the rain to pass. Cars and buses have been caught in landslides resulting in deaths. If you are outside when the rain starts, avoid walking in flooded areas, and in particular do not cross fast flowing water, however shallow you think it is. People have been drowned when swept away.
