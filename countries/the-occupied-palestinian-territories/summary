This travel advice covers Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to:
Gaza
the Sheba’a Farms and Ghajjar and within 500m of the border with Lebanon (the ‘Blue Line’) east of Metula, including the northern edge of the town
east of Route 98 along the Syrian border.
The security situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories can be fast moving, tense and unpredictable. You should be vigilant at all times and keep up to date with local media and travel reports.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including places frequented by foreigners, and on public transport. See Terrorism.
There have been repeated instances of rocket fire from Gaza; Israel has often responded by returning projectile fire into Gaza. On 14 March 2019, a number of projectiles were fired from Gaza towards central Israel. Rocket sirens were sounded and Israeli air defences launched. Israel responded overnight on 14/15 March by targeting around 100 suspected Hamas positions in Gaza. If travelling in central or southern Israel, familiarise yourself with the safety actions that you should take in the event of a warning siren, follow advice from local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and this travel advice.
There have been mass protests on the Gazan side of the Gaza/Israel perimeter fence on a regular basis since March 2018. These protests may continue for some time. There is a risk of increased tension at checkpoints in Gaza during this period. You should avoid demonstrations, follow instructions of local authorities and keep up to date with local media and travel reports.
There are significant tensions between Israel, and the Assad regime and Iranian military forces in Syria. On 21 January 2019, the Israeli Air Force stated that it had struck Iranian military assets in Syria, in response to missile fire towards the Israeli-occupied Golan. The situation remains fragile, and could change quickly. If travelling in the area remain vigilant, follow advice from local authorities and stay informed of the security situation through the media and FCO travel advice. The FCO advises against all travel east of Route 98 along the Syrian border.
There are continued heightened tensions between Israel and Lebanon. From December 2018 to January 2019, Israel carried out an operation to destroy “Hizballah underground tunnels” which cross the Blue Line from Lebanon into Israel. Israel has also been constructing a security barrier along the Blue Line, with some sections in disputed territory. The situation on the ground could change quickly. As above, the FCO advises against travel to the Sheba’a Farms and Ghajjar and within 500m of the border with Lebanon (the ‘Blue Line’) east of Metula, including the northern edge of the town. Also if travelling near areas of military operation, adhere to all Israeli official instructions.
Make sure you are aware of Israeli immigration policies before you travel. Allow extra time for increased security measures and checks at airports during Israeli holidays and during the peak summer tourist season. See Entry Requirements.
The Israeli Parliament passed a law on 6 March 2017, which gives authority to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott. Contact the Israeli embassy for further information. See Entry Requirements.
In Israel and the West Bank, including Tel Aviv, East Jerusalem and the Old City (particularly the Damascus Gate and Lion’s Gate areas of the Old City) and Hebron, there have been numerous violent clashes between protestors and security forces and stabbing, shooting, arson, vehicle ramming and stone throwing attacks on people and vehicles. These types of incidents also happen along Route 60 within the West Bank (the main road connecting Jerusalem with Nablus and Hebron) and along Route 443 between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. There’s a risk that tourists or bystanders could be caught up in any incident. You should avoid any demonstrations and follow instructions of local authorities.
Be especially vigilant and take great care at the Qalandiya checkpoint between East Jerusalem and Ramallah, in areas close to refugee camps, in and around Israeli settlements and in the cities of Jenin, Nablus and Ramallah.There have also been several violent incidents in the northern West Bank area (north of Tappuah). Individuals carrying weapons have been arrested in Nablus.
There is a risk of increased tension around Jewish high holidays (Passover, Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur and Succoth) and after Friday prayers and on religious holidays. Demonstrations and other forms of civil unrest can occur at short notice and often turn violent. See Safety and security
There have been a number of violent incidents on public transport and near public transport lines in Jerusalem, including the Light Rail network. You should avoid using buses in Jerusalem.
Due to a significant number of road traffic accidents involving taxis in the West Bank we advise you to avoid using them where possible.
Take extra care when using public transport in Tel Aviv, in particular at transport hubs, and when using buses in the greater Tel Aviv area. You may wish to consider using other forms of transport.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Occupied Golan Heights where we advise against all travel.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
