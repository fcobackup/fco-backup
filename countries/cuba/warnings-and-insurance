Tropical Storm Rafael
Tropical Storm Rafael is expected to make landfall in Western Cuba as a Category 1 or Category 2 hurricane on 6 November. There is risk of heavy rain, flash flooding and land slides. This could also affect the ongoing power outages. You should monitor local media for updates, and take precautions including conserving water, food and mobile phone charge.
The Cuban authorities have announced the closure of the airports of Havana, Varadero, Gerona and Cayo Largo del Sur from 12:00 midnight (local time) on Tuesday 5 November until 12:00 noon (local time) on Thursday 7 November. This is due to the passage of hurricane Rafael through Western Cuba.
You should contact your airline or tour operator to reschedule your flight. Airlines have been informed.
