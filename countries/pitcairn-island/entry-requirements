This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Pitcairn Island’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities on Pitcairn Island set and enforce entry rules. This includes all visitors and potential new settlers to have comprehensive travel insurance, including medical evacuation cover. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, visit the Pitcairn Islands government website.
The Pitcairn Islands group is made up of the islands of Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno. Pitcairn is the only inhabited island. There is no airport on the islands. Most travel to Pitcairn is via a Government of Pitcairn Islands-chartered supply ship, which regularly operates between Mangareva in French Polynesia and Pitcairn Island (about 300km away).
