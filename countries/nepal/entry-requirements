This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Nepal set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Nepal
When flying to Nepal, you will need to present certain documentation:
a certificate showing a negative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, taken within 72 hours of flight of first departure or a complete vaccination against COVID-19. (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’)
a visa or prior approval document (unless certified vaccinated, in which case you can secure a visa on arrival)
a hotel booking that allows at least ten days’ quarantine in Nepal (if not vaccinated)
a travel insurance document which covers health, immediate crisis, or rescue for the duration of your travel
a barcode generated from the online application of the Online International Travel Arrival Form. See ARMS-DIMS
The Department of Immigration has fuller information.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Nepal will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You should be able to get a visa on arrival if you can prove your vaccination status.
People who have completed COVID-19 vaccination at least 14 days prior to entry to Nepal can now get visas on arrival (you should bring proof of vaccination). Non-vaccinated people cannot get visas on arrival, and are advised to contact their nearest Embassy of Nepal before departure for Nepal. You should refer to this notice regarding visa services.
Passport validity
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months when you submit your application for a visa.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Nepal with a valid visa.
If you’re issued with an ETD in Nepal to use to exit Nepal, you will need to get an exit visa stamp from the Department of Immigration Office in Kathmandu.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Medication
If you’re planning to take medication into Nepal, you should bring the prescription with you. For further details contact the Embassy of Nepal.
