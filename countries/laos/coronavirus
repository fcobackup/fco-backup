Entry and borders
Visa on arrival and eVisa services at all international entry points have been suspended for all foreign nationals by the Lao Government.
Border crossings remain closed, however the use of the Lao-Thai Friendship Bridge for non-COVID 19 related medical emergencies is permitted by ambulance. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will facilitate the return of foreigners to their home country who wish to do so, including extending visas as necessary.
Health screening
Enhanced health screening is in place and border crossings between Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam are closed. You should allow additional time to include this possibility and check with your airline if travelling by air.
Anybody travelling to Laos with a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, and a travel history from coronavirus affected countries, will be isolated in hospital and tested. The hospitals being used are Mittaphab, Mahosot, Setthathirath and the National Military Hospital (103).
There is a temporary suspension of all visas for foreign nationals travelling from countries with cases of infection. Exceptions can be made for experts, technicians and foreign nationals that are required for essential projects. They will have to undergo a COVID-19 test and perform self-quarantine for 14 days in government approved facilities.

Local measures
As from Monday 4 May, the Lao Government has eased some of the ‘lockdown’ measures that were previously in place.
Some cafes, markets, restaurants, shopping centres and offices may open, but entertainment venues such as gyms and large gatherings will remain closed for now. All people residing in Laos must continue to practice physical distancing, including while exercising, and remember to wear masks and regularly wash hands.
Supermarkets, pharmacies and shops selling foodstuffs remain open.
Bars and clubs, and educational institutions are closed.
Travel between provinces remains controlled except for essential purposes. Public transport (including domestic flights and buses) remain suspended.
Further measures may be introduced at short notice. You should follow the advice of the Lao authorities.
Visas
The Department of Immigration reopened on 4 May and foreigners are required to maintain valid visas for the period of their stay in Laos. If your visa expired during the lockdown period, you will be required to pay the regular fee for any days without a visa since 9 April in addition to the cost of any extension. Immigration departments will re-impose overstay fines after Friday 8 May.
