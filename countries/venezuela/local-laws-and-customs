Do not handle illegal drugs. Drug trafficking is considered a serious crime in Venezuela. Detection methods are sophisticated and drug traffickers should expect to be arrested. Conviction leads to severe penalties, including up to 2 years on remand before sentencing and then a lengthy prison sentence of between 8 and 12 years. Conditions in Venezuelan jails are harsh and dangerous, and among the worst in the region.
It is an offence to photograph military or strategic installations including military airports and the Presidential Palace. Avoid plane spotting.
