Flights
The final British Embassy-organised flights to the UK departed on 2 May.
Ferries
Ferry tickets are on sale for British tourists in campervans to travel from Tangier to Sete, France on 12 and 19 May. To purchase tickets please go to the GNV Website. Once confirmed, please email your booking details to the British Embassy in Rabat to arrange the necessary authorisations so that you can drive to the port from your current location.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, please email the British Embassy in Rabat at morocco.britishsupport@fco.gov.uk.
Passenger ferry links between Morocco and Spain and Gibraltar have also been suspended.
Follow the British Embassy Rabat on Twitter and Facebook for the latest available information.
