This page has information on travelling to Kuwait.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Kuwait set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Kuwait’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Kuwait.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Visas
British Nationals have the option of either applying for an E-visa prior to travel or obtaining a visa on arrival in Kuwait. Visit the Ministry of Interior website for more information on E-visas. On arrival in Kuwait, the immigration authorities may ask to see evidence of return or onward travel, a sponsor’s letter and hotel confirmation. For further information, contact the Embassy of Kuwait, 2 Albert Gate, London, SW1X 7JU (telephone 020 7590 3400).
Passport validity
For visit visas, obtained on arrival or in advance, your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Kuwait.
For residency visas, your passport should be valid for a minimum of 2 years.
Previous travel to Israel
If you have an Israeli stamp in your passport, you may be refused a visa and/or entry into Kuwait.
Living and working in Kuwait
For work or residency visas, apply to the Kuwaiti Embassy in London.
If you intend to use UK documents like academic records, marriage certificates, or your driving licence in your application, you should have all such documents authenticated by the FCDO in the UK or by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country in which they were awarded and the nearest Kuwaiti Embassy. The same procedure is necessary for children’s birth certificates.
Your employers should not retain your passport.
Unpaid fines and bills
From 1 September 2023, it is mandatory for all non-Kuwaitis to settle any traffic fines and unpaid utility bills before leaving Kuwait. From 6 September 2023, it is also mandatory for non-Kuwaitis to settle any unpaid telecommunications bills prior to departing the country.
