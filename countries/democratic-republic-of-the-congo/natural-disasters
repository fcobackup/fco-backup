Volcanoes
The Nyiragongo volcano in Virunga National Park is active and has only limited access to tourists.
On 22 May 2021, Mount Nyiragongo volcano, close to the city of Goma, and near the border with Rwanda erupted. Volcanic activity is possible at any time.
British nationals who are concerned should contact the British Embassy in Kinshasa online or by telephone on +243 81 556 6200. The UK Government Office in Goma is open.
The previous eruptions of Mount Nyiragongo in 2021 and 2002 resulted in loss of lives and some infrastructure in and around Goma. Local authorities, the UN and local NGOs continue to monitor the volcanoâ€™s activity.
