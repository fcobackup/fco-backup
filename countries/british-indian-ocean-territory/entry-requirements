Permits
Access to the British Indian Ocean Territory is restricted and a permit is required in advance of travel. There are no commercial flights and permits for yachts are only issued to allow safe passage through the Indian Ocean (outer islands only). Access to Diego Garcia is only permitted to those with connections either to the military facility or to the Territory’s Administration.
Mooring permits for the British Indian Ocean Territory (outer islands) for yachts transiting through the Indian Ocean must be applied for at least 6 weeks in advance from the British Indian Ocean Territory Administration, Foreign & Commonwealth Office, King Charles Street, London SW1A 2AH.

There are no medical facilities in the Territory. Search and rescue facilities are extremely limited. You’ll need proof of comprehensive travel insurance (to include medical evacuation for a minimum of $100,000 US per person on board) and yacht insurance (to include wreck recovery, clean up and disposal) before a permit can be issued.
The Territory’s website has useful information for visit permit request forms and further guidance.
Passport validity
