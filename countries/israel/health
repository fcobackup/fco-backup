At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, but cases have been confirmed in other countries, including Israel. The Israeli authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures.
The Israeli Ministry of Health, and the Population and Immigration and Border Control is currently prohibiting entry for non-resident visitors who had been staying in China, Thailand, Macao, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Japan in the last 14 days prior to their arrival. The Ministry of Health is also mandating a 14-day home quarantine of all travellers who have visited mainland China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Macao, South Korea, Japan or Italy. This includes restrictions on travelers with connecting flights in mainland China or South Korea. Anyone that has had close contact with a confirmed patient of coronavirus (defined as being within 2m for more than 15 minutes) should follow the home-quarantine guidance. You should follow the advice of the Israeli Ministry of Health. For more information, you should contact the Israeli Ministry of Health.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.

Local medical care
Healthcare in Israel is not free and medical treatment can be expensive. Hospitals will insist on payment and may take legal action to delay departure until bills are met. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 101 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
