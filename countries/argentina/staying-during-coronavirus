This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Argentina as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Argentina to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Argentina
In Argentina, measures to control the spread of COVID-19 have been extended until at least midnight on 20 December. With the exception of the metropolitan area of Bariloche and Dina Huapi (Rio Negro province), and Puerto Deseado (Santa Cruz), which remain under mandatary social isolation (ie. lockdown), the rest of the country is now in a phase of mandatory social distancing. The restrictions imposed may vary between jurisdictions.
Under mandatory social distancing, free movement is allowed within each jurisdiction provided that social distancing rules are adhered to. The use of public transport within jurisdictions remains restricted to essential workers and those in need of medical treatment.
In all cases, you must cover your nose and mouth with a face mask or other garment whenever you go out in public. You are allowed to travel to an airport if you have a flight booked and you can make single person journeys to buy necessities, such as medicines or foodstuffs, in your local area.
Movement between jurisdictions is restricted to essential workers, those in need of medical treatment, to reunite with family members or to travel to an authorised border to leave the country. Those who qualify need a valid permit to circulate, known as a “Certificado Único de Circulación” which you must carry with you at all times. You must make sure to provide full details of your circumstances in the “Observations” box including:
details of your confirmed international flight if leaving Argentina
details of the hospital if you are travelling for medical treatment
details of your company/employer if travelling as an essential worker
details of your Argentine or resident family member if you are travelling to reunite with your family
You should check what measures apply in your location in the Ministry of Health website (in Spanish). You could be subject to a financial penalty if you do not abide by local regulations.
Visas
The 90-day permission for tourists to stay in Argentina is being extended each month by 30 days, if your original 90 days expired after 17 March. The latest extension was announced on 18 November.
