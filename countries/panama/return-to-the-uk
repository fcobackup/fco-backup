Transport to the airport for flights
Movement within Panama is restricted, but for those with tickets, travel to the airport for repatriation is a valid exemption.
The British Embassy can facilitate a safe passage letter in Spanish and English for the driver for use at checkpoints to and from the airport. Email the British Embassy BEPanama.CV@fco.gov.uk with your flight confirmation and the following details:
the driver’s full name

If you are travelling from outside Panama City, you’re advised to arrive in Panama City on the day before the flight, to prevent any last minute delays. See a list of hotels in Panama City that you may find helpful.
We are monitoring the situation for further departures from Panama but these are likely to be limited until the air embargo is lifted (currently scheduled for 22 July)
