There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Peru. Borders have closed indefinitely since 16 March.
Future travel options
Between 26 March and 15 April, the FCO chartered five British Airways flights to help British nationals in Peru return to the UK. There are no further UK government organised flights planned from Peru.
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Peruvian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible, including from difficult to reach locations in Peru.
If you cannot leave Peru at this time, see advice on staying in Peru during coronavirus.

If you would like to register your details with the British Embassy in Lima be included in communications about possible flights out of Peru, email the British Embassy Lima and include your full name, date of birth, UK passport number, e-mail address and mobile number. The Embassy sometimes hears of flights leaving Peru at short notice. In your e-mail you should indicate if you would be happy for us to share your details with other Embassies and airlines.
Travel to the airport
Curfew and movement restrictions may not apply if you have an internal travel permit (salvo-conducto) from the Peruvian authorities to travel to flights or on pre-arranged transport.
If you need a salvo-conducto, you must contact the British Embassy who will request one on your behalf. You should note that the Peruvian authorities mainly issue salvo-conductos for those with pre-arranged international flights. Please note that the Peruvian government will only issue internal travel permits (salvo-conductos) until 10 July.

are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
