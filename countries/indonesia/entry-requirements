The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Indonesia
All foreign nationals are barred from entering and transiting through Indonesia. There are 6 exceptions to the ban:
foreign nationals with limited (KITAS) and permanent stay (KITAP) permits.
foreign nationals with diplomatic visa and working visa
holders of diplomatic stay permits and business stay permits
those working on medical and food assistance
transportation (air, sea, or land) crew
foreign nationals working on national strategic projects
Entry requirements if you meet the above criteria are:
you must be in possession of a health certificate confirming a negative COVID-19 PCR test (swab test) result. The test must have been taken a maximum of 7 days before arrival and your certificate must be in English. If you arrive without a negative COVID-19 test certificate you will be required to undergo a COVID-19 swab test and quarantine on arrival, at your own expense, until the test results are received. This could take up to 7 days.
you must provide a personal statement stating readiness to be quarantined for up to 14 days if required
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Health certificate
All visitors will also be required to present their health certificate showing a negative COVID-19 PCR test result within the previous 7 days at check-in ahead of any scheduled travel. Failure to present a health certificate may result in you being denied entry or transit in Indonesia. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
On arrival at Indonesian airports, all visitors must also complete and submit a Health Alert certificate to the Health Quarantine Office.
The Government of Indonesia requires that travellers from countries in which the World Health Organisation (WHO) has evidence of local transmission of COVID-19 should self-isolate for 14 days on arrival in Indonesia.
More information is available regarding coronavirus in Indonesia via the Ministry of Health.
Visas
The Indonesian Immigration authority have announced changes to the emergency visa regulations previously introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those with expired visas will need to take the following steps within 30 days from 13 July:
Visa free holders (BVK) must leave Indonesia within 30 days;
Visa on arrival (VKSK) and sponsored visitor visa (ITK) holders can, within 30 days, apply for an extension, if not already granted one;
Those outside Indonesia with an expired KITAS or KITAP need to return to Indonesia within 60 days for renewal, or you will need to apply for a new entry visa from your nearest Indonesian Embassy.
If you do not resolve your immigration status within 30 days, you may face a fine, detention and deportation. Further information is available from the Directorate General of Immigration.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
In normal circumstances, if you’re travelling on a British Citizen passport you don’t need a visa to enter Indonesia for visits of up to 30 days, calculated to include your date of arrival and date of departure. Visa-free visits can’t be extended or transferred to another type of visa. For a list of airports, seaports and land border crossings for entering/exiting Indonesia under this visa waiver scheme, and more information about entry requirements, visit the website of the Indonesian Embassy in London or your nearest Indonesian embassy.
If you’re travelling to Indonesia and intend to stay for more than 30 days (up to a maximum of 60 days), you should apply for a visa before you travel, or apply for a visa on arrival at a cost of US$35, or the equivalent in Indonesian rupiah, at the visa on arrival desk within the airport. These types of visa are valid for 30 days, and can be extended once (for a maximum of 30 days) by making an application for an extension to an immigration office within Indonesia. Ensure that you extend your visa within the initial 30 days to avoid an overstay fine.
The Indonesian embassy has introduced a new e-visa system. You should submit your visa application online. The embassy will no longer accept a handwritten visa application form unless you’re a British Overseas Territories citizen, British National (Overseas), or if you’re applying for a diplomatic visa. If you fall into this category you should send a written request to obtain the visa form at: consular@indonesianembassy.org.
The visa waiver scheme and visas on arrival aren’t available if you’re travelling on a British Overseas Citizen, British Subject, British National (Overseas) or British Overseas Territory citizen passport. Instead, you must apply for a visa before you travel.
These options are also not available if you’re travelling to Indonesia for journalistic purposes. Instead, you must apply for a visa before you travel, and should make sure that you have the correct permits for local travel within Indonesia as some areas may require special permits in addition to your visa. You should seek advice from your nearest Indonesian Embassy.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of your departure from Indonesia.
Indonesian law doesn’t allow dual nationality for adults over 18 years of age. If you’re a British national who has retained Indonesian nationality, you may experience immigration difficulties in Indonesia.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for airside transit and exit from Indonesia. ETDs may also be accepted for entry into Indonesia. If you’re entering Indonesia using an ETD you must apply for a visit visa before travelling. You won’t be able to get a visa on arrival. The processing time for an Indonesian visa can vary depending on where you apply. Some Indonesian embassies don’t issue Indonesian visas in ETDs. Contact your nearest Indonesian Embassy to check before you apply.
Entry requirements may differ if you live in Indonesia. Contact your nearest Indonesian Embassy to confirm whether you need to apply for a visit visa before you travel to Indonesia using an ETD.
If you apply for an ETD whilst in Indonesia, you may need to get an exit permit from Immigration to leave the country. We will advise you to contact the nearest Immigration office to check before travelling.
Proof of onward travel
Immigration officials in Indonesia may ask you for proof of onward travel (eg, a return or onward air ticket). You should make all reservations before leaving for Indonesia. Some airlines have refused to board passengers without evidence of onward travel.
Departure and airport tax
Airport tax is included in the cost your ticket for all domestic flights within Indonesia. For some international flights departing Indonesia, airport tax may not be included in the price of the ticket. Please check with your airline or travel agent before you travel.
Overstaying your visa
Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter and visitors can be held in detention or refused permission to leave the country until a fine of Rp 1 million per day is paid. After overstaying for 60 days, you will be detained and possibly imprisoned.
Registering
If you stay in private accommodation in Indonesia (not a hotel) you must register your presence with the local police or you could face a fine of Rp 5 million. If you stay in a hotel you will be registered automatically.
Travelling with medication
If you bring any prescription medication into Indonesia, make sure you have a copy of the prescription with you. The prescription must cover the quantity of medication you bring. Be aware that some prescription or other medication available in the UK, including some psychotropic medicines, may be illegal in Indonesia. If you’re unsure, speak to your doctor and the Indonesian Embassy for advice before you travel.
