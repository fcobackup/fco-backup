This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Romania set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Romania
The UK is on Romania’s “Red List” of countries of high epidemiological risk.
Travellers arriving from the UK will be required to quarantine for fourteen days, with the exception of anyone who can demonstrate proof of a full course of vaccination against COVID-19, completed at least ten days before arrival in Romania, or proof that they have recovered from COVID-19 between 14 and 90 days before arriving in Romania. (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status’). Travellers who are in possession of a negative RT-PCR test (completed no more than 72 hours before boarding or arriving at the border if travelling independently), will be exempt from the requirement to quarantine, provided they leave Romania within 72 hours of arrival, otherwise they will be expected to quarantine for fourteen days.
All other travellers will be expected to quarantine for fourteen days, unless you fit one of the following categories:
Children aged 3 or under, who do not need to provide a negative RT-PCR test; children aged between 3 and 16 if they provide a negative RT-PCR undertaken a maximum of 72 hours before boarding or arrival if travelling independently.
Anyone from a country of epidemiological risk (over 3 infections per 1000 in the last 14 days) but who has spent the last fourteen days in another country. The most recent list, prior to the addition of the UK, is on the Romanian Government website (in Romanian).
Drivers of goods vehicles with a maximum capacity of 2.4 tonnes; drivers of transport with more than nine seats; pilots, flight crew, locomotive mechanics and railway personnel; sailors disembarking from Romanian flagged ships subject to employers providing relevant safety certificates.
Employees of Romanian companies returning to Romania on completion of a contract and who have proof of employment outside Romania; representatives of foreign companies with representative offices in Romania with proof that they have a contract to work with a company in Romania; technicians with proof they are arriving to work on installation or maintenance or specific tasks with medical, scientific, economic, defence, public order or transport companies.
Diplomats accredited in Bucharest, holders of Diplomatic Passports and their family members.
Members of international sports delegations arriving to take part in competitions in Romania, including referees and accredited journalists; foreign athletes with Romanian clubs returning to Romania following participation in international competitions.
Film crews with contracts to work in Romania holding a negative RT-PCR test completed a maximum of 72 hours prior to boarding or arriving at the border for those travelling independently.
Persons in transit provided they leave within 24 hours.
Persons handed over to the Romanian authorities on the basis of a Readmission Agreement who are being returned in an accelerated procedure.
Employees of Romanian companies who have returned following negotiations or contract signings provided they have a negative RT-PCR completed no more than 72 hours before boarding or on arrival at the border if travelling independently.
The text of the declaration can be found on the Romanian Government website (in Romanian).
These restrictions do not apply to UK nationals who are legally resident in Romania, who will need to show proof of residency to re-enter Romania.

Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
If you live in England, Romania will accept the NHS COVID Pass or your NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. If you live in Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales, Romania will accept your respective letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to Romania for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit for family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day limit in Romania as it is not in the Schengen area. Visits to Romania do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Romanian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Romanian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Romania with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Romania before 1 January 2021 does not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit.
At Romanian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Parental consent when travelling with minors
Some British nationals travelling with minors who hold Romanian citizenship (irrespective of whether they hold citizenship of other countries) are prevented from leaving the country without notarised parental consent from the minor’s non-travelling parent/s. While enforcement of this may vary at borders, British nationals travelling with minors who hold Romanian citizenship should obtain notarised parental consent before departure from Romania.
A list of the public notaries can be found on the website of the National Union of Public Notaries from Romania.

If you intend to work in Romania, you should register with the Romanian Office for Immigrants. You can also register as self-employed.
