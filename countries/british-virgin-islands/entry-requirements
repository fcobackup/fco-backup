This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the BVI Immigration Department.
Passport validity requirements
To visit the BVI, your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay.
 Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
If you are a resident in the BVI, your passport must be valid for at least 3 months after the date you arrive.
Visa requirements
You can visit the BVI without a visa for up to 1 month. The BVI immigration authorities will issue you with a 1-month entry stamp on arrival.  
The Chief Immigration Officer can grant extensions of up to 6 months. You may need to show:
proof of independent financial means
evidence of accommodation
plans to leave the BVI at the end of your stay
For information about work permits or other immigration issues, contact the BVI’s Immigration Department.
The Labour Department handles queries about working in the BVI. If your work permit expires while you are absent from the BVI, you must submit a written request to the Immigration Department at least 5 working days before you travel.  This also applies to holders of work permit exemptions.
