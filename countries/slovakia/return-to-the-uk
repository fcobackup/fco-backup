There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Slovakia, but these are reducing.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Slovakia, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no special charter flight is advertised here.
British travellers in Slovakia are allowed to leave, but international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad are closed to regular scheduled passenger flights.
International rail and bus services have also ceased. Taxis are no longer permitted to carry passengers.
On 10 April, the Austrian government introduced controls at the border with Slovakia. With effect from 14 April, it will also introduce new requirements for those UK nationals transiting Austria and those ending their journey in Austria.
For those transiting Austria, you will have to provide evidence that you are transiting and complete a declaration of transit. For other requirements, check the FCO Travel Advice for Austria.
For those ending their journey in Austria, the Austrian government may require non-residents of Austria to show a medical certificate. For more information, see FCO Travel Advice for Austria
Road
Exit via road to Austria is currently permitted but this may change at short notice. There are restrictions on entry for most British nationals at the borders with Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Ukraine.
To plan your route by road, check the FCO Travel Advice for all the countries you plan to travel through, including for any special documentation required.
Flights
There are indirect scheduled commercial routes to the UK from Vienna and Prague Airports, but these are reducing and may be subject to cancellation at short notice. You should contact the airlines directly. Requirements for crossing the border with Austria and the Czech Republic may change rapidly. Keep up to date with travel advice for all countries you plan to travel through.
For the latest information, please refer to the most recent social media updates from the British Embassy in Bratislava.
