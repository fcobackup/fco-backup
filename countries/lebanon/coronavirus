Travel in Lebanon
When traveling around Lebanon, including to and from the airport, private cars should have no more than three people in them (including the driver), unless they are all from the same household. Other vehicles should limit passenger numbers to a third of total capacity.
On 2 November the Lebanese government amended the curfew hours that had previously been in place. Movement is now prohibited between 9pm and 5am. Public and private gatherings such as weddings and funerals have been banned throughout the country until further notice - you should check with organisers before attending any function.
The airport is operational and all passengers are required to have their tickets with them when transferring to and from the airport. Some exemptions to COVID-19 restrictions are applied to aid workers. For further clarification, aid workers should contact the United Nations for advice.
Fabric masks covering the mouth and nose must be worn when outside the home and in vehicles (unless travelling alone, or exercising). Individuals must maintain a safe distance from one another and avoid crowded areas. Those over the age of 65 years old are advised to stay home and not go out unless absolutely necessary.
In addition, localised lockdowns have been imposed on specific towns throughout Lebanon. Official and private institutions will be shut apart from hospitals, doctors’ surgeries and chemists and supermarkets for delivery only. All places of worship will be closed and all religious services cancelled. Social events and gatherings are banned. These restrictions are updated regularly and you should check in advance before travelling within Lebanon.
Lebanese authorities may issue fines, impose road blocks, or imprison those violating these measures for up to three years. You should comply with all local measures introduced by the Lebanese authorities and obey the instructions of the security forces. These measures may be changed at short notice and further localised lockdowns may be introduced.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.

Public spaces and services
On 8 September, the Lebanese Government announced a continuation of lockdown measures. Essential businesses (e.g. grocery stores, pharmacies) are permitted to operate.
