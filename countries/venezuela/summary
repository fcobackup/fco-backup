For security reasons, the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to:
within 80 km (50 miles) of the Colombian border
within 40 km (25 miles) of the Brazilian border
to Zulia State
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the remaining areas of Venezuela, due to ongoing crime and instability.
COVID-19 entry restrictions for Venezuela

Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
If you’re planning travel to Venezuela, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.

Drug traffickers and illegal armed groups are active along the border area with Colombia and Brazil and there is a risk of kidnapping. See Crime.
Almost all states outside Caracas are experiencing increased crime and instability, including prolonged power cuts as well as water and fuel shortages and a general lack of essential services. Zulia State (bordering Colombia) is subject to prolonged power cuts, water shortages, violence and local conflict. See Crime.
In the event of prolonged power cuts and/or a deterioration on the political or security situation, the British Embassy may be limited in the assistance that it can provide. You should remain vigilant, avoid all demonstrations (tear gas and buck shot can be used), monitor developments closely and keep up to date with this travel advice. You should consider storing several days’ worth of dried/tinned food and water.
Power cuts also affect mobile signals and internet. Caracas International Airport is often affected during power failures, causing flights to be delayed or cancelled. This could affect your ability to depart Venezuela. You should remain in close contact with your airline or travel agent to see if your flight is affected.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Venezuela. See Terrorism
Consular support is not available in many parts of Venezuela. We cannot provide any support in areas where we advise against all travel.
