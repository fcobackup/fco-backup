This page has information on travelling to Seychelles.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Seychelles set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Seychelles’ entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
From 1 December 2022, Seychelles will no longer require COVID-19 vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test from visitors. However, all visitors must complete a digital Travel Authorisation. The Travel Authorisation serves to determine visitors’ travel eligibility to Seychelles prior to the start of travel. This digital form also replaces the paper disembarkation form that was previously completed pre-arrival. There is a fee associated with the application for a Travel Authorisation, which can done be from 10 days before arrival. In case of an emergency or unplanned departure to the Seychelles, an express application is available for an additional fee.
Visitors must also have a valid Travel and Health Insurance to cover for potential COVID-19 related costs.
Proof of vaccination status
Proof of vaccination is no longer required.

Visas
British passport holders do not need a visa for tourist visits. However, it is mandatory for visitors to apply for a digital Travel Authorisation, which determines a person’s travel eligibility to Seychelles. On arrival, you’ll be issued with a visitor’s permit provided that you meet the entry requirements of Seychelles authority. To fulfil the requirements you should:
not be a prohibited immigrant;
not be the holder of a valid permit which entitles you to reside in Seychelles;
hold a valid return or onward ticket for the duration of your visit;
show proof of confirmed accommodation;
have sufficient funds for the duration of your stay.
The visitor’s permit may be granted for a period of visit of up to 3 months. You may apply for an extension for successive periods not exceeding 3 months at a time to a maximum period of 12 months, granted that you fulfil the local authority’s criteria for extension. You can extend at any time before your current visitor’s permit expires.
The visitor’s permit is issued free of charge for the first 3 months but there is a fee for extension covering each period of 3 months or any part thereof.
