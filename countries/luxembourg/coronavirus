Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Luxembourg
In response to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant across Europe, the Luxembourg government is putting in place new measures, effective from 25 December.
Face coverings must be worn on public transport and in all indoor areas open to the public and where the public is circulating.
Breaches of regulations can result in fines of up to €1000.
You must wear a face covering and observe the standard social distancing requirement when travelling through Luxembourg Airport (Findel). Your mask should not be removed during security control. Hand sanitiser is available throughout the terminal where hand washing is unavailable.
Accommodation
Hotel and guesthouse bars and restaurants are now open to the public under the same conditions as all other restaurants, bars and cafes (see below). Face coverings must be worn in public areas, and where the social distancing requirement cannot be met.
Public spaces and services
The government has introduced a voluntary ‘CovidCheck’ system which allows users to demonstrate their health status, including vaccination status and COVID-19 test results. The ‘CovidCheck’ system is mandatory for restaurants, cafes and bars. Businesses can also opt in on a voluntary basis, however there is a difference to measures and restrictions for those who choose not to opt in.
Face coverings must be worn in shops, supermarkets, exhibitions, and other places that are open to the public.
From 25 December, restaurants and bars must close by 11pm. Customers will only be permitted entry if: (i) they have received their booster shot, or (ii) they have been vaccinated and take a rapid COVID-19 test on site which produces a negative result.
Outdoor spaces and terraces must be open on three sides. Take-away, drive-through and home delivery services remain available.
For private gatherings, the followings rules will apply from 25 December:
Only vaccinated or recovered people will be permitted to gather in groups of 10 or more
Only vaccinated or recovered people who have also provided a negative rapid COVID-19 test will be permitted to gather in groups of 20 or more. They will also need to wear masks and maintain a distance of 2 metres. Gatherings of over 100 people may only take place with special dispensation from the Ministry of Health.
Luxembourg will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. However a screenshot or a photo is not sufficient. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November 2021 to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if domestic certification is required. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Cinemas, theatres, nightclubs and cultural events are open but will be required to close by 11pm from 25 December.
Shops, hairdressers and beauticians are open. Indoor sports facilities, gyms, swimming pools and aquatic centres are open with strict hygiene restrictions in place.
To find out more about local restrictions, please refer to the Luxembourg government website.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Luxembourg
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Luxembourg announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Luxembourg national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) and Moderna vaccines. British nationals resident in Luxembourg are eligible for vaccination. Further information can be found in the guidance on how to get a vaccine in Luxembourg. The guidance includes information on the vaccinations strategy and how to book an appointment.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Luxembourg, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Luxembourg, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
