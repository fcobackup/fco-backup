Local measures
The Government of Botswana declared a State of Public Emergency on 31 March, which has since been extended to six months.
A number of other measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic have been introduced, including legislation that makes it compulsory to wear masks / face coverings in public places, businesses and common areas of residential buildings.
There will be a phased lifting of the lockdown restrictions from 8-14 May and 15-22 May enabling schools and businesses to reopen under certain conditions. Travel permits are still required until 20 May. From 21 May, the country will be divided into coronavirus zones and travel permits will be required to travel between these zones. You should comply with these requirements wherever you are staying in Botswana and continue to follow the advice of the Government of Botswana and local authorities.
You can find the latest updates about the phased lifting of the lockdown restrictions, coronavirus zones, masks / face coverings guidance and travel permit forms at the Government of Botswana’s Facebook page.
International travel
There are currently no commercial flights in to or out of Botswana. Medical evacuation flights remain possible. The Botswana authorities have also closed land border posts with neighbouring countries. Only citizens and residents will be allowed entry. Returning residents, including from the UK, will be subject to a 14-day mandatory quarantine period in government facilities.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or nearest Botswana Embassy or High Commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Flights in to and out of Botswana from South Africa are affected by South Africa’s own COVID-19 response. Follow our travel advice for South Africa for information on South African entry requirements, and consult your nearest South African High Commission.
