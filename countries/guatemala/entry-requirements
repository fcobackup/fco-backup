This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Guatemala set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
You must keep to the social distancing rules and wear a mask at all times, in all public spaces, including at the airport.
To be eligible for entry, you must comply with one of the following options:
a. You must provide a negative COVID-19 PCR or antigen test (if aged 10 or over) dated no more than 3 days before the date of your arrival in Guatemala. The 3 days commence from the date and time the test is conducted to the moment you check-in with the airline, or arrival at land border
b. If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past 3 months, you must present a medical certificate from the health clinic where you were treated, that states the date you were diagnosed with COVID-19 (including the copy of the test) and confirmation of your recovery.
c. If you have received the COVID-19 vaccine, you must present evidence that you have received two doses (one dose if vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine). The last dose must have been administered no less than 2 weeks prior to the date of travel.
Local authorities have advised against travel if suffering from any respiratory disease or presenting COVID-19 symptoms.
Testing/screening on arrival
You should comply with any additional screening or testing measures put in place by the authorities.
Quarantine requirements
There are no quarantine requirements. Upon arrival, you are required to present a negative COVID-19 PCR or antigen test, dated no more than 72 hours prior to check in at the airport, or arrival at land border. In some cases, people may be required to self-isolate for a period of 10 days.
Testing on departure
There is currently no testing upon departure in Guatemala. They will take your temperature upon arrival at the airport.
Mexico-Guatemala border
There have been reports of disruptions and tensions at the Mexico-Guatemala border. Periodic closures are possible and you are advised to check with local authorities before attempting to cross the land border.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British citizens do not need a visa to visit Guatemala for up to 90 days. For further information on entry requirements for tourists and for those planning to work in Guatemala, contact the Guatemalan Embassy in London.
If you wish to extend your visa, you must submit an application to the Guatemalan Institute of Migration in Guatemala City. You can find more information on the website of the Guatemalan Institute of Migration (in Spanish).
If you overstay your visa then you should expect to pay a fine before leaving the country. This fine can only be paid at the main Migration office in Guatemala City. Fines can’t be paid at the airport or land borders.
The State of Calamity, which commenced on 5 March 2020, ended on 5 October. During which time, the length of stay for tourist permits was frozen. Now that the State of Calamity has ended, the length of stay has been unfrozen, and will be deducted as normal.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into Guatemala.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry to and exit from Guatemala. ETDs must have a minimum period of 6 months validity from the date you enter Guatemala.
If you’re travelling via the United States of America on an ETD, you’ll need to get a USA visa. For more information, please contact the USA Embassy in Guatemala.
Central America Border Control Agreement
Guatemala is part of the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4). Under the terms of this agreement, British tourists can travel within any of the CA-4 countries (Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala) for a period of up to 90 days without completing entry and exit formalities at border immigration checkpoints. This period begins at the first point of entry of any of the CA-4 countries. Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90-day limit, although a request for an extension can be made for up to 30 days by paying a fee before the 90 days limit expires. If you are expelled from any of the four countries you are also excluded from the entire CA-4 region.
If you are planning on travelling to Nicaragua, before you travel please check information on entry requirements with your travel company, the Nicaraguan Immigration authorities, or your nearest Nicaraguan Embassy. Please also check our travel advice for Nicaragua.
Departure tax
There is a US$30 (or Quetzal equivalent) airport departure tax, which is normally included in the price of the ticket.
When crossing into Guatemala by land border, there have been numerous reports of customs/immigration officials charging an “entry fee”. This is illegal. By asking for an official receipt for your money you may find that the “fee” is dropped.
When entering the country, make sure your passport is stamped by a migration official. If you enter Guatemala without obtaining the relevant stamp, you are likely to receive a fine and may experience delays when leaving the country.
When crossing into Guatemala by the land border at El Carmen, be wary of people offering to help process your entry into the country.
