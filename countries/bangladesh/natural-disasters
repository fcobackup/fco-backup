Tropical cyclones
The climate in Bangladesh is sub-tropical and governed by monsoon winds. Extreme weather episodes like tropical cyclones can occur. Cyclonic storm Bulbul is forecast to bring heavy rainfall and high winds to large parts of Bangladesh from around Friday 8 November. Updated weather reports can be found on the websites of the Bangladesh Meteorological Department and the World Meteorological Organisation.
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if youâ€™re caught up in a storm.
Monsoon season
In the monsoon season from June to September there is widespread and extensive flooding.  This can disrupt travel particularly in rural areas. Check that routes are passable before setting out on long journeys.
Earthquakes
Around one half of Bangladesh, including the cities of Moulvibazar and Sylhet, is located in a high-risk earthquake zone. Most of the rest, including Dhaka, is considered moderate risk. Tremors and earthquakes, usually minor ones, occur from time to time. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Tsunamis
Bangladesh can be affected by tsunamis and the government of Bangladesh can issue tsunami warnings. Monitor local news and follow any advice given by the local authorities.
