Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

Credit cards are accepted by a few of the larger hotels and restaurants in Ouagadougou. You are unlikely to be able to use them anywhere outside the capital. Other brands of credit cards are not accepted. There are a few ATMs in Ouagadougou (Visa only). Travellers’ cheques are exchangeable in banks in Ouagadougou. Euro travellers’ cheques are exchanged at the fixed rate prevailing between the CFA Franc and the Euro. Exchange rates on travellers’ cheques in other currencies can be poor. In general, and in particular outside Ouagadougou, you should make sure you have enough cash to cover any eventuality.
