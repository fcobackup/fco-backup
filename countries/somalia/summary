The security situation across Somalia remains extremely volatile; you should exercise extreme caution.
If you do choose to travel to Somalia, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Somalia’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Somalia. There is a high threat of kidnap throughout the country. A number of Western nationals, including British nationals, have been kidnapped in Somalia and some have been killed. Terrorist groups have made threats against westerners and those working for western organisations. There is a constant threat of terrorist attack in Mogadishu and terrorists continue to plan attacks against westerners in the rest of Somalia, including Somaliland. Terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, including in crowded places, high-profile events, events involving government officials and in places visited by foreigners. Due to their use by government officials, hotels are considered legitimate targets by terrorist groups. See Terrorism
Political and community-based violence is commonplace across Somalia and can flare up with little warning. See Safety and Security.
Piracy in the waters off Somalia has been suppressed but not eradicated. The area of the Southern Red Sea remains a hotspot for maritime security incidents. See Sea travel
Conflict and environmental problems such as drought and flooding have displaced hundreds of thousands of people, in all areas of the country. See Local travel
Land borders with countries neighbouring Somalia may close at short notice. You should check with local authorities before travelling to the border. You should also monitor Travel Advice for Ethiopia, Kenya or Djibouti. You should not cross the border without the correct documents.
Consular support is severely limited in Somalia. The British Embassy in Mogadishu and British Office Hargeisa do not provide consular services. If you’re in Somalia (excluding Somaliland) and need urgent help from the UK government (e.g. if you’ve been arrested or you’re concerned about forced marriage), contact the British High Commission in Nairobi. If you’re in Somaliland, you should contact the British Embassy in Addis Ababa. If you’re in the UK and are concerned about a British national in Somalia (including Somaliland), call the FCDO on 020 7008 5000.
