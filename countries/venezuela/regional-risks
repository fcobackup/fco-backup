Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Venezuela.

This section has safety advice for regions of Venezuela. It only covers regions where Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.  
Within 80km of the Venezuela-Colombia border
FCDO advises against all travel to within 80km (50 miles) of the border with Colombia. Drug traffickers and illegal armed groups are active along the border area with Colombia and there is a risk of criminal kidnapping. Crossing the border from Colombia can be a lengthy process.
Zulia State
FCDO advises against all travel to Zulia State, which borders Colombia and is subject to prolonged power cuts, water shortages, violence and local conflict.
Within 40km of the Venezuela-Brazil border
FCDO advises against all travel to within 40km (25 miles) of the border with Brazil. Drug traffickers and illegal armed groups are active along the border area with Brazil and there is a risk of criminal kidnapping. Crossing the border from Brazil can be a lengthy process.
Check the situation ahead of any travel to Canaima National Park and the Gran Sabana area of Bolívar State. Occasionally, protests by locals have led to the closure, sometimes for days, of Canaima airport. Main road closures may include parts of Road 10 between El Callao and the Venezuela-Brazil border. 
All other areas of Venezuela
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the remaining areas of Venezuela. Almost all states outside Caracas are experiencing increased crime and instability, including prolonged power cuts as well as water and fuel shortages and a general lack of essential services.
During power cuts or in an unstable security situation, the British Embassy may be limited in the assistance that it can provide.
