Travel to Croatia may be subject to entry restrictions

Limited exemptions apply (but these are subject to evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test result, undertaken up to 48 hours before arrival in Croatia, and a mandatory 14 day isolation period if you’re travelling to Croatia from the UK, South Africa or Brazil).
