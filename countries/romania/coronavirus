Returning to the UK

You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. For a list of Romanian Healthcare centres offering COVID tests, you should consult the Ministry of Health website (only available in Romanian).
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
