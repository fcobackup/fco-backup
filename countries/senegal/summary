The Senegal authorities have introduced new measures in relation to coronavirus. See Coronavirus and Return to the UK.
Strikes, political demonstrations and social protests are a relatively frequent occurrence, particularly in Dakar but also other cities. These are normally peaceful, but can sometimes turn violent. You should exercise caution and avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are likely.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Senegal. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
You should be vigilant when travelling in Casamance, the region south of The Gambia. Where possible you should avoid travelling at night, stick to main roads and travel in a convoy when you can. The Casamance region has suffered from decades of low intensity separatist violence, largely directed at Senegalese security forces. While the security situation has improved significantly since 2012, there are occasionally violent incidents, including armed attacks on travellers. Mines remain in this area from years of conflict.
There is a lower level of risk in the main tourist areas of the Casamance. See Local travel
Pickpocketing and street crime are common in parts of Dakar, particularly around Place de l’Indépendance, the central area of the Plateau and the Western Corniche, as well as Goree Island. See Safety and security
Be cautious when changing cash given the risk of false money circulating.
Most visits to Senegal are trouble-free.
