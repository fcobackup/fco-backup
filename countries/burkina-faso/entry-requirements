This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Burkina Faso set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Burkina Faso
Commercial flights to and from Burkina Faso remain limited. Check with your travel company for the latest information. Land and sea borders remain closed until further notice.
All international travellers will need to present a negative COVID 19 PCR test certificate dated no more than 5 days prior to arrival in Burkina Faso.
Passengers arriving in Burkina Faso without a negative PCR test dated no more than 5 days prior to entry will have their identity documents temporarily confiscated by the authorities and will be required to take a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and a PCR test. Confiscated identity documents will be returned after verification of payment for the tests. In the event of a positive RDT test, travellers will be placed in quarantine at their own expense at a government allocated hotel for 72 hours while awaiting the results of the PCR test. RDT and PCR tests are free for children under 6 years old. For those passengers aged 6 and over there is a sum of 90,000 FCFA (approximately £118) to pay in cash to the health authorities at the airport.
All travellers departing Burkina Faso will need to present a negative PCR test certificate dated no more than 5 days prior to departure. Tests cost 25,000 FCFA (approximately £32).
