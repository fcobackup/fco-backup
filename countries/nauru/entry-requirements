Entry to Nauru

All passengers must check in to the Pre-Travel Managed Accommodation Hotel (property address advised by Nauru authorities close to travel date) four days prior to travel to Nauru.
All passengers must be fully vaccinated at least 14 days prior to their travel date. A negative Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) must be taken within 24 hours of flight departure. A PCR test will need to be taken whilst in the Pre-Travel Managed Accommodation Hotel.
All passengers must complete a Nauru Health Declaration prior to travel and undertake five days mandatory hotel quarantine on arrival in Nauru.
Testing / screening on arrival
All persons travelling to Nauru need to undergo pre-travel screening.
Quarantine requirements
Effective from 16 March 2020, all persons arriving in Nauru will need to spend up to 14 days in “Government Transition Accommodation” in Nauru.
Travel via Australia and New Zealand
The government of Australia has announced that from 9pm Australia Eastern Standard Time on 20 March, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March. As many flight connections to and from Nauru connect in Australia and New Zealand, options to depart Nauru are likely to reduce.
