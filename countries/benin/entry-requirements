This page has information on travelling to Benin.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Benin set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Benin’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers

There is an online guidance page (in French) which explains the steps for departing passengers and test results can be obtained within 24 to 48 hours.
