During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
The Sudanese authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of coronavirus, including restricting travel, and night curfews across the country. If you’re visiting Sudan and are unable to return to the UK, see Coronavirus
The Sudanese authorities have approved flights to and from some regional countries. See Entry requirements.
Given the rapidly changing situation in Sudan, we have temporarily withdrawn a limited number of UK staff and their dependants from our Embassy. The Embassy continues to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Sudan.
While the broader political and security situation in Sudan has stabilised since April 2019, you should continue to maintain a high level of vigilance across the country, avoid all protests and large gatherings, monitor developments closely and follow the instructions of local authorities and security services. See Political situation
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Sudan where the FCO has existing advice against all travel and all but essential travel (as set out above). The British Embassy no longer registers British nationals in Sudan and the capacity of the British Embassy to help in times of crisis may be limited. You should consider your own travel arrangements carefully and make sure you have up-to-date travel documents and visas in case you need to leave at short notice. See this crisis guidance page for more information about the precautions you should take in the event of a crisis and the help and support the British Embassy can provide.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Sudan. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. See Terrorism
You will need a visa to visit Sudan. See Visas
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
