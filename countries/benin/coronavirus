Other measures include social distancing, prohibiting shared public transport, closing bars and nightclubs and not allowing groupings of more than 10 people. The wearing of masks is now mandatory in public places.
Entry and borders
As of 19 March, entry visas are restricted. Entry and exit at border crossings is limited to “extreme necessity” and authorised in liaison with bordering countries. From 7 April, the land border with Togo is closed. There are a limited number of commercial flights still operating in and out of Benin.
Screening and quarantine
Cotonou Cadjehoun International Airport has reinforced measures in place for visitors arriving in Benin. Quarantine in allocated hotels is obligatory for all passengers arriving in Benin via air. Foreign nationals will be required to cover their own costs of quarantine. Quarantine areas will be guarded by defence and security forces to ensure that quarantine regulations are strictly adhered to.
The Benin authorities are encouraging those with any information or concerns about coronavirus to call these numbers: +229 95 36 11 07, +229 51 02 00 00 or +229 51 04 00 00. This includes reporting those who are not respecting the preventative measures imposed by the authorities.
