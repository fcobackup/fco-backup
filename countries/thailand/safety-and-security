Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Thailand.

You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and regional risks advice.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Thailand
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Thailand.
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the following due to regular terrorist attacks:
Pattani province
Yala province
Narathiwat province
Southern Songkhla province, except for the areas north of and including the A43 road between Hat Yai and Sakom; and the areas north-west of the train line which runs between Hat Yai and Padang Besar
Hat Yai to Padang Besar train line, which was attacked in 2022
Martial law is in place in most areas in these provinces, which means security forces have greater security enforcement and investigative powers.
However, terrorist attacks could take place anywhere in Thailand. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
Targets might include:
security forces
government offices
hotels
shops and supermarkets
transport infrastructure
Recent attacks include:
in 2019, there were a number of small explosions in Bangkok Satun City, and Phatthalung province in the south of Thailand
in 2018, there was a series of small explosions on Samila beach in Songkhla City
Political situation
The political situation can be unpredictable and has led to periods of civil and political unrest. Avoid protests, political gatherings, demonstrations and marches.
Crime
Personal ID
Police may ask to check your passport. If you do not have it with you, you could be arrested.
Reporting a crime
Report any crime to the Thai police before you leave Thailand. Your case may not be investigated if you try to report it later.
Local authorities, including the police, may pass details of a crime, including photos, to the media without a person’s consent.
Protecting your belongings
You should:
be aware of pickpockets and bag snatchers, especially thieves on motorbikes
take care when travelling in open transport like tut-tuts
keep valuables secure and out of sight
avoid sleeping on buses and trains – people have had items taken from bags while asleep
Keep hold of your passport. Don’t hand it over as a guarantee, for example to motorcycle or jet ski rental businesses. Companies may hold on to passports against claimed damage.
Violent crime
Violent crime, including gun crime, rarely involves tourists. However several foreign nationals were victims of gun violence in Bangkok in 2018. Take care when travelling in unfamiliar areas and avoid walking through isolated areas alone, especially at night.
Sexual assault
Violent sexual assaults and unprovoked attacks can happen in tourist areas across Thailand. Attacks are most common during full moon parties or similar events, and near bars late at night.
Drink spiking
Drink spiking and drug-assisted sexual assault does happen in tourist areas around Thailand, with male and female victims. Do not leave your drinks unattended or accept drinks from strangers.
Be drink aware
Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Alcohol and drugs can make you less alert and less aware of your environment. This can make you more vulnerable to accidents, injuries, robbery and assaults.
Scams
Be aware of credit card fraud. Do not lose sight of your card during transactions. There have been incidents of ATM skimming. Use an ATM in a bank and always protect your PIN.
Be wary of job offers that appear too good to be true. People have arrived in Thailand and been illegally transported to neighbouring countries on the promise of high-paying jobs, which turn out to be scams. When you re-enter Thailand you may then be detained while your immigration status is validated.
There have been incidents of:
passports confiscated by scammers
victims being held in poor living conditions
coercion into undertaking wider online scamming activity
pressure to make large payments to be released from sham jobs
Detention facilities
Conditions in prisons and other detention facilities in Thailand are harsh, with limited access to healthcare. Detainees have died in custody.
Laws and cultural differences
You should be aware of differences between UK and Thai law and local customs.
The British Embassy in Bangkok has a video on what to be aware of when living or travelling in Thailand:
Facebook – visiting Thailand video
Twitter – visiting Thailand video
Criticising the Thai monarchy
Criticising the Thai monarchy (lèse-majesté) is illegal. The law can be interpreted broadly and carries a long jail sentence. British and Thai journalists, human rights defenders, and members of the public have faced charges for raising concerns, making political comments, sharing articles online that could been seen as negative towards Thailand, or making accusations about individuals.
Posting images on social media
Posting images on social media of people drinking alcohol or wearing clothing considered inappropriate can be illegal. Both the person who uploaded the images and the people in them could be fined or imprisoned.
Smoking and e-cigarette bans
While cigarettes are common, you could be fined up to 5,000 Thai baht for smoking them in public. E-cigarettes are illegal. You could be fined or imprisoned for using them.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Thailand has strict laws against drug use, possession and trafficking. Possessing small quantities of illegal substances can lead to heavy fines or imprisonment. Possessing Class A drugs can lead to the death penalty.
Private recreational use of cannabis is legal if the Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content is below 0.2% by weight. Cannabis use in public places is illegal. The Ministry of Public Health has made it legal to grow, use, distribute and sell cannabis products, but this has not been enshrined in law so some restrictions may remain. Check with the local authorities if you are unsure.
See more information on usage, and registration for distributing or selling cannabis, on PR Thai Government (Thai Ministry of Public Health).
Some British nationals have suffered severe psychiatric problems because of drug use, sometimes leading to suicide.
While cannabis is legal in Thailand in certain circumstances, be aware of the next place you are travelling to, where it may be illegal. This includes residual amounts, for example in bags, clothing or blood.
Under UK law, cannabis remains a Class B drug, and it is illegal to take cannabis into the UK.
LGBT+ travellers
Thailand is generally a safe place for LGBT+ travellers.
Thailand has no legislation on same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriages are not legally recognised. Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs
It’s illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a license. Ivory trade is banned.
Buying property in Thailand
Buying property in Thailand is not straightforward. Make sure you understand local laws and consult a lawyer before making financial commitments. British people have been victims of property scams.
Outdoor activities
Elephant treks
Elephant treks can be dangerous, especially if elephants are mistreated or not handled properly. Use a reliable, licensed tour guide. British nationals have been seriously injured and killed because handlers have lost control of the elephant.
Swimming safely
Take care when swimming off coastal areas, especially during monsoon season. People have drowned in strong riptides. You should:
follow warning signs, especially red flags
only swim from approved beaches, with flags
Jellyfish can swim close to the shore, particularly during the rainy season. Jellyfish stings can be fatal. Take local advice from hotel management and dive centres.
Take care when swimming, diving, kayaking or white water rafting in rivers or close to waterfalls, particularly in the rainy season. Currents can be extremely strong.
Diving
Diving schools and rescue service standards are not always as high as in the UK. Check the dive operator’s credentials and make sure you’re covered by your insurance.
If you’ve had no previous diving experience:
ask your dive operator to explain what cover they offer before signing up
check safety equipment is available on the boat
Check that they have appropriate plans in place for emergencies, including their ability to get assistance to evacuate divers to the nearest hyperbaric chamber.
Transport risks
Road traffic accidents
Thailand has a high number of road traffic accidents, particularly with motorcycles. The World Health Organisation (WHO) ranks Thailand as one of the world’s deadliest countries for fatalities on motorcycles.
Licenses and permits
Apply for a Thai driving licence or, if you already hold a UK licence, an International Driving Permit.
If you drive a car or ride a motorcycle in Thailand without a valid licence, it could invalidate your travel insurance if you have an accident or injury.
Car and motorcycle hire
Motorcycles and scooters for hire in beach resorts are often unregistered and cannot be used legally on a public road. Before you hire a vehicle, make sure you’re covered by your travel insurance and check the small print of the lease agreement.
Do not hand over your passport as a guarantee against returning a motorcycle or scooter.
By law, you must wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle.
Sea travel
Lots of passenger boat services operate between the mainland and islands. Boats can sink or collide, which has led to fatalities, including of British nationals. Accidents are usually due to:
overloading
poor maintenance
rough seas, particularly during monsoon season
Travellers with limited mobility
Wheelchair access is often limited across Thailand due to uneven paving, obstacles and a lack of facilities such as lifts and ramps. This includes public transport systems. Many taxis have limited storage space for wheelchairs.
See FCDO advice on disability and travelling abroad.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Rainy season
The rainy season is generally from May to October. In Koh Samui and the south east of Thailand it is from November to March. However, the rainy season has been more unpredictable recently.
Heavy storms cause disruption including flooding and landslides. Lakes, caves and waterfalls are particularly at risk of dangerous flash flooding.
Follow the Thai Meteorological Department for weather warnings.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes and tremors can happen in Northern Thailand.
Earthquake Track lists recent activity.
See the US Federal Emergency Management Agency for what to do in an earthquake.
