The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Visa
South Korean diplomatic missions in the UK are now issuing most types of long-term visas, including working visas. Visa on arrival for British passport holders remains in place, though you should be aware of the quarantine requirements set out below. You should check visa requirements with the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in London.
Transiting in South Korea
All transit passengers receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination. They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport).
Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport.
Testing / screening on arrival
All foreign nationals arriving in South Korea are required to provide a negative PCR test declaration, issued within 72 hours of departure. More details can be found on the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in London website.
All arrivals – regardless of nationality and length of stay – are also required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) after entering South Korea. Arrivals will be taken for testing and must remain at the testing facility until a negative result has been secured.
Travellers with a Korean government-approved official vaccination certificate showing that they have received two vaccine doses in South Korea more than 14 days before their departure from the country may be exempted from compulsory quarantine on their return. Those exempted need to comply with active health monitoring through an app, undertake two compulsory COVID tests and limit some activities for a 14 day period. Arrivals from South Africa and Brazil are not eligible for this exemption.
Korean nationals and long-term foreign visitors with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence, but without an official Korean government-approved vaccination certificate, may self-quarantine at home for 14 days. All other foreign short-term travellers without a Korean government-approved vaccination certificate must quarantine at a government-designated facility for 14 days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of 120,000KRW (approximately £81) while in government quarantine facilities. South Korea plans to recognise vaccination certificates from other countries from 1 July as discussed above.
There is currently no charge for hospital/community centre treatment for British nationals testing positive for COVID-19. It is worth noting that individuals testing positive on arrival may spend over a month in hospital/community treatment centres before testing negative and being discharged.
Any travellers displaying symptoms or returning a positive test result for COVID-19 must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment, deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and the individual may be held liable for economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors.
For more information contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 (support is available in English).
As of 1 July, if you are fully vaccinated and travelling for business, academic or humanitarian purposes, you are eligible to receive a quarantine exemption even if you received your vaccination outside South Korea.
Please note that:
The Embassy of the Republic of Korea in London will publish details on how to apply in due course, including details on what evidence of vaccination status will be accepted from the UK
To be eligible, you will need to have been fully vaccinated two weeks before entering Korea, and to have received a vaccine authorised for emergency use by the WHO (all vaccines in use in the UK have been authorised by the WHO)
If you were vaccinated outside the UK, you will need to apply through the Korean Embassy in the country where you received your vaccination
Exemptions will not be available if you are travelling from South Africa, Malawi, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Equatorial Guinea, Brazil, Suriname, Paraguay or Chile
Exemptions will be available for unvaccinated children under age 6 who are travelling with their parents, but not for unvaccinated children aged 6-18
You will only be able to travel for “humanitarian purposes” in order to attend a funeral (within 14 days) or to visit family
Not all family members qualify – you will be able to visit your spouse and anyone in you or your spouse’s “direct lineage”, meaning parents or grandparents and children or grandchildren, but not siblings
If visiting family, you will need to include in your application proof of your relationship to your family member and proof that they are a legal, long-term resident in Korea
If you are travelling for business or academic purposes, you will need to obtain special approval from the relevant Korean ministries
If you are travelling for business, your employer will be able to apply through the Business Support Centre (in Korean)
You will still need to submit a PCR test result on arrival, take a PCR test on arrival and on day 6 or 7, and comply with active health monitoring through the Korean government app
This is an evolving area and the Korean government has not yet published full details of how the application process will work. This travel advice will be updated when more information is available. You can subscribe to our email alert service to be notified of future updates
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Demonstrating your vaccination status from the UK is not formalised for entry into South Korea, so you should follow alternative advice for entry. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Data collection
Individuals from the UK will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile app.
Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you have a British Citizen passport you can enter South Korea as a tourist for up to 90 days without a visa, though you should remain aware of the quarantine requirements. You must also have an onward or return ticket. It’s illegal to work on a tourist visa, whether as a teacher or in any other capacity.
If you have a different type of British nationality, or are travelling for any purpose other than tourism, you should check visa requirements with the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in London.
Long-term visa holders
Foreign nationals residing in South Korea on most types of long-term visa need to apply for a re-entry permit at a local immigration office or at the airport before undertaking any travel out of South Korea. You should engage early with the Immigration Authorities and apply for a re-entry permit in good time ahead of any planned travel.
Long-term visa holders leaving South Korea without a re-entry permit will have their visa and Alien Registration Card cancelled and will need to obtain a new long-term visa before they can re-enter South Korea. There is no longer a requirement for re-entry permit holders to obtain a medical certificate before returning to South Korea, but all travellers require a negative COVID test certificate as detailed above.
Exceptions to the re-entry permit requirement include holders of A-1, A-2, A-3 and F-4 visas, or those issued with an Isolation Exemption Certificate by a Korean Embassy or consulate overseas. The issue of Isolation Exemption Certificates has also been temporarily suspended by the South Korean Embassy in London.
For further information, call the Korean Immigration Contact Centre (Tel: 1345) or see the official announcement here.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of entry into South Korea.
All foreigners living in South Korea are required to report any changes in their passport information (such as when receiving a new passport) either online using the Korean Immigration Office website or by visiting a local immigration office in South Korea. For further information, call the Korean Immigration Contact Centre (Tel: +82 1345).
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from South Korea.
Customs declarations
Check the website of the Korea Customs Service for information on restricted or prohibited items that may not be brought into the country. If you are in any doubt about the legality of any items - including medications - you should declare them on entry.
South Korean customs authorities allow you to bring small amounts of medication for your personal use, provided that it is kept in carry-on baggage. It is advised to take an English language prescription from your doctor at home for both your prescription drugs and non-prescription medicines. It is also a good idea to consult the website of the South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety before you travel to South Korea.
British males of Korean origin
If you are a British male of Korean origin whose name appears on the Korean family register, you may be liable for military service even if you are travelling on your British passport.
Employment
To get a visa to teach English in South Korea, you must have a 3-year university degree. A TEFL qualification alone is not sufficient. If you are found to have obtained a teaching visa by deception, you will be detained and deported.
British nationals teaching English in South Korea have sometimes found living and working conditions to be below expectations, and have encountered difficulties getting the correct visas and residence permits. There have also been complaints of breach of contract, confiscation of passports, payment being withheld and inadequate or no medical insurance. Check all terms and conditions of your employment carefully and if possible speak to other teachers from the place where you plan to work before accepting any offer.
For those in possession of a work visa, all employment changes must be authorised by Korean Immigration.
