Travel in Pakistan
Public transport has restarted to varying extents across Pakistan, depending on the province, including buses, trains and taxis. Domestic flights restarted on a limited basis on 16 May from Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Quetta and Peshawar. You must wear a face covering when in public across Pakistan including on public transport, punishable by fine.
Local authorities can impose local restrictions on travel to prevent the spread of coronavirus. You should follow the federal and relevant provincial guidance, and monitor local media for updates.
Travel to the airport
You will need to arrange your own travel to the airport. Due to government restrictions, public transport can be limited, and the authorities have discouraged all non-essential use of public transport. If you are travelling to Islamabad you should, if possible, carry printed copies of your flight confirmation and have your passports easily to hand. If you cannot get a printed flight confirmation, carry an electronic copy.
Provincial and federal authorities have stated that you will be able to travel to the airport if you have a confirmed flight ticket and valid travel document. Some provinces have limited the number of people that can be in a vehicle. In addition, people who do not have a flight ticket, except the driver, may not be allowed to accompany travellers to the airport.
If you have been placed into a quarantine centre, or you are in an area that has been quarantined by the authorities, you may have to wait until the quarantine is lifted before you can travel to the airport. Follow the advice of the relevant local authorities. If you are not allowed to travel across a checkpoint whilst travelling to an airport for your flight or if you are moved to a quarantine facility, call the British High Commission on 051 201 2000.
You are strongly advised not to travel to the airport if you are displaying any COVID-19 symptoms, including a high temperature. When you enter the airport, you will be thermal scanned by the Pakistani authorities. If you have a high temperature or other COVID-19 symptoms, you will not be permitted to fly and may be asked to self-isolate for 14 days before you can travel. You may also be referred to a medical facility. Call us on 051 201 2000 if you are moved to a medical facility.
Public places and services
Pakistani authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including school closures. There are restrictions on public gatherings, including religious congregations, events in wedding halls, and sports matches. Across Pakistan, it is now mandatory to wear a face mask in public and not wearing one is punishable by a fine.
There are additional varying measures in force in each province including compulsory isolation or quarantine for people who have COVID-19 symptoms, or people who have come into contact with others with COVID-19 symptoms. In some cases, local authorities are quarantining specific areas. Some provinces have introduced powers to fine or arrest anyone breaking the rules.
You should follow the federal and relevant provincial guidance, and monitor local media for updates. Plan any movements accordingly.
At the airport
You must wear a face mask at the airport. You will need to bring your own mask with you. Airlines and airport authorities will not provide masks.
You’re advised to bring sufficient food for your wait at the airport and a refillable water bottle.
