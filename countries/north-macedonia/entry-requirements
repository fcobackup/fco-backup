The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to North Macedonia
North Macedonia have suspended all direct flights from the United Kingdom until the end of 2020. Passengers arriving from the UK via any route need to self-isolate for 14 days and fill in a form regarding personal and accommodation details on arrival. If you are due to travel, please contact your travel operator. Further updates will be published when they are available. Check our advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned.
All land border crossings in North Macedonia are open for movement of passengers and vehicles. However neighbouring countries may have different entry and exit restrictions on their side of the border. Please check before travelling.
Skopje International Airport and Ohrid Airport “St. Apostle Paul” are open and commercial flights have resumed, but with reduced schedules.
Anyone entering the country directly or indirectly from the UK need to self-isolate for 14 days, but do not need to present a PCR test. British nationals entering the country from elsewhere do not need to present a PCR test, but may be asked to confirm their travel route or when they were last in the UK.
Some border crossings in neighbouring countries are still closed or subject to entry requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that you can enter the next country on your journey. Check country-specific FCDO Travel Advice for details.
