Religions have a strong influence on life in Côte d’Ivoire, which has a tradition of respecting different beliefs and faiths. You should respect local religious customs and traditions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure they do not cause offence. There are conservative standards of dress and behaviour in the country and you should take care not to offend. Possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs is a serious offence and can result in lengthy prison sentences and heavy fines. It is prohibited to take photographs near sensitive installations, including military sites and government buildings, e.g. radio and TV stations, the Presidency building, airport, de Gaulle and Houphouet-Boigny bridges in Abidjan.
Homosexuality is not illegal in Côte d’Ivoire but the law does not recognise same sex partnerships or marriage. Public attitudes may be less tolerant and there are no specific anti-discrimination laws protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender individuals. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
