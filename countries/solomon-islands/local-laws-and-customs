Read what you can and cannot do

Drug use is illegal in Solomon Islands, and can lead to prison sentences.
Swearing is a crime and can lead to large compensation claims and even jail.
Dress codes, particularly for women, are modest. In certain areas there are ‘tabu’ sites only visited by men.
Land ownership in Solomon Islands is an important and sensitive issue. Walking and trekking off the beaten track, or the use of many of the beaches around Honiara, may require payment of a ’kastom’ fee to the landowner.
Homosexual acts are illegal in Solomon Islands and the penalties can include custodial sentences. Open displays of affection are likely to offend. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
