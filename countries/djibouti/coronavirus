The Djibouti authorities have introduced precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
The Republic of Djibouti suspended all international commerical passenger flights to and from Djibouti from 18 March for an indefinite period. Land borders are also closed.
The Government of Djibouti has also introduced new measures at Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport to monitor coronavirus. Anyone arriving in Djibouti-Mabouli International Airport will have their temperature measured and passport checks for recent travel to affected areas. Passengers displaying symptoms linked to coronavirus will be transferred to a nearby isolation facility while further tests are carried out and, if found to be positive, placed in a treatment facility which has been recently established.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England, and the TravelHealthPro website.
