The UAE have announced that inbound and outbound flights will stop as of midnight Tuesday 24 March.
We know that British travellers in the UAE will have been affected by the recent suspension of flights. The British Embassy is collecting information to help understand how.
If you are a remaining British traveller and in difficulty, contact the British Embassy on uaeconsular.escalations@fco.gov.uk. Include your full name, passport number, visa status (resident or tourist), contact details and your particular circumstances.
In the meantime, you should continue to contact your airline or tour operator regarding any possible return flights. This will ensure any demand is logged in the airlines own assumptions about the number of people waiting to return to the UK. The British Embassy is in constant contact with the local authorities, airlines and other diplomatic missions to explore all possible avenues.
Visas
For a fee, visitors already in-country before 19 March can extend their visa twice without leaving the country. Each extension is for an additional 30 days.
If you have any questions on the validity or expiry of your visa, contact UAE Immigration directly. If youâ€™re living outside the UAE, contact the nearest UAE Embassy for advice.
Further information
The British Embassy is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with advice and the latest available information on options for British nationals wishing to leave the UAE.
