Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Ukraine. The Ukrainian authorities have announced that they have disrupted a number of planned attacks, including in Kyiv. Attacks have mainly been aimed at official Ukrainian targets, but could happen anywhere and could affect western interests and places visited by foreigners.
