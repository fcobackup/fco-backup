Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Zambia. The Zambian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus including requiring individuals entering Zambia from countries affected by coronavirus, including the UK, to enter mandatory quarantine for 14 days. Neighbouring countries have begun closing borders and crossing points. Given the rapidly changing situation in the region we are temporarily withdrawing a limited number of UK staff and their dependents from our High Commission in Lusaka. The High Commission will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Zambia. See Health and Local travel
