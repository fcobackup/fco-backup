The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Malawi based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
From 4am on Saturday 9 January, visitors arriving into the UK who have been in or transited through Malawi in the previous 10 days will not be permitted entry. British and Irish nationals, longer-term visa holders and permanent residents arriving in the UK from Malawi, need to self-isolate on their return. Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel to Malawi is subject to entry restrictions
On 23 December Malawi closed all its land borders to non-residents until further notice.
Malawi airspace remains open to a limited number of commercial flights.
All visitors entering Malawi must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within the 10 days prior to arrival.
If you’re eligible for entry, you may also be tested for COVID-19 on arrival at your own expense. Passengers may be required to remain at the airport or a testing centre until their COVID-19 test results are known, usually within 24 hours. Individuals testing positive may be taken for treatment at a government facility. All other individuals will be required to self-monitor for COVID-19 signs and symptoms for 14 days after arrival.
On exiting Malawi, you must provide a valid “Travel Certificate” showing that a negative COVID-19 test has been taken at a government designated centre within 72 hours of your departure.
Mandatory COVID-19 testing may also take place on departure if you fail to produce a valid negative test certificate, or if the airport staff judge you to display COVID-19 symptoms. This test will be at your own expense.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
