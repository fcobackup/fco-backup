Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Azerbaijan.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Azerbaijan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Azerbaijani Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Azerbaijan.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Azerbaijan as a visitor, your passport must usually have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least 2 blank pages for entry stamps. See ‘visa requirements’ for more details. 
To enter Azerbaijan as a resident, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the expiry date of your temporary or permanent residence permit.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Checks at border control
Anyone who has previously visited areas of Nagorno-Karabakh without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities could be refused entry to Azerbaijan. 
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Azerbaijan.
Applying for a visa
Apply and pay for a visa from the ASAN Visa (e-visa) service. Apply at least 3 days in advance. An urgent 3-hour service is available for an additional fee.
E-visas are normally single entry and allow a 30 day visit within a 90 day period of validity. You must print out the e-visa and bring it with your passport to show on arrival. Officials will check that your passport is valid for 3 months after the visa expiry date. This means your passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the date you arrive in Azerbaijan.
For other types of visa, such as a business visa or a work permit, contact the Azerbaijani Embassy in the UK at least one month before your travel date.
Extending your visa
You can extend your 30 days by applying to the State Migration Service at least 3 days before the end of the permitted stay.
If you overstay your visa without permission, you may have to leave the country within 48 hours. Contact the State Migration Service as soon as possible. They can issue a letter giving you permission to leave. You will have to pay a fine of 300 to 400 Azerbaijani manat. Make sure you get a receipt.
If you are in Azerbaijan, you can also call the Migration Information Centre on 919.
Registering with the authorities
If you’re staying in Azerbaijan for longer than 15 days, you must register with the State Migration Service online or in person. Hotels often provide this service for their guests, but you must do it yourself if you are staying in an apartment or private residence.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Azerbaijan guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Azerbaijan. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. Follow advice from your airline about items you should declare.
If you are bringing a mobile phone or tablet into the country for the first time, you must complete a declaration online and show it to customs officials on arrival. You will need to give the IMEI number of your mobile, which you can find in settings, or by messaging *#06#
If you plan to use a local SIM card for more than 30 days, you must register it and pay a fee at a local post office. If you do not declare your device or register your sim card, they may not work on local networks and your device could be locked.
Exporting carpets and antiques
You need an export certificate to take antiques or art like carpets, samovars, copperware or paintings out of Azerbaijan. Your vendor will give you a certificate, or they are available from the Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum.  
British-Azerbaijani dual nationality
Azerbaijan does not allow people aged 18 or over to hold dual nationality. You may be refused entry, denied departure or even face criminal liability if you’re found to be holding both an Azerbaijani passport and a passport of a different nationality. If you’re a British passport holder with links to Azerbaijan (through birth or otherwise) and wish to check your nationality status, contact the State Migration Service before you travel.
Children aged 17 and under holding a second nationality should not face any difficulties.
