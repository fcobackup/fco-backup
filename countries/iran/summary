The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises British nationals against all travel to Iran.
There is a significantly high risk that British nationals and British-Iranian dual nationals could be arbitrarily arrested, questioned or detained in Iran. There have been a number of British-Iranian dual nationals detained in Iran serving long prison sentences. Iran has also recently detained non-Iranian European nationals travelling on tourist visas. The criminal justice process followed in such cases falls below international standards. In such cases the FCDO’s ability to provide consular support is extremely limited. Having British connections can be reason enough for the authorities to be suspicious of your activities.
Localised protests are currently taking place across Iran. It is difficult to predict where protests will arise. The Iranian authorities have accused inter alia people with links to the UK of inciting protests. If you are near where a protest is taking place, you are at serious risk of arrest. Anyone who is arrested in connection with protests and holds British nationality may come under added suspicion, increasing the risk of lengthy detention and/or criminal charges. The Iranian authorities implement internet restrictions and in some cases internet shutdowns. Mobile data, non-Iranian mobile apps and international calls may not work and should not be relied on for personal safety. In the event that the situation deteriorates suddenly, the ability of the British Embassy to provide assistance to British nationals from within Iran may be limited. You should not assume that the FCDO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country.
See ‘Political situation’ on the ‘Safety and security’ page for more information.
The Iranian authorities do not recognise dual nationality, so if you are a British-Iranian dual national and are detained, the FCDO will not be informed of your detention by the authorities and will not be granted access to see you. Our ability to provide consular assistance will be extremely limited. For British nationals without Iranian dual-nationality, the FCDO may not be informed for some time of your detention and the FCDO may be denied consular welfare visits for long periods of time. See Safety and Security.
If you decide to travel against FCDO advice, you should maintain a low profile and keep up to date with developments, including via this travel advice. Avoid any rallies, marches and processions, keep away from official/military sites and follow the instructions of the local authorities at all times. Iran’s current entry restrictions and requirements may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider. See ‘Entry requirements’ if you are departing Iran and plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Iran. Attacks could happen anywhere, including in places visited by foreigners. On 26 October 2022, 15 people were killed at a shrine in Shiraz, southern Iran, in an attack claimed by the terrorist group Daesh. On 22 September 2018, there was an attack on a military parade in Ahvaz, capital of Khuzestan province. On 7 June 2017, there were two attacks in Tehran – one in the Majles (the Iranian parliament) in central Tehran and another at the Imam Khomeini Shrine near Imam Khomeini international airport. See Terrorism.
Iran is a Muslim country in which Islamic law is strictly enforced. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend. See Local laws and customs
It is possible to exchange GBP in some exchange bureaux, though you may experience difficulties changing money. Euros and US Dollars (USD) are more commonly accepted. See Money
Consular support is very limited in Iran. If you need consular assistance you should contact the British Embassy on telephone: +98 (0)21 6405 2000 to make an appointment. See Consular assistance services.
