COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Liechtenstein.
Passport validity requirements
Liechtenstein follows Schengen area rules. Your passport must:  
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document, or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area, which includes Liechtenstein, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
The requirements for working in Liechtenstein are different.
If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day visa-free limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit. 
If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.
If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period 
To stay longer, you must meet the Liechtenstein government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need (in German).
If you’re in Liechtenstein with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
See passport stamping if you live in Liechtenstein.
