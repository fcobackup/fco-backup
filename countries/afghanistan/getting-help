For refunds or changes to travel, contact your travel provider. You may also be able to make a claim through insurance. However, insurers usually require you to talk to your travel provider first.

Support from FCDO 
There is no British Embassy in Afghanistan and our ability to provide help to British nationals is severely limited and cannot be delivered in person.
FCDO has guidance on staying safe and what to do if you need help or support abroad, including:
getting help if you’re a victim of crime
what to do if you’re in hospital
if you’re affected by a crisis, such as a terrorist attack
For information about applying for a British passport, or to check on your passport application, see overseas British passport applications or call the Passport Adviceline.
