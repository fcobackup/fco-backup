the whole of Sierra Leone based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.

Anyone intending to travel to Sierra Leone must obtain authorisation from the Government of Sierra Leone through their on line portal. This requires the submission of a negative COVID-19 PCR test. Additional COVID-19 testing is conducted on arrival
From Wednesday May 12 2021, the Government of Sierra Leone will implement additional protective measures from countries known to have high SARS-COV-2 transmission, a sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, and/or circulation of variants of concern.
