Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Mauritania.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, who choose to travel despite FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Mauritania’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Mauritania set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Mauritanian Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Mauritania, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
From 5 January 2025, it is no longer possible to obtain a visa on arrival in Mauritania. Before you travel, you must apply for an e-visa online via the website of the Mauritanian National Agency for the Population Register and Secure Titles (Agence Nationale du Registre des Populations et des Titres Sécurisés), who can be contacted via email (contact@anrpts.gov.mr) if you face any technical difficulties with your application.
E-visa fees must be paid on arrival in Mauritania in exact cash in Euros or US dollars. Change and receipts are not given. For information on visa lengths and fees, read guidance on the Mauritanian government’s website (in French).
You should apply for an e-visa well in advance of your anticipated travel date to ensure that it is issued on time by the Mauritanian authorities.
The Mauritanian Embassy in London does not issue visas.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Mauritania, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For more details about health entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, including yellow fever, see TravelHealthPro’s Mauritania guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Mauritania. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
