This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Uganda set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
All arriving passengers are required to provide a negative COVID-19 test certificate issued no more than 72 hours before boarding the aircraft to Uganda or crossing land borders. Foreign nationals without a valid negative test certificate will be denied entry. Children aged three and under are exempt when accompanying parents arrive with a negative test certificate.
The requirement for all travellers to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test on arrival at Entebbe airport was suspended on16 February 2022.
Passengers arriving or departing from Entebbe International Airport can only be picked up or dropped off by a maximum of two people, including the driver, in order to avoid crowding.
Vehicles with more than the authorised number of people will not be allowed access to the airport.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. Some airlines have refused to allow passengers who have used NHS tests to travel. You should arrange to take a private test.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
You are not required to show your COVID-19 vaccination status on arrival in Uganda.
Testing/Screening on arrival
Arriving passengers will be subject to temperature checks and will be screened for infectious diseases by the Port Health authorities. If your temperature is above normal or you display COVID-19 symptoms you may be required to take a COVID-19 test. If a foreign national tests positive for COVID-19 and wishes to be repatriated for treatment outside of Uganda, they will be expected to cover the costs themselves.
Testing / screening on departure
Departing passengers are required to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate, issued no more than 72 hours before travel. The 72 hours begins on the day the sample is collected for testing. Children aged three and under are exempt when accompanying parents have a negative test certificate. Passengers who have received a positive COVID-19 PCR test within 7 days of travel will not be permitted to travel.
COVID-19 tests taken for the purpose of travel outside of Uganda have to be paid for, even if the test is taken at a government testing centre. All COVID-19 test certificates issued in Uganda must indicate the intended purpose of the test. Only test certificates which state travel as the intended purpose will be valid for departure from Uganda. Test certificates which state contact or alert will not be valid for travel.
There are a number of public and private COVID-19 test centres in Uganda. For further information, please see the government COVID-19 Response website.
Departing passengers will be required to wear a face mask inside the terminal and will be subject to temperature checks. Social distancing will also be in place and only passengers with valid tickets and airport officials will be allowed into the terminal building. Passengers are advised to arrive at the airport at least 4 hours before departure.
