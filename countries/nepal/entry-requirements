Entry to Nepal
When inward flights resume, the Government of Nepal may continue to require specific conditions of entry for passengers originating from the UK. Those seeking to enter Nepal were previously required to present certain documentation:
a certificate showing a negative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, taken within 72 hours of flight of first departure or a complete vaccination against COVID-19
a visa or prior approval document
a hotel booking that allows at least ten days’ quarantine in Nepal (if not vaccinated)
a travel insurance document which covers health, immediate crisis, or rescue for the duration of your travel
The Department of Immigration has fuller information.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
