You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

Armenia is a Christian country and women can usually dress in normal western-style clothing. Outside the capital some people can be more conservative and inappropriate dress might attract attention.
Carry a photocopy of your passport as identification at all times.
The use of illegal drugs carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms. The penalty for smuggling drugs carries a prison term of between 4 to 10 years.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in 2003 but is still viewed with disapproval by many Armenians. Local LGBT groups occasionally suffer from verbal and physical harassment. Although same sex couples are often seen holding hands and kissing in public, this is common in Armenian culture, and is not necessarily an indicator of sexual orientation. You should be discreet. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Don’t photograph sites such as military bases, equipment and installations. These are considered sensitive areas and visitors have been detained and questioned while attempting to photograph them.
