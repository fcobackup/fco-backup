Monitor media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities if a storm, forest fire, earthquake, floods or other natural disaster occurs in your area. Check the current weather forecast and warnings at MeteoAlarm.
Storms
All parts of Slovenia can experience extreme storms, including strong winds and rain, lightning, and powerful and large hailstorms.  Such storms can occur suddenly during summer, particularly at times of extreme heat across Europe.  Seek shelter and follow local advice until the storm passes.
Earthquakes
Western Slovenia is on an earthquake fault line and is subject to occasional tremors. You can find information about preparedness on the website of Sloveniaâ€™s Administration for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief.
Forest fires
In summer months, there is an increased risk of forest fires. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland and forest areas. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, do not light barbecues outside of designated areas and do not leave any rubbish, particularly empty bottles behind, as these are known to start fires.
Floods
Flash floods can occur with very little warning and can lead to dangerous water flows and disruption to transport and other networks. You should keep a close eye on weather forecasts and follow the advice of local authorities.
