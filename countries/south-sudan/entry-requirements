This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in South Sudan set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
South Sudan has reopened its land borders but all passengers should check restrictions in place from neighbouring countries.
Coronavirus (COVID-19) certificate
To enter South Sudan, you must have a certificate showing you are free from coronavirus, issued no more than 96hours ahead of your journey, and endorsed by a reputable medical provider. You will also need to self-isolate on arrival, for 10 days without a test or for 7 days with test and release.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The South Sudan Embassy in London remains closed, but visa applications are now available online.
Visas are valid for 1 month. If you wish to stay in South Sudan for longer than 1 month you’ll need to apply for an extension at the Ministry of Interior in Juba (although visas and visa extensions are currently not being issued due to coronavirus (COVID-19) measures now in place). You should also consider whether you require a work permit while in South Sudan. If in doubt you should contact the Ministry of Labour in Juba. You must register with the local police station if you’re in South Sudan for longer than 4 days.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into South Sudan.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Although the World Health Organisation doesn’t specify a certificate requirement, you’re required to provide a certificate of vaccination against yellow fever when you apply for your visa.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for exit from South Sudan.
