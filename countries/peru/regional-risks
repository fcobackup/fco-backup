Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Peru.

This section has safety advice for regions of Peru. It only covers regions where the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice. 
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice. 
States of emergency
States of emergency have been declared in some parts of Peru. You can read a list of the areas with a state of emergency in El Peruano official newspaper (in Spanish). For more information on your destination you can contact Iperu. 
In these areas you may notice an increased security presence. You should:
comply with the instructions of local authorities
avoid crowds
monitor the situation closely
Amazon River
There have been cases of criminal activity along the Amazon River. Thieves, known locally as ‘river pirates’, can be armed. Solo travellers and foreign nationals have been targeted when travelling on the Amazon River. Travel with a reputable commercial or travel company if you are visiting the Amazon River. See the advice below about disembarking along the Amazon River that passes through the Peru-Colombia border area.
Border areas
Peru-Colombia border
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to areas within 20km south of the Putumayo River and border between Peru and Colombia except for: 
the Amazon River
the area of the triple border with Brazil and Colombia from and including the towns of Caballococha in Peru up to the actual triple border at Santa Rosa de Yavari town
This is due to a high level of gang-related violence linked to the presence of organised crime related to the production and trafficking of illegal drugs.  
If travelling on the Amazon River, be aware that the river is used by armed organised criminal gangs to transport and smuggle illegal drugs. There is little assistance available in this area from the Peruvian authorities, and any assistance available from the British Embassy is severely limited. You should stay on your boat where it passes through areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel.
Peru-Ecuador border
The Peruvian Government has taken preventive measures in Northern Peru in response to the security situation in Ecuador. You may notice an increased security presence.
If you are travelling to Northern Peru or you plan to cross land border checkpoints, ensure you follow the advice of local authorities.
If you wish to enter Ecuador via a land border from Peru, you are required by the Ecuadorean authorities to provide certain documentation. Read the travel advice for Ecuador.
Only cross the Peru-Ecuador land border at official checkpoints. Other parts of the border may still have unexploded landmines. Some tourists have been robbed by fake taxi drivers. Be extremely vigilant in these areas.
The British Embassy may have difficulty in providing in-person emergency or consular support in these areas. While we will work with local authorities to request help, their ability to respond may also be very limited.
Valley of the Apurímac, Ene and Mantaro rivers (VRAEM)
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the Valley of the Apurímac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers, also known as the VRAEM region.
Remnants of the Shining Path far-left political party and guerilla group continue to carry out occasional ambushes and attacks in this area, mainly targeting the police, military forces and local authorities. Tourists are not usually targeted; however, you could be a victim of violence due to mistaken identity or by getting caught up in a security incident involving others.
It is difficult for the British Embassy to provide in-person emergency or consular support in these areas. The local authorities may also be very limited in the help they can provide.
Inca trail
There is a government fee and restrictions on numbers of guided groups to protect the Inca trail. During the high season from June to August, make reservations with a travel agency well in advance. 
Only basic medical services are available at Machu Picchu. Several climbers have died or suffered serious injuries after falling while climbing Huayna Picchu, a peak near Machu Picchu. 
You should:
always register when entering national parks
be particularly careful in steep and slippery areas, or those that are unfenced or unmarked
The ‘Inca Jungle Trail’ can be difficult for vehicles due to poor road conditions. There have been fatal road accidents.
Lake Titicaca
Armed robbers have attacked travellers walking on their own. You should:
always take care
contact the local tourist information centre for advice about known safe zones
travel with a group at the southern end of Lake Titicaca, if walking at night
Nazca Lines
If you are planning to fly over the Nazca Lines, check the airline company is licensed and has a good safety record before you book. There have been several fatal accidents in recent years.
You can ask the iPeru information service for advice about booking flights.
Putumayo River
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to areas within 20km south of the Putumayo River which runs along much of Peru’s border with Colombia. The advice against all but essential travel applies to the Peruvian side of the Putumayo riverbank, though not on the river itself. If you are planning to disembark on the Colombian side of the Putumayo riverbank, you should check FCDO travel advice for Colombia.
The Putumayo River forms most of Peru’s border with Colombia. It is an area known for intensive cocaine and marijuana production. Drug trafficking and other violent organised crime takes place on, and in the area around, the river.
