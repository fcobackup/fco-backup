The Cuban government intends to reform the dual currency system to just one currency. A date for this change has not been set.
Visitors usually use the Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC), whereas locals use the Cuban Peso (CUP). Some shops will only give change in CUP. One CUP is worth less than one CUC. US dollars aren’t accepted as legal tender; you’ll be charged 10% commission to exchange them. Scottish and Irish bank notes cannot be exchanged.
You should not take CUC out of the country. Allow plenty of time to change any remaining CUC at the airport. You will need to show your boarding pass to change CUC. There may be limited currency available at that time so you may not be able to change all CUC you have. You should exchange CUC before you pass through immigration. CUC is not accepted in duty free shops or cafes in the departure area after immigration. It is recommended to have Euros, US or Canadian dollars for cash payments there.
Don’t change money anywhere other than at Cadeca exchange houses, large hotels or banks, due to the prevalence of forged currency. Always check transactions carefully. Where possible ask for small denomination bills. Ignore individuals offering exchange facilities to avoid queues.
Check with your bank before you travel to confirm that your debit, credit and ATM cards will work in Cuba. If your bank can’t confirm this then you should bring sterling or euros in cash, or travellers cheques. Bank notes should be in good condition with no tears, rips or markings.
Travellers cheques and credit cards drawn on American banks aren’t widely accepted. There are virtually no ATMs available for drawing cash against Cirrus or Switch cards. Credit card transactions, including withdrawals from ATMs, are subject to local commission charges of approximately 3% in addition to your bank transaction charges.
