International travel
A limited schedule of international flights, including to the UK, has resumed. The Royal Oman Police have resumed issuing visas, including ‘tourist’ eVisas.
British nationals over the age of 16, you must:
take a PCR test no more than 72 hours before arrival in Oman;
complete an online pre-registration form;
have proof of hotel accommodation and travel/health insurance which covers at least 30 days of COVID-19 treatment;
take a PCR test on landing; and
complete 7 days self-isolation.
Self-isolation must be completed at any hotel in Oman at your own expense. Exceptions are in place if you are under 18 years of age (and unaccompanied), over 60 years of age or have a document from your health provider stating that for medical reasons you cannot self-isolate in a hotel. In these circumstances you must self-isolate at home for 7 days.
If you are a British national over the age of 16, a further PCR test must be taken on day 8. If this is negative, there is no need to continue self-isolating.
You should stay in touch with your airline, hotel and monitor local media.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Oman
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Omani Ministry of Health has identified priority target groups for the COVID-19 vaccine. If you are a British national resident in Oman and fit within a priority group, please approach one of the authorised health centres: Seeb Specialised Polyclinic, Bausher Specialised Polyclinic or Quriyat Polyclinic for details on how to get vaccinated. If you are uncertain if you are eligible, please speak to your medical provider and/or call the Ministry of Health hotline on 1212.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information.
