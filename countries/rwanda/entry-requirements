This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Rwanda’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Rwanda set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Rwandan High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Rwanda.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Rwanda, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and at least one blank page for entry stamps.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to enter Rwanda as a visitor. As a citizen of a Commonwealth country, you can get a free 30-day visa on arrival.
Rwanda’s immigration department has information on visa requirements.
Applying for a visa
You can also apply for a visa from the Rwandan High Commission in London.
You must get a UK Police Certificate before you travel if you’re applying for a resident, business or missionary multiple-entry visa. It usually takes at least 10 working days to process.
Travel between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
Check land border crossing opening hours before you travel between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo at Gisenyi-Goma and Cyangugu-Bukavu, as they vary.
You may experience immigration difficulties if you do not have residency status and regularly cross between the 2 countries.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Rwanda, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.

Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Rwanda. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
You must declare drones when you arrive. They may be confiscated or held until you leave the country.
Leaving Rwanda - Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) screening
All travellers departing Rwanda are asked to complete a symptom-screening questionnaire within 24 hours in advance of exiting the country, available via a QR code at Kigali international airport. Alternatively, passengers can complete the declaration form available on the Rwandair website and present this on departure.
Travellers through the airport should expect routine temperature checks using thermo-scan cameras and to use hand sanitising stations where available.
