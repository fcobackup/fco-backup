The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
The whole of Morocco based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Morocco is subject to entry restrictions
With effect from midnight on 20 December, the Moroccan Government suspended until further notice all direct flights between Morocco and the UK following the emergence of a new strain of COVID-19 in the UK. Passengers arriving in Morocco by air, travelling from the UK via a third country are also not allowed to enter Morocco. British nationals who were planning to travel between the two countries should contact their airlines, ferry and/or tour operators for further information
If you’re eligible to enter (once current entry restrictions have been lifted), you will have to provide a negative PCR test result before boarding your flight or ferry to Morocco The result must show that the PCR test itself was undertaken less than 72 hours before the time of departure
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
