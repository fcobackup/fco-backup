Quarantine requirements
From 30 May 2021, the Slovenian authorities have implemented a Dark Red list. This is in addition to the Red, Amber and Green list, to determine the requirements for people arriving into Slovenia from overseas. From 30 May 2021, the UK is on the Dark Red list. The rules around entry are detailed, and subject to regular change. You should regularly consult this Travel Advice and the Slovenian Government websites listed below to ensure you have the latest information. Full details can be found on this Slovenian Government website, including up-to-date information on which country is on which list. You should consult this website regularly.
From 10 July 2021, passengers arriving from a country which is on Slovenia’s Dark Red List, which includes the UK, will only be able to enter the country if they hold permanent or temporary residence in Slovenia. Full details can be found on the Slovenian Government’s website.
Anyone travelling to Slovenia from a Dark Red List country who does not hold permanent or temporary residence in Slovenia will not be permitted entry, unless they meet one of the 14 exemptions
People arriving into Slovenia from a Dark Red List country who have permanent or temporary residence will be required to quarantine at home for 10 days unless they can present a certificate of recovery, a certificate of vaccination or a certificate of vaccination for a recovered person. Certificates of recovery or vaccination that are part of a digital certificate will also be accepted. Both EU and third country vaccination and recovery certificates are accepted, including from the UK. If Slovene residents are required to quarantine, this quarantine can be ended after 5 days, on receipt of a negative PCR test.
If you are travelling to Slovenia from the UK on an indirect route via another country, you may be deemed to be entering from a Dark Red List country unless you can prove to have spent at least 5 days in a country that is listed as either Green or Amber.
The 14 exemptions also apply to people entering Slovenia from Green, Amber and Red List countries.
For details of entry requirements for people travelling to Slovenia from a country on the Green or Amber List country, please see requirements here.
PCR tests and Rapid Antigen Tests conducted in the UK are accepted by the Slovenian authorities.
If your travel is deemed by the Slovenian authorities to be non-essential, then you may be denied entry by the Slovenian authorities, even if you have a negative PCR test which was conducted in an EU/Schengen country.
Anyone required to enter into quarantine will need to provide an address (where they will be staying) to the Border authorities. Failure to do so may result in the Border authorities denying you entry into Slovenia. During self-isolation, you are required to stay in your accommodation and not socialise outside of your household. You can take short walks for exercise, but should maintain social distancing and not engage with people from outside your household. The local municipality can make arrangements for the delivery of essential supplies if friends or family cannot support you.
All arriving travellers will be given advice at the border regarding the steps they may need to take.
Internal checkpoints on the Schengen borders with Italy, Austria and Hungary have been removed.
If you are travelling to neighbouring countries you should check the travel advice for the latest information on entering those countries. See travel advice for Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Italy. If you remain in Slovenia, you should be aware that for stays longer than 90 days, you will be required to register as a Temporary Resident.

Regular entry requirements
Visas  
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Slovenia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Slovenian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Slovene Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, you may need
if you stay in Slovenia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Slovenia or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Slovenian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Slovenia. If you are resident in Slovenia, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Slovenia guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovenia.
