The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.

Coronavirus
Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in South Africa. The South African authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Visitors from a number of countries affected by coronavirus, including the United Kingdom, will not be permitted to enter South Africa from 18 March 2020.
The United States, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom are considered high risk countries for coronavirus. Travellers who have visited these countries in the last 20 days will be denied permission to enter the country. Visitors from these countries who have entered South Africa will have their visas revoked.
Travellers from medium-risk countries, including Portugal, Hong Kong and Singapore will be required to undergo high intensity screening.
Visiting foreigners from high-risk countries (including the UK) who have entered the country since mid-February will be required to present themselves for testing.
All ‘non-essential domestic travel’ is discouraged.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact local immigration authorities or the nearest South African High Commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
The South African authorities have published coronavirus advice here Screening processes have been introduced at all major ports of entry, including airports. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. If port health officials believe you should be tested for coronavirus, you will be taken to a nearby hospital designated for receiving and testing suspected cases. If tested positive, you may be placed into quarantine or asked to self-isolate depending on your circumstances. If quarantine or further treatment is required, you should contact your insurer, and speak to health officials, to understand where the quarantine or treatment should take place see local medical care

Other health risks
According to the 2018 UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic South Africa has the biggest HIV epidemic in the world, with 7.1 million people living with HIV. HIV prevalence is high among the general population at 18.9%. You should exercise normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS. There is no reciprocal health care agreement between the United Kingdom and South Africa.
Local medical care
South Africa has a very high standard of private medical care, comparable with the UK. Private health care can be expensive, so make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of medical treatment abroad, and repatriation.
Public medical care varies across South Africa, and standards of treatment and hygiene may not be the same as you would expect in the UK.
Private rehabilitation centres are widely accessible to foreigners visiting South Africa. The British High Commission does not usually contact or visit people who have travelled specifically for medical treatment. Further information on medical tourism is available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre. If you do choose to attend a rehabilitation centre in South Africa, you should:
do extensive research in advance, ensuring you choose a reputable facility.
ensure you have the appropriate visa for your stay.
take out comprehensive travel insurance, which includes medical cover suitable for a rehab stay and your particular circumstances.
Substance use abroad can increase your vulnerability; and although travel does not cause substance dependence, it can provide an opportunity to misuse substances or cause relapse in addiction survivors. More information on the impact of travel and substance use is available on the website of the International Association for Medical Assistance to Travellers
Make sure to organise a contingency plan to cover what will happen if you relapse abroad, if the treatment plan is unsuccessful and/or you require unplanned repatriation to the UK (this plan may need to include additional availability of funds).
