Healthcare in El Salvador
Medical facilities outside San Salvador are usually basic. State-run hospitals are generally understaffed, underfunded and ill-equipped. Use private clinics and hospitals whenever possible. Some hospitals may be reluctant to treat you until they know you have medical insurance.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. Always carry a copy of your insurance cover. Most medical staff speak only a little English.
