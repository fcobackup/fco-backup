There are currently no regularly scheduled commercial options available to return to the UK from Morocco.
If you cannot leave Morocco at this time, see advice on staying in Morocco during coronavirus.
Flights
The British Embassy operated 58 special commercial flights to 6 June to help British travellers return to the UK. No further UK special flights are planned due to lack of demand.
If you are normally resident in the UK and wish to add your name to a waiting list we will work with other embassies to offer you the option to purchase a ticket to a European destination if there is availability. To be added to our waiting list, please email morocco.britishsupport@fco.gov.uk stating clearly that this is what you’d like us to do and providing the following details:
full name as it appears in your passport
British passport number
other nationality (if applicable) and passport number
date of birth
place of birth
UK residency number (if applicable)
contact telephone number (including country code)
location in Morocco
other relevant information, eg important health condition
If you have already registered your details with the British Embassy, do not send another email. You will be contacted shortly.
Future options
This travel advice will be updated with information on departure options that become available. Sign up for email alerts and follow the British Embassy Rabat on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, please email the British Embassy in Rabat at morocco.britishsupport@fco.gov.uk.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
