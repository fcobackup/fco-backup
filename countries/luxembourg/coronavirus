Other measures
The Luxembourg Government has announced its exit strategy (in English), which outlines the resumption of activities in successive phases.
The first phase, which will last for three weeks, permits construction and gardening/landscaping to restart, and recycling centres and DIY shops to reopen.
Schools will open in three waves from 4 May, starting with senior classes, internships and those who have practical studies at college or university.
The second phase will begin on 11 May with the resumption of secondary schools.
The third phase will begin on 25 May with the opening of primary schools, crèches and childcare facilities.
Restaurants, bars and other non-essential commercial establishments will remain closed.
Gatherings will remain prohibited until 31 July, with the exception of funerals, civil weddings with a maximum of 20 people and where the 2-metre social distancing requirement can be respected. Restrictions on social activity and non-essential movement outside the home remain in force.
Face masks
It is mandatory to wear a mask (or anything else covering the mouth and nose, such as a scarf), to be worn in situations where the social distancing requirement cannot be met e.g. supermarkets and on public transport.
