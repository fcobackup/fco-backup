The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Belgium based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
The Belgian Government has announced that from 1 January 2021 UK nationals resident in the UK or outside of the EU will not be permitted entry to Belgium for non-essential purposes due to the EU-wide COVID-19 restrictions. Essential travel is still permitted; those travelling to Belgium should have proof that their journey is essential. These restrictions do not apply to UK nationals who are resident in Belgium, who should be prepared to show valid proof of residence to enter Belgium.
All non-residents aged 12 years and over who plan to stay in Belgium for more than 48 hours will need to provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test upon entry.
All travellers from the UK, including those resident in Belgium, must complete the Belgian Passenger Locator Form before travel. Travellers who have not completed the form before travelling may be refused entry and/or face a fine.
Please see Entry Requirements for further information.
