The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Hungary
Hungary has restricted entry to foreign nationals. Entry rules may change at short notice. You can find the latest announcements on the Hungarian government website (in English).
UK Nationals who possess a valid residence permit (of longer than 90 days) are allowed to enter Hungary. On entering you will have to undergo a medical examination for COVID-19 and will need to self-isolate for 14 days. You can be exempted from the requirement to self-isolate if you have two negative test results, for SARS-CoV-2, from tests taken within five days of your entry date. The results must be proven in an official document presented in either Hungarian or in English.
Other UK nationals who wish to enter Hungary must submit an application for exemption on the official website of the Hungarian Police by completing an electronic form here. The form is currently only available in Hungarian and must be completed in Hungarian. The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade recommend that applications are submitted several days in advance of planned travel, clearly stating the justification for the exemption application. The form sets out in more details about the type of exceptional circumstances in which the authorities may allow entry.
UK nationals who are family members of EEA citizens do not need to pre-register and can enter Hungary without restrictions. You must prove your relationship to these family members in an official document.
All foreign nationals transiting through Hungary must undergo a medical examination at the border and show no symptoms of COVID-19. You must be able to prove what your destination is, the reason you are travelling and that you are able to transit to your final destination. Throughout the transit you can only use specified routes, dedicated petrol and rest stations and specific border crossing points.
Testing / screening on arrival
Anyone entering Hungary following this application route will undergo a medical check.
If you show no symptoms of COVID-19 on arrival, you still need to follow a 14-day quarantine rule. If you show signs of COVID-19, entry will be rejected.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Hungary. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Hungary guide and contact the Hungarian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Hungary.
Fines
Entry into Hungary can be barred if you have failed to pay a previous fine in Hungary. Contact the Hungarian Embassy in London for guidance on paying any outstanding fines before you next enter Hungary.
Customs regulations
Community regulations ensure the free movement of goods between EU member states. This means that no customs procedures are required for exporting goods from Hungary to another EU member state and/or for importing goods from a member state to Hungary. The export and import of goods purchased for non-commercial purposes (for personal use or as gifts) while travelling is not restricted, however, the transport of certain goods (such as: pets, hunting weapons, alcohol and tobacco products, medicines containing drugs, etc.) within the European Union is restricted or subject to special permissions.
Check the customs regulations before entering or leaving Hungary on the National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary website.
