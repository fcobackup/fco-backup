US Embassy alert 6 September 
On 6 September, the United States Embassy in Dushanbe issued a travel advisory which says “Independence Day celebrations will take place over the extended holiday weekend. Tajik authorities maintain a high level of security to thwart terrorist attacks.  This could lead terrorists to seek softer targets including facilities where U.S. citizens and other foreigners congregate such as residential areas; clubs and restaurants; markets; places of worship; schools; hotels; outdoor recreational events, including popular hiking areas; and resorts.  U.S. citizens should avoid predictable patterns of movement and revealing their personal information and location on social media.  If using social media, ensure your privacy settings are appropriately set.”
