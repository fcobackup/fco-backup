All travellers
All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Anguilla before travel.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you are 18 years and older, you must present evidence on arrival that you are fully vaccinated with an approved vaccine and that you received your last vaccination at least 14 days before arrival. Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated on the Anguilla Tourist Board web page.
Additionally, you must provide acceptable evidence of a negative COVID-19 test (NAA/PCR/RNA test taken no more than 72 hours before entry) or Rapid Antigen (taken no more than 48 hours before entry). See information on the Anguilla Tourist Board web page about taking a test before travelling.
The tests must be administered by an accredited health professional and processed at an accredited laboratory. Self-administered home tests and antibody tests will not be accepted.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
If you arrive in Anguilla without the appropriate documentation (proof of vaccination and test results), you will be required to return to your country of origin. If that is not possible, you will complete arrival and exit tests, and quarantine for 5 days at your own expense. You will also be charged US$200 by the Government of Anguilla in addition to any fines for unapproved entry.
