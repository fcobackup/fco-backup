Cash is the main means of paying for goods and services in Comoros. The Banque International du Comore (BIC - affiliated to BNP) is the only established bank on Grande Comore, and banking facilities are minimal to non-existent on the other islands. The two cash machines found at the BIC and the Itsandra Hotel work occasionally.
You can withdraw cash (local currency only) against a credit card from a small Bureau de Change office attached to the main BIC branch (on left hand side of main entrance).
Only one or two hotels accept credit cards for payment of bills (this can sometimes be problematic due to technical / connection problems with the equipment), but will not provide local currency against credit cards. Some hotels and restaurants will accept some foreign currencies (Euros and US Dollars preferred). Change may be given in local currency.
