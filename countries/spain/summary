Temperatures regularly reach over 40ºC in Spain during the summer months. These temperatures bring an increased risk of forest fires. Make sure cigarettes are properly extinguished and don’t leave empty bottles behind in woodland areas. Causing a forest fire is treated as a criminal offence in Spain even if unintentional. There are strict regulations across much of Spain against lighting outdoor barbecues in forest areas and penalties imposed include heavy fines. You should be aware that some regions prohibit the use of outdoor barbecues in public picnic areas during the summer months. Check on the outbreak of fires with the local civil protection authority and report any you see immediately to the emergency services on 112. See Natural disasters
