Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Thailand.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Thailand set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Thai Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Thailand, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and have at least 1 blank page.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Dual nationals
If you’re a dual national, it is best to leave Thailand on the same passport you used to enter – this will avoid problems at immigration.
Visa requirements
You can visit Thailand for a period of 60 days for the purpose of tourism, business engagements, and urgent or ad-hoc work. This visa category can be extended for another period not exceeding 30 days.
You can also apply in advance for a multiple-entry visa for up to 60 days.
For work, study or other reasons, you need a visa before you travel.      
Digital Arrival Card 
From 1 May 2025, all foreign nationals entering Thailand, whether by air, land or sea must complete a digital arrival card online before arrival. Travellers can register for an arrival card within 3 days before they arrive.
Overstaying your visa
If you overstay the period of your visa, you will get a fine of 500 Thai baht a day up to a maximum of 20,000 baht. You risk being:
held in detention
deported at your own expense
banned from re-entering Thailand for up to 10 years
Conditions in detention centres can be harsh.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Thailand, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Thailand guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Thailand. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking cigarettes into Thailand
It is illegal to take more than 200 cigarettes per person into Thailand. This is enforced at customs on arrival. If you go over the limit, you could be fined 10 times the value. Your cigarettes will likely be confiscated.
