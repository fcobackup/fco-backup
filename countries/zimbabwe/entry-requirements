This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Zimbabwe’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Zimbabwe set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Zimbabwean Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Zimbabwe.
You may be asked to complete an arrival form, including the addresses of where you are staying. 
Travel within Zimbabwe
Officially, some COVID-19 measures remain in place, including a curfew between midnight and 5.30am, but they are rarely enforced.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Zimbabwe, your passport must:
be valid for at least 6 months from the date of your arrival
have 3 blank pages, in case you need to enter Zimbabwe and exit through one of the neighbouring countries or if you need to leave at short notice
Check with your travel provider that your passport and any other travel documents meet their requirements. Renew your passport if you need to. 
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Zimbabwe.
Applying for a visa
Most visitors apply for a visa on arrival in Zimbabwe. Take enough US dollars with you in small notes to pay for your visa – see information on visa fees from the Zimbabwean Embassy.
You can also apply for an e-visa before you travel.
It is no longer possible to get a visa from the Zimbabwean Embassy in London.
Zimbabwe usually grants 30-day visas. Check the number of days on your visa covers your intended period of stay.
To extend or renew visas or permits, go in person to the Government of Zimbabwe Immigration Department. 
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Zimbabwe government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Official Government of Zimbabwe web portal. 
You must have a temporary work permit if you’re volunteering or doing missionary work.
Zimbabwean temporary travel documents
Zimbabwean temporary travel documents (TTDs) are not valid for re-entry to the UK. You could be stranded in Zimbabwe if you travel using this document.
KAZA Univisa
The KAZA Univisa is valid for travel between Zimbabwe and Zambia and day trips into Botswana. It’s available at Harare, Bulawayo and Victoria Falls airports and at the land borders at Victoria Falls (Zambian border) and Kazungula (Botswana border). It costs 50 US dollars and is valid for 30 days.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Zimbabwe, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Zimbabwe guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that you can take into or out of Zimbabwe. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Arms embargo
There is a UK arms embargo against Zimbabwe. It is an offence in UK law to take firearms into Zimbabwe, even if you plan to bring them back to the UK.
Gemstones
Do not carry any precious or semi-precious stones without the correct paperwork.
Taking money into and out of Zimbabwe
It is illegal to leave Zimbabwe with more than 10,000 US dollars cash (or the same amount in other currencies), unless it is left over from funds you brought with you and declared on arrival. Keep the proof of declaration to avoid problems with officials when you leave.
Journalists
If you’re working as a journalist (for example, as a reporter or news photographer), you must get accreditation before you travel from the Zimbabwean Embassy in the UK. If you do not have proper accreditation, you are at risk of arrest, detention in difficult conditions, a fine and deportation.
The Zimbabwe government uses a broad definition of journalism. This may include any form of interview, filming or photography. Consider carefully the risks associated with engaging in social media activities such as posting comments, blogging or sharing photographs, which can be seen as journalism.
