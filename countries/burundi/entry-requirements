Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Burundi
Commercial flights to Burundi are now operating at a reduced capacity. Please check with carriers for more information. Land borders reopened from 1 August, although there have been difficulties reported in land border crossings.
All travellers to Burundi must have proof of a negative COVID-19 test issued in the last 72 hours. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Visitors to Burundi must get a visa before travel, via any Burundian diplomatic mission.
Quarantine requirements
All travellers to Burundi must have proof of a negative COVID-19 test issued in the last 72 hours. All travellers must then spend up to 72 hours in a pre-booked, government-approved hotel while awaiting the results of a COVID-19 test taken on arrival in Burundi at the airport. This costs US $100 which will need to be paid in cash on arrival at Bujumbura international airport. If any passenger on your flight tests positive, all passengers from that flight will be placed into quarantine for 14 days.
