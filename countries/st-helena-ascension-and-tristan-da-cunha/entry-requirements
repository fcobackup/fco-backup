Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha
All foreign nationals are permitted to enter St Helena provided they meet the immigration rules. There are no other entry restrictions in force apart from the requirement for compulsory quarantine for 14 days (see below).
All travellers to Ascension Island require an entry permit visa unless exempted by their occupation, such as active members of Her Majesty’s Armed Forces. Failure to enter with a valid visa is an offence under the Entry Control (Ascension) Ordinance and may result in a fine and imprisonment. Individuals may also be refused permission to land and be required to leave on the aircraft or vessel that they arrived on. Applicants should be aware that their applications may be affected by a change in the Ascension COVID-19 Response Level, particularly if this reflects an escalation of the seriousness of the COVID-19 threat on the island. During such circumstances permissions for certain types of entry permits may not be granted, and extant permissions may be revoked.
All arrivals that have travelled from a COVID-19 infected area within the last 14 days, or travelled with others who have been in an infected area in the last 14 days, are subject to isolation restrictions for 14 days following their arrival at Ascension. During this time their conditions are monitored for the development of symptoms which may be considered consistent with COVID-19. Air crews are also required to isolate for the duration of their stay on island.
Countries currently defined as being an infected area are listed here.
During compulsory isolation, you will not be allowed to leave your accommodation unless directed to by local authorities or unless in an emergency. You will receive a daily welfare check from the local police detachment.
All visitors to Tristan da Cunha require the authority of the Island Council in advance.
