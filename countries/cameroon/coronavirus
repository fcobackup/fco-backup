Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public places and services
Restrictions on bars, restaurants and entertainment spots have been lifted.
The wearing of face-masks has almost entirely been dropped, including in public buildings. However, you should carry one on you in case needed.
Healthcare in Cameroon
Pharmacies have a green cross on a panel. Most are extremely helpful to clients. Pharmacies in Cameroon tend to accept prescriptions drawn up in the UK. Not all pharmacies have full stocks so you should be prepared to have to visit more than one for some drugs – a pharmacy will usually advise you on other possibilities nearby. Most supermarkets do not have a pharmacy inside. If you are hospitalised in Cameroon and need drugs of any kind, you, or an accompanying person, will have to visit a pharmacy (usually in the hospital) to buy the drugs first and then return to the ward before you can be treated. Not all pharmacies are open after 8pm. Pharmacies on call will usually have a display sign on the windows or doors. If not on call, the pharmacy will carry information on the nearest pharmacy on call. View Health for further details on healthcare in Cameroon.
