Money
Bring US dollars in cash or travellers’ cheques.
The limited banking system in Timor-Leste will not exchange Pounds Sterling cash or Sterling travellers’ cheques. The same often applies to Euros. Credit cards are not always accepted outside of major hotels. In Dili, ATMs are limited, in districts, ATMs, banks or credit cards facilities are not available. Bring small notes when travelling in districts as large denominations are hard to change.
