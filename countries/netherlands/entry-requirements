The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the Embassy, High Commission or Consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to the Netherlands
The Netherlands has reopened its borders for travel to and from some countries.
International arrivals from outside the EU, UK and the four non-EU Schengen countries remain subject to entry checks to prevent non-essential travel. There are some exempted countries, which can be found on the Government of the Netherlands website. UK and EU nationals will be able to enter the Netherlands from outside the EU, the four other Schengen countries or the UK but will be required to self-isolate for 10 days. Further information on travelling to the Netherlands from abroad is available from the Government of the Netherlands.
If you are travelling via Belgium or France, check FCDO Travel Advice for those countries.
Quarantine requirements
The Dutch Government has a colour-coded system of high-risk (orange) and lower risk (yellow) countries and regions. Travellers entering the Netherlands from high-risk (orange) regions or countries are required to self-isolate for 10 days upon arrival, unless stated otherwise in the Dutch travel advice.
Travellers to the Netherlands from the UK will not be advised to self-isolate upon arrival in the Netherlands.
Check the Dutch Government’s list of countries/ regions for which self-isolation requirements are in place for the latest information.
Testing/ screening on arrival
If you’re travelling to or from the Netherlands by air you must complete a health screening form and have it ready to show on request during your journey, whether you are at the departure airport, on the aircraft or at the arrival airport. This form is not required if travelling to the Netherlands by road or ferry.
You may be refused permission to travel based on your declaration.
On arrival in the Netherlands your declaration will be checked by public health and security authorities.
On arrival at Amsterdam Schiphol airport, passengers from high-risk (orange) countries/ regions will be able to take a coronavirus test. This is not compulsory. Passengers who take a test at the airport are strongly advised to self-isolate and will be tested again after seven days. Passengers who do not take a test on arrival at the airport are strongly advised to self-isolate for 10 days upon arrival. It is expected that this system will be rolled out to other airports in the Netherlands shortly.
Data collection
Local health authorities may use passenger data to carry out contact tracing for passengers arriving from high-risk (orange) countries.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter the Netherlands. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in the Netherlands guide and contact the Netherlands Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Before you travel, make sure your passport is in good condition. The Netherlands authorities often impound damaged passports and some travellers have had to get an emergency travel document to leave the country.
Travelling with children
Dutch border authorities have strengthened their precautions against child abduction. Parents (particularly fathers) travelling in sole charge of their children are regularly stopped for further checks at Schiphol airport and occasionally prevented from boarding flights.
You should carry a signed authorisation form for travelling abroad with a minor and associated documents (outlined in the above link). See also Get permission to take a child abroad.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from The Netherlands
Moving to the Netherlands
If you intend to live in the Netherlands, you should get important documents (birth certificate and marriage certificates) officially certified (apostilled) at the FCDO Legalisation Office.
