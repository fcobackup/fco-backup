This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Turkey set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Turkey
All arrivals into Turkey, except Turkish citizens or residence permit holders, must complete an online form within 72 hours of travel. This is not required for those passengers transiting Turkey en route to another country.
Passengers arriving from UK, Iran, Egypt or Singapore will require a negative PCR test taken within the 72 hours prior to arriving in Turkey. This is not required for those passengers transiting Turkey en route to another country.
Passengers from Bangladesh, Brazil, South Africa, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka are banned from entering Turkey until further notice. But passengers travelling from these countries may transit without entering Turkey. Passengers who are arriving in Turkey from another country but have been in Bangladesh, Brazil, South Africa, India, Nepal or Sri Lanka in the last 14 days, must submit a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival and must be quarantined for 14 days in government-run quarantine. If the PCR test taken on the 14th day is negative, the passenger is able to leave quarantine. If it is positive they will need to isolate for a further 14 days in the facilities. Turkey’s international land and sea borders are open. However, short-notice changes, especially temporary closures of land borders, are possible and you should check access locally.
International passengers wishing to transit through airports in Turkey on to a domestic Turkish flight will not be required to submit an HES code, unless the passenger is a Turkish citizen or resident of Turkey and the duration between the two flights exceeds 12 hours.
You must wear a face mask at all times whilst in an airport, and for the duration of all flights, to and from Turkey.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizens travelling to Turkey for tourist or business purposes are able to travel without a visa for visits of up to 90 days in any 180-day period.
If you plan to remain in Turkey for a period of more than 90 days, you should either apply for a longer stay visa before you travel, or get a residence permit from the local authorities in Turkey before your 90 day stay has elapsed. If you intend to work in Turkey, ensure you have the correct permits. More information is available from the Turkish Ministry of the Interior. If you do not abide by the terms of your visa or permit, you may be fined, deported and banned from re-entering the country.
If you’re entering Turkey via a land border crossing, make sure your passport has a dated entry stamp before you leave the border crossing area.
If you hold a different type of British nationality (eg BN(O), British Overseas Citizen, British Protected Person or British Subject), check visa requirements with the Turkish Consulate General before you travel. These types of passport are classed as ‘UK Special Passports’ in the Turkish e-Visa system. You will need to apply for a visa from the Turkish Consulate General before you travel.
Passport validity
The Turkish government advise that your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from the date you enter Turkey and that there is a full blank page for the entry and exit stamps. You can find more detail about the requirements for entry into Turkey on the website of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

If you are leaving Turkey with a child who is a dual British-Turkish national, you may be asked to show the Turkish immigration authorities evidence that the Turkish parent has given permission for the child to travel.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Turkey within the dates printed on the document. ETDs should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Turkey.
