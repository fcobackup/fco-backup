This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Sweden set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Swedish Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Sweden.
Accompanied under-18s
Carry a letter of consent from the parent or guardian of children under 18 who are travelling with you.
Passport validity requirements
To travel to Sweden, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
To enter Sweden (and all Schengen countries) your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Checks at border control
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
If you’re a visitor, your passport must be stamped when you enter or leave the Schengen area (which includes Sweden). Border guards will use passport stamps to check you haven’t overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for stays in the Schengen area. If your passport was not stamped, border guards will presume you have overstayed the visa-free limit.
If your passport was not stamped, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
If you live in Sweden, read our Living in Sweden guide for passport stamping information.
At Swedish border control, you may also need to:
show proof of your accommodation
show proof of your travel insurance
show a return or onward ticket
prove that you have enough money for your stay
Border controls on arrival from Denmark and Germany
Border controls are in place in Sweden for people travelling from Denmark via the Öresund crossing and arriving on ferries from Denmark and Germany.
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area (which includes Sweden) for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports event
for short-term studies or training
If you’re travelling to Sweden and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Swedish government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Swedish Embassy in the UK.
If you stay in Sweden with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and vaccination certificates you may need in TravelHealthPro’s Sweden guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Sweden. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking food and drink into the EU
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions for medical reasons, for example certain amounts of powdered infant milk, infant food, or pet food. Check the rules about taking food and drink into the EU on the European Commission website.
Taking money into Sweden
Many shops, cafes and restaurants do not accept cash, so make sure you have a debit or credit card with you.
