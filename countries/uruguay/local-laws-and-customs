Smoking or use of electronic cigarettes is not permitted inside public places.
Uruguay has legalised the sale of marijuana by registered pharmacies for recreational use. However, this is only available to Uruguayan nationals or legal residents in possession of a licence. Tourists arenâ€™t allowed to buy marijuana from these pharmacies.
Uruguay was the first South American country to recognise same-sex civil unions. Same-sex marriage has been legal since 2013 and anti-discrimination laws have existed since 2003. It is common to see same-sex couples together in public, and incidents of hostility or discrimination against LGBT visitors are rare. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
