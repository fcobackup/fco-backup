Hurricanes
Hurricane Iota is forecast to make landfall in Central America on the morning of 17 November. It is expected to strengthen to a category five hurricane, potentially causing catastrophic damage as it moves inland. Flash flooding and landslides are likely and could be exacerbated following Hurricane Eta’s recent impact. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Centre. Follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
