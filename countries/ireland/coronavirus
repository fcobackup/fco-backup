Local advice
On 15 September, the Irish Government published a plan for ‘Living with COVID-19’ in the 6-9 months covering the end of 2020 and early 2021.
The revised strategy includes a ‘Framework for Restrictive Measures’ designed to allow people to understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures the government might introduce to stop escalation of the virus. The Framework consists of 5 Levels, which will be imposed depending on the incidence of COVID-19. All of Ireland is currently at Level 5, as of 21 October and will remain so until at least December 1.
You should check the Irish Government website for comprehensive guidance on public health measures currently in force.
Nationwide restrictions
Level 5 is currently in force for all of Ireland:
Level 5 restrictions include:
Social and family gatherings: there should be no visits to homes or gardens, except for essential purposes such as providing care to children, elderly or vulnerable people. If you live alone you can form a support bubble with another household. Read more here. It is possible to meet with one other household in an outdoor setting, which is not a home or garden, such as a park, including for exercise. No other social or family gatherings should take place.
No organised indoor or outdoor gatherings (in controlled environments with a named organiser) should take place.
Museums, galleries and other cultural attractions are closed.
Bars, cafes and restaurants (including hotel restaurants and bars) can only serve take away food or delivery. Wet pubs may serve takeaway and delivery only, and in Dublin they remain closed.)
Hotels, guesthouses and B&Bs may remain open, but only to support provision of essential services.
Essential retail and essential services will remain open. This includes food shopping. All other retail and personal services are closed.
You should work from home unless you are providing an essential service for which your physical presence is required.
Domestic travel restrictions – stay at home, and exercise within 5 kilometres of home. There are various exceptions to this which can be viewed here. There will be a penalty for movement beyond 5km from home that does not meet one of these exemptions.
Transport – public transport will operate at 25% capacity for the purposes of allowing essential services to get to work. People should walk or cycle where possible.
