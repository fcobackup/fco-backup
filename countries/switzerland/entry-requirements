The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You will require a valid passport or other travel document to enter Switzerland.
If you are travelling to Switzerland for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Due to COVID-19 restrictions, travellers from the UK are restricted from entry to Switzerland. UK nationals and other non-Swiss nationals arriving from a ‘high risk-country’ or outside the Schengen area are not permitted entry to Switzerland. Only the following categories of people are permitted entry:
Swiss and Liechtenstein nationals;
EU and EFTA nationals
From Saturday 26 June, travellers from UK and non-EU/EEA countries will be permitted entry, if they can adequately demonstrate they have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19;
holders of the following documents:
a residence permit, i.e. a Swiss residence permit (L / B / C / Ci permits);
a cross-border permit (G permit);
an FDFA legitimation card;
a D visa issued by Switzerland;
Holders of a ‘laissez passer’ issued by a Swiss representation in cases of ‘individual special necessity’.
Demonstrating your vaccination status from the UK is not yet formalised for entry into Switzerland, so you should follow alternative advice for entry. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Further information and a list of ‘high risk countries’ can be found on the website of the State Secretariat of Migration.
These restrictions do not apply to UK nationals who are legally resident in Switzerland; you will need to show proof of residence. These restrictions do not apply to UK nationals who are travelling from other Schengen countries.
If you do not hold a residence permit, or do not have your permit with you but are resident in Switzerland, or are otherwise exempted, you will need to apply for a ‘laissez passer’ from the Swiss Embassy in London.
Travellers from ‘high risk countries’, including the UK, will need to present a negative COVID-19 test result (PCR), carried out less than 72 hours before arrival. Anyone arriving in Switzerland by air, even from a country that is not considered high risk, will need to present a negative COVID-19 test result (PCR) before arrival. From Saturday 26 June, travellers who can adequately demonstrate they have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will no longer have to present a test on arrival.
Further information, including a list of ‘high risk countries’ are available on the Federal Office of Public Health website.
Travellers from ‘high risk countries’, including the UK, must complete an online form before entering Switzerland on arrival and provide contact details. The electronic form is available here. Further information, including a list of ‘high risk countries’, is available on the Federal Office of Public Health website.
Quarantine
Those arriving in Switzerland from the United Kingdom, regardless of nationality, are required to self-isolate for 10 days from the date of arrival. You will also need to report your arrival to the relevant cantonal authority. From Saturday 26 June, travellers who can adequately demonstrate they have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will no longer have to quarantine for 10 days.
If you do have to self-isolate, you can reduce the quarantine period to 7 days if you can produce a negative COVID-19 test result (rapid antigen test or PCR) taken from day 7 of your quarantine and have approval from the local cantonal authority. Further information is available from the Federal Office for Public Health.
Travellers entering Switzerland who have visited certain countries designated as ‘high risk’ within the past 10 days are required to quarantine. The full list of countries which are currently subject to quarantine is available on the Federal Office of Public Health website.
Transit
If you are transiting Switzerland, you are strongly advised to have your onward travel booked in advance and to have confirmed you meet the entry requirements of your destination country. You should also check the travel advice for any country that you will transit on the way back to the UK.
Further information is available on the website of the State Secretariat for Migration.
Entry into Switzerland from third countries (outside the EU/EEA and the UK)
Switzerland has lifted entry restrictions from some third countries. Further information is available on the website of the State Secretariat for Migration.
Helpline
Further advice for people travelling to Switzerland is available from an information line run by the Federal Office of Public Health on +41 58 464 44 88 (5am – 10pm GMT). Assistance is available in German, French, Italian and English.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Switzerland and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Swiss government’s entry requirements. Check the Swiss Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you may need
if you stay in Switzerland with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Switzerland. If you are resident in Switzerland, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Switzerland guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Customs regulations
For information and advice about Swiss customs regulations, visit the official website of the Federal Customs Administration.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Switzerland.
Working in Switzerland
