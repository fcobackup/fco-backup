There are currently limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Pakistan. The government of Pakistan has extended the suspension of scheduled international flights until 11:59pm PST on 15 May.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Pakistan. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Pakistan authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
UK special charter flights
From 21 April, the UK government has arranged special charter flights for British nationals who normally live in the UK, and their direct dependents, to return to the UK. Our commercial partner Corporate Travel Management (CTM) has been managing flight registrations; its registration portals are now closed. If you registered for a flight before the portals closed, you will have been placed on our waitlist. To meet the demand of the waitlist, we have now arranged two additional special charter flights on 12 and 13 May. There are no further flights planned after these.
If you registered for a flight before the portals closed, you have been offered an opportunity to pay for a seat on a flight. Eligible travellers who have paid for a flight but not yet been assigned a seat will receive a confirmation email from CTM at least 24 hours before the flight.
If you did not register for the special charter flights, we encourage you to consider commercial options for travel. CTM are not re-opening registration. There are no further UK arranged special charter flights planned.
Details of all currently scheduled charter flights:
Departure airport Arrival airport Flight dates
Islamabad London Heathrow 12 May
Islamabad Manchester 13 May
If you have paid, are eligible and are allocated a seat, you will receive a confirmation email with your flight time at least 24 hours before the flight.
Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket, as tickets will not be on sale at the airport.
The UK government is prioritising bringing home British nationals who were travelling abroad, and foreign nationals travelling with close family members who are British nationals.
Vulnerable non-British UK residents with Indefinite Leave to Remain, and other foreign nationals, may only be accommodated if there is sufficient capacity.
Your eligibility for flights, including your UK address, will be checked before your tickets are issued. If you have already paid but are not eligible for these flights, you will receive a full refund.
If you have been placed on the waitlist, you may be contacted and offered an alternative point of departure or arrival. You are strongly advised to travel on the first available flight.
Help with your registration
If you have difficulty with an existing registration , send an SMS text message containing ONLY your full name to: +44 (0) 786 009 3018 for Islamabad flights. Someone from CTM will then get in touch to assist you. You should only send one message to this number. CTM will contact you. Do not contact the High Commission directly to confirm your booking as we are unable to do so.
If you have an submitted a loan application through CTM, need to discuss this urgently, and are unable to make contact with CTM, you can contact the British High Commission on +92 (0) 51 201 2000. You should select the option for emergency assistance for British nationals.
Cancelling a flight
Links to cancel your flight are sent in registration and waitlist communications from CTM. To cancel your flight contact CTM as soon as possible using these links or by emailing. CTM will process refunds within 14 working days. If you cancel your flight less than 24 hours before a flight’s scheduled departure, you will not be eligible for a refund. If a flight is cancelled with no replacement offered, refunds will be processed within 14 working days by CTM. If you fail to show up for a flight without prior notification, you will not get on a future flight.

Financial support for commercial flights
If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM).

Travel to the airport
You will need to arrange your own travel to the airport. If you travel on the specially arranged charter flights, you should arrive at the airport at least 4 hours before the flight is due to depart.
Due to government restrictions, public transport is limited, and the authorities have discouraged all non-essential use of public transport. If you are travelling to Islamabad you should, if possible, carry printed copies of your flight confirmation and have your passports easily to hand. If you cannot get a printed flight confirmation, carry an electronic copy.
Provincial and federal authorities have stated that you will be able to travel to the airport if you have a confirmed flight ticket and valid travel document. Some provinces have limited the number of people that can be in a vehicle. In addition, people who do not have a flight ticket, except the driver, may not be allowed to accompany travellers to the airport.
If you have been placed into a quarantine centre, or you are in an area that has been quarantined by the authorities, you may have to wait until the quarantine is lifted before you can travel to the airport. Follow the advice of the relevant local authorities. If you are not allowed to travel across a checkpoint or if you are moved to a quarantine facility, call the British High Commission on 051 201 2000.
You are strongly advised not to travel to the airport if you are displaying any COVID-19 symptoms, including a high temperature. When you enter the airport, you will be thermal scanned by the Pakistani authorities. If you have a high temperature or other COVID-19 symptoms, you will not be permitted to fly. The Pakistan government are likely to take you to a quarantine facility, where you will be tested after 48 hours. If you test positive, will likely be moved to a hospital isolation facility. If you test negative, you will be released with instructions to self-isolate for a period of time determined by relevant authorities. Call us on 051 201 2000 if you are moved to a quarantine facility.
