The Myanmar authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Coronavirus cases have now been confirmed in Myanmar.
If you are in Myanmar and able to leave, you should do so. This is due to potential pressures on medical facilities and the risk of air routes out of Myanmar being cancelled. For information on how to return to the UK from Myanmar, see Return to the UK
Entry and borders
Myanmar closed all land borders with its neighbouring countries to foreigners on 19 March. Any foreign national with a valid entry visa may only enter and exit Myanmar at Yangon, Mandalay or Nay Pyi Taw International Airports.
From midnight on 24 March, Myanmar will introduce new temporary restrictive measures. All incoming foreign nationals are required to present laboratory evidence that they do not have COVID-19. This evidence has to be issued no more than 72 hours in advance of travel. All foreign nationals arriving in Myanmar will be subject to a 14-day facility government quarantine facility.
On 21 March, Myanmar introduced restrictions for UK citizens entering the country. UK passport holders are required to stay in a government quarantine centre for 14 days upon arrival, or asked to return home.
Travellers who have visited high risk areas in China (such as Hubei Province) or the South Korea (such as Daegu and Gyeongbuk Regions) in the past 14 days will not be permitted entry. This may also apply to passport holders from these countries even if they are travelling from elsewhere. This list of countries, and the nature of the restrictions, could change without warning.
Local measures
The Myanmar Government has imposed restrictions on large public events (including festivals) and cinemas.
Healthcare
If you are currently in Myanmar and are displaying symptoms of coronavirus, you should consult your healthcare provider. You may then be asked to notify the Myanmar National Hotline for Coronavirus (+95 67 3420268) and be transferred to a public health facility for testing. If you test positive for the virus, you are highly likely to be transferred to a Government quarantine hospital until you have recovered. Patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to purchase food or make phone calls.
The coronavirus pandemic is expected to put significant pressure on Myanmarâ€™s medical facilities. They may not be able to offer routine care.
It may be difficult for you to travel to a neighbouring country for medical attention. You should check your personal arrangements with your healthcare provider.
