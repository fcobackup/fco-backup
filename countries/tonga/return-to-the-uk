The Government of Tonga has announced that 105 international flights to Tonga are diverted from Tonga until Saturday 12 September 2020, except for international flights approved by the Ministry of Health. See the full list of diverted flights on the Diversion Order.
Air New Zealand will be running one flight a week for outbound passengers. This is currently scheduled for Thursdays in June and to Wednesdays in July. Please contact Air New Zealand (+64 9 357 3000) or a travel agent of your choice to check onward transit options. Details of rules on transiting via New Zealand are on the New Zealand Immigration website.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
