Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Dominica
Dominica has published travel protocols setting out its entry requirements in relation to COVID-19. Visit the Discover Dominica website for full details. You should read these before your departure and monitor the pages on a regular basis as the requirements may change at short notice. Masks should be worn at all times during your travel to Dominica and your passage through the airport. Social distancing and hygiene protocols are in place.
Arrival with a COVID 19 negative test
All travellers from the UK must present on arrival:
a valid COVID-19 PCR negative test result taken no more than 72 hours in advance of your flight’s arrival; OR
a valid Rapid Antigen negative test result taken within 48 hours in advance of your expected arrival time in Dominica.
Arriving passengers should complete an online questionnaire 24 hours before arrival. This can be completed on arrival in Dominica if you have difficulties uploading your test results. You must present a valid negative test result in order to board your flight to Dominica.
If you are unvaccinated, you should also pay XCD$100 online for the Rapid Antigen Test which you will have to undergo on arrival. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Dominica will accept the UK’s solutions to demonstrate your COVID vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Vaccinated arrivals
On arrival, once your documents have been validated, you will be considered medically cleared. No quarantine or further testing required.
Quarantine and test for unvaccinated arrivals
On arrival, you will undergo a health assessment and take a Rapid Antigen Test. If positive, you will be transported to the government isolation facility (COVID Care Complex) in Portsmouth. If negative, you will transported to a Safe-in Nature-certified property for a minimum of 5 days’ quarantine, at your own expense.
You will be required to undergo a second PCR test 5 days after arrival. If the result of that second test is negative, you will not be subject to further quarantine. If the result is positive, you may be transported to the government isolation facility in Portsmouth until you recover. Family groups can be kept together. The government aims to return results within 48 hours. While you are in the government isolation facility, you will need to pay for your own meals.
