The Tajik authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Travel restrictions
The government of Tajikistan has imposed temporary restrictions on the entry of all foreign nationals through all checkpoints into Tajikistan. Travelers entering are currently being confined for 14 days; this may be subject to change.
Further travel restrictions or restrictions of movement could be applied at short notice by the Tajik authorities.
Land border crossings between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, China and Afghanistan are closed to travellers. A small number of border points with Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan are open for cargo only.
The Tajik civil aviation authority announced the temporary suspension of all flights to and from Tajikistan starting from 20 March.
Visas
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the validity of visas and the registration of foreign citizens temporarily in Tajikistan will be extended until the epidemiological situation stabilises. Check the Tajik Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website for more information.
