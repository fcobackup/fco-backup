Given the rapidly changing situation in the region we are temporarily withdrawing a limited number of UK staff and their dependents. The British High Commission in Lesotho will continue to carry out essential work. The British High Commission in Pretoria provides consular support to British nationals in Lesotho.

Visitors to Lesotho must travel or transit via South Africa. South Africa has put in place travel restrictions on individuals from countries affected by coronavirus (COVID-19), including the United Kingdom and has closed its airspace to commercial airlines. Follow our travel advice for South Africa and consult your nearest South African High Commission.
Bookings for the UK special flights from South Africa to the UK (9 – 17 April) have now closed. There are currently no further special flights organised from Lesotho or South Africa. The British High Commission in Maseru is in contact with airlines, the Lesotho authorities and other governments to explore commercial flight options for returning British travellers to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated with further information on options to return to the UK once this information is available. See Return to the UK.
Most visits to Lesotho are trouble free.
There are ongoing political tensions and occasional spontaneous political demonstrations in Maseru. On 18 April, the military were briefly deployed in Maseru. You should avoid demonstrations, rallies and large public gatherings and stay at home if there is any unusual activity by the security forces.
There is often an increase in criminal activity, especially property crimes, leading up to the holiday season. Take extra care and be vigilant during this period. See Crime
Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Lesotho, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
