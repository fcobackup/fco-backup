The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of the Netherlands based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks. Check separate travel advice pages for advice on travel to the constituent countries and special municipalities located in the Dutch Caribbean.
If you are returning to the UK from the Netherlands, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
The Dutch Government has announced that from 1 January 2021, non-EU/EEA nationals and nationals of non-Schengen states, including UK nationals, will not be permitted entry to the Netherlands for non-essential purposes due to EU-wide COVID-19 restrictions. Please see the Dutch Government’s website for a list of exemptions. This measure does not apply to UK nationals who are legally resident in the Netherlands, who will be allowed to re-enter the country, but will need to show proof of residence.
The Dutch Government requires all international travellers aged 13 and above travelling by aeroplane, passenger ferry, train and coach to be in possession of a negative PCR COVID-19 test result and a completed test declaration. There are some limited exemptions to this requirement, listed on the Dutch Government’s website.
In addition, from Friday 15 January 00:01 (NL time) the Dutch government requires travellers from the UK by aeroplane to undergo a rapid antigen test in addition to the PCR test at their point of departure. This also applies to those categories currently exempt from PCR tests.
The test requirements do not replace the requirement to self-isolate for 10 days upon arrival (see below).
See the Dutch Government’s website for further information.
If you’re travelling to or from the Netherlands by air you must complete a health screening form and have it ready to show on request during your journey, whether you are at the departure airport, on the aircraft or at the arrival airport
If you’re travelling to the Netherlands from the UK, you should also self-isolate for ten days upon arrival in the Netherlands. If you’re staying in the Netherlands for fewer than ten days then you should quarantine for the duration of your stay.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
