Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Hong-Kong. The authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Health Declaration form
All inbound travellers via Hong Kong International Airport are required to submit a health declaration form.
Applicability of Hong Kong Government Measures
The Hong Kong SAR Government have implemented a range of quarantine measures in recent weeks. The exact arrangements of quarantine vary depending on where you have been to and when. Travellers arriving in Hong Kong on flights from overseas countries/territories, who are not Hong Kong residents, will be denied entry to Hong Kong. Non-Hong Kong residents travelling to Hong Kong from mainland China, Macao or Taiwan will also be denied entry if they have been to any overseas country/territory in the past 14 days. Hong Kong residents entering Hong Kong will have to take a mandatory medical test for Covid-19. All Hong Kong residents will be required to undergo 14-day compulsory quarantine, this is usually taken at a residential address, but arrivals may be placed in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre.
Until 11.59pm on Tuesday 24 March, the following measures apply:
All travellers entering Hong Kong will be required to enter compulsory quarantine for 14 days. This includes travellers coming to Hong Kong from the United Kingdom. For Hong Kong residents, including foreign nationals who live in Hong Kong, this quarantine can take place at home. For non-Hong Kong residents, such as tourists and business visitors, this will be in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre. Those who enter Hong Kong from Macao or Taiwan, and have been in those locations for at least 14 days prior, will not be required to undertake quarantine.
Travellers who have been in the Hubei Province of mainland China in the 14 days prior to arrival in Hong Kong, and who are not Hong Kong residents, will be denied entry to Hong Kong.
All travellers who have been in the following locations 14 days prior to arrival in Hong Kong will still be required to enter compulsory quarantine at a Hong Kong government quarantine centre for 14 days: Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do regions in South Korea; Iran; and the Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy and Veneto regions in Italy.
For all quarantine arrangements in Hong Kong:
Individuals will be expected to activate sharing of their real-time location with the Hong Kong government, or be tagged electronically as part of the requirement to report their location to the Hong Kong government.
Individuals are not allowed to leave their designated quarantine location for 14 days, which means they will also be unable to leave Hong Kong for the duration of the quarantine
It will not be possible to serve your 14 day quarantine period in a hotel.
It is likely you will have to contribute around Â£20 (HK $200) per night towards the cost of your quarantine centre.
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions may result in a six month prison sentence and a substantial fine. You should comply with the requirements of your quarantine arrangements.
Health restrictions and Transit through Hong Kong Airport
From Wednesday 25 March, transit services will be suspended at Hong Kong International Airport.
Until 11.59pm on Tuesday 25 March those transiting through Hong Kong airport will not be automatically subject to mandatory quarantine, but will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Those deemed to have high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If they meet further risk criteria, they will be transferred to Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory checks/treatment.
See the Hong Kong Government coronavirus website for further details.
All border crossings with mainland China remain closed indefinitely, with the exception of the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.
