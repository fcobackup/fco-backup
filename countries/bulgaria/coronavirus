Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
COVID-19 related restrictions remain under review.
The police are strictly enforcing measures and failure to comply could result in a fine.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will be required to self-isolate for 7 days. Additionally, there is a mandatory 5-day self-isolation requirement (starting from the date of last contact with the infected person) for anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. During self-isolation you are not permitted to leave Bulgaria.
The 5-day mandatory self-isolation period for close contacts may be revoked for close contacts who are vaccinated with a booster dose and who present a negative PCR test taken 72 hours after the mandatory self-isolation period commenced. The mandatory self-isolation requirement is revoked from the day after the registration of the negative result. Results will automatically be registered by the test centre when they produce the result certificate.
From 18 August to 25 August, it is mandatory to wear a face mask in medical establishments including pharmacies, opticians and social care institutions, and on public transport. These measures apply across the country and replace the previous regional rules. These measures do not apply to children under the age of 6.
It is no longer necessary to present a COVID vaccination certificate to visit indoor venues.
