Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Vietnam. The Vietnamese authorities have introduced a large number of measures to limit the spread of the virus including temporarily banning visits by foreigners and compulsory quarantine and self-isolation for anyone suspected of coming in to contact with the virus. The Vietnamese government has confirmed that it will cover quarantine costs, but foreign nationals will be personally responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs, and hotel costs from periods of self-isolation. You should follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus.
You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.

Quarantine
Widespread quarantine requirements are in place for anyone who may have come in to contact with coronavirus. The Vietnamese government has confirmed that it will cover quarantine costs, but foreign nationals will be personally responsible for paying for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs, and hotel costs from periods of self-isolation.
Vietnamese quarantine centres are basic, and most do not meet Public Health England standards.
If you come in to contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus you must expect to undergo quarantine in a government centre. It lasts a minimum of 14 days and longer if you test positive at any point. In addition, if you test positive, you will be treated in a Vietnamese hospital, following which you will be expected to undertake a period of self-isolation. You should expect to be tested at least 5 times prior to release, and will be required to produce 3 consecutive negative tests during quarantine and a further two consecutive negative tests during self-isolation. Once you have completed quarantine and self-isolation you should receive a document specifying this. Please retain this as you may need to present it customs/airport officials when you leave Vietnam.
Vietnam’s quarantine requirements are mandate by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. The British Embassy and Consulate General are unable to intervene in having these requirements waived, shortened or changed. Violations carry strict penalties. Should you have serious reservations about undertaking quarantine in Vietnam if required for health or other reasons, you are strongly advised to return to the UK as soon as possible.
There have been some instances of British nationals being turned away from, or asked to leave, hotels in Vietnam.
You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.
Local measures
On 22 April Vietnamese authorities announced plans for a phased relaxation of the partial lock down measures. There may be some variation of relaxation of lock down measures between cities and provinces and also within parts of some cities. The changes will see a gradual lifting of the strict social distancing policies and shops and services will re-open and re-start. However, the basic principles of social distancing will remain in place . Large gatherings are not allowed inside or outside buildings. Festivals, sporting events, religious and major cultural activities remain suspended. People are still required to wear masks in public and maintain a distance of 2 metres between individuals in public places. Internal flights will increase in number but will remain significantly below pre-COVID-19 levels. Taxis and buses will restrict the number of people allowed to travel in one vehicle.
British nationals should be alert to local variations, take a precautionary approach and be ready to comply with local authorities.
