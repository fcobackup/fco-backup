Niger is a Muslim country. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas.
In 2018, the holy month of Ramadan is expected to start on 16 May and finish on 15 June. See Travelling during Ramadan.
Donâ€™t photograph military or government installations.
You should carry some form of identification at all times. This would normally mean your passport or residence permit. If you drive outside the main towns, the likelihood of having to produce some form of identification is high.
If you commit a criminal offence you will be subjected to local law. Local prison conditions are harsh.
Homosexuality is illegal, but in practice is tolerated if discreet. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
