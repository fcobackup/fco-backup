Rusizi District
FCDO now advises against all but essential travel to the parts of Rusizi District which are within 10km of the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), including the Rwandan islands in Lake Kivu and Kamembe Airport.
Rwanda-DRC border
Risks associated with increased fighting in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) may affect people on the Rwandan side of the border, in both Rubavu and Risizi districts. There are risks because of the closeness of the potential fighting. You may see a presence of military personnel on both sides of the border. On 27 January, there were reports of gunfire and artillery fire in Gisenyi. The security situation in DRC near to Rwanda’s border is unstable (see Democratic Republic of the Congo’s travel advice for more information). Keep up to date with developments through local media.
The border crossings between Rwanda and DRC at Gisenyi-Goma could close at short notice.
