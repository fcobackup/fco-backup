The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
the autonomous region of the Azores, based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks
If you are arriving in England from Portugal (including the autonomous regions of Madeira and Azores) you will need to self-isolate on your arrival, unless you have a valid exemption. Check the latest guidance for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Travel to Portugal is subject to entry restrictions
Entry to Portugal is allowed if you are a returning resident. For all other travellers, entry is limited to essential purposes only if you are travelling from:
the UK or any other non-EU/EEA country, or
an EU/EEA country where the COVID-19 incidence rate exceeds 150 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
Essential purposes include travelling to live with immediate family members, or for professional, educational, health or humanitarian reasons.
See Entry requirements and the Portuguese Immigration Service website for more information.
Transit through Spanish airports from the UK to Portugal is only allowed if you are resident in Portugal. There may be testing requirements for transiting Spain by road. See FCDO travel advice for Spain.
You will be required to show a negative RT-PCR test result for SARS/COVID-19 taken within 72 hours of departure (not required for children aged 2 or under), see the Portuguese Immigration Service website. Your airline is likely to deny boarding if you cannot provide evidence of a negative RT-PCR test at check-in. Check with your airline before you travel.
If your journey to mainland Portugal originated in Brazil, India, South Africa or in an EU member state where the COVID-19 incidence rate exceeds 500 per 100,000 inhabitants, or you have been in one of these countries in the last 14 days, you must self-isolate for 14 days on arrival at home or at a place indicated by the Portuguese health authority. See the Portuguese Immigration Service website for more information and complete this form before you travel.
If you arrive in Madeira or Porto Santo without an RT-PCR test, you will be required to take one at the airport and await the result in government provided accommodation.
See Entry requirements for more information before you travel.

check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
