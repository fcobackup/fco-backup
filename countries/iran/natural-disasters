To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Some provinces of Iran, particularly Khuzestan, Golestan and Lorestan, can suffer from floods in Spring. You should follow any advice given by local authorities and ensure you are adequately equipped when driving and walking.
