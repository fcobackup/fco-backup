This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Slovakia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Slovak Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Slovakia.
Passport validity requirements
To travel to Slovakia, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
To enter Slovakia (and all Schengen countries) your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document, or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
You could get a fine of 1600 euros if you stay longer than legally allowed.
Checks at border control
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
If you’re a visitor, your passport must be stamped when you enter or leave the Schengen area (which includes Slovakia). Border guards will use passport stamps to check you haven’t overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for stays in the Schengen area. If your passport was not stamped, border guards will presume you have overstayed the visa-free limit.
If your passport was not stamped, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
Read about passport stamping if you live in Slovakia.
At border control in Slovakia, you may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation or proof of address for a second home
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area (including Slovakia) for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
If you’re travelling to Slovakia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer (for example, to work, study or for business), you must meet the Slovak government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Slovak Embassy in the UK.
If you stay in Slovakia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Applying for a visa
Fill in the visa application form and book an appointment to attend the embassy in person using the online visa application service for Slovakia.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Slovakia guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Slovakia. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions for medical reasons, for example certain amounts of powdered infant milk, infant food, or pet food. Check the rules about taking food and drink into the EU on the European Commission website.
Registering with the police
Foreign nationals visiting Slovakia must report where they’re staying in Slovakia at their nearest Foreigners Police Department. If you are staying at a hotel, the hotel will do this for you. If you are in private accommodation, you must notify the police by letter, email or in person within 3 working days of your arrival.
If you plan to stay in Slovakia for a longer period, you must register formally. Visit the website of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic (in Slovak) for more information.
