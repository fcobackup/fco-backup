This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the BVI immigration department.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 entry requirements for the BVI.
Countries may restrict travel or bring in rules at short notice. Check with your travel company or airline for changes.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Visit TravelHealthPro (from the UK’s National Travel Health Network and Centre) for general COVID-19 advice for travellers.
Airport and ferry charges
Visitors arriving by air or sea are charged an environmental and tourism levy of 10 dollars on arrival.
There is an airport tax of 50 US dollars for all passengers, to be paid when leaving the BVI by air. This consists of:
15 dollars departure tax
5 dollars security charge departure tax
30 dollars airport development fee
The tax is generally included in the ticket price.
If you’re departing the BVI by ferry, you must pay a departure tax of 20 dollars per person or 15 dollars for residents.
Passport validity requirements
If you’re visiting the BVI, your passport should be valid for the period of your stay.
If you are a resident in the BVI, your passport must be valid for at least 3 months from the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visa requirements
British nationals do not need a visa to visit the BVI. The BVI immigration authorities will issue you with a 1-month entry stamp on arrival. You may also be granted an extension for 1 further month.
Extensions for up to 6 months are granted on the discretion of the Chief Immigration Officer, if you can show proof of independent financial means. You may need evidence of accommodation and your plans to leave the BVI at the end of your stay.
Work permits
Travellers who hold an expired work permit and are re-entering the BVI must submit a written request to the Immigration Department at least 5 working days before travel. This also applies to holders of valid work permit exemptions.
For all other immigration and labour matters, including work permits, contact the BVI authorities:
Immigration Department
Labour Department
If you’re transiting through the BVI
If you’re transiting through the BVI on your way to another country, there is no COVID-19 testing or proof of vaccination status required. However, you should meet the requirements of the country of destination. More information can be found on the Government of the Virgin Islands website.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need on TravelHealthPro (from the UK’s National Travel Health Network and Centre).
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of the BVI. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Follow customs rules on the import and export of agricultural products and the protection of marine and animal life. There are several marine and animal specimens that must not be taken from the BVI. Check with local customs authorities or the Government’s Conservation & Fisheries Department before buying or attempting to import or export these items.
