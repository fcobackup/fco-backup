On 25 March, all international flights to and from Kenya were suspended by the Kenyan government, with the exception of specially negotiated repatriation flights and cargo flights. Crew must observe strict guidelines. This suspension will be lifted on 1 August.
Medical certificate requirements
The Government of Kenya requires passengers entering Kenya to produce a medical certificate confirming they are free of COVID-19. Tests must be taken within 7 days of flight departure. The cost of a COVID-19 test will not be included in the ticket price.
Tests in Kenya are available from: Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi Hospital, Nairobi West Hospital, Lancet Labs, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), or contact county health officials for test availability in state hospitals in the counties. You will need to pay for your test. Results should take 24 hours. Results will be shared with you, and test results from KEMRI and Lancet Labs may be shared with Kenya Airways.
Re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
