Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
What should you do if you test positive in Libya before returning to the UK?
You will be required to self-isolate in either a hotel or private accommodation until you test negative for COVID-19. If medical assistance is required, you should call the Ministry of Health operations room:
Central Operations Room: 199
Operations Room - western and southern regions: 0214631334 - 0910912743 - 0910912724
Operations Room: eastern region: 06147474602 - 0614747609 - 0920123444
COVID-19 Operations Room - for quick response and emergencies: 0214629191 - 0214629022
Whilst self-isolating you can expect to be contacted by the municipality you are quarantining in.
If you leave the hotel or private accommodation you are quarantining in, you will not be able to receive any assistance from the authorities. You will not be stopped from leaving Libya but you must ensure you check onward travel rules.
