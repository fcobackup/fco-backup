The use of ATMs and credit cards is confined to a limited number of hotels and other businesses in the larger cities. Only exchange money at bureaux de change in the international airports and larger hotels, or at banks in the main cities. Don’t change money on the streets. Algeria has strict foreign exchange laws and the Dinar can’t be exported.
