Air travel
Thai Airlines and Thai Smile flights between Vientiane and Bangkok, were suspended with effect from 27 March 2020. You should check any future booking with your airline.
Flights via China will not be permitted in the near future, as China has effectively stopped non-Chinese nationals from entering the country. You should check with the airline for the latest information on transit arrangements in China. You should also monitor our China travel advice for updates.
You should keep checking airline websites for the latest information, and to book any available flights directly. Not all third party providers will have up to date information for new flight options.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travel via Thailand
An Emergency Decree came into force on 26 March 2020, initially until 30 April. It means the Thai authorities have barred all foreign nationals from entering or transiting Thailand except in certain limited circumstances. Please check the Thailand travel advice for further details.
The Thai Government has announced that all Thai-Lao border crossings are closed until further notice, including the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge between Vientiane and Nong Khai. Only commercial goods are permitted to cross for the near future.
If you cannot leave Laos at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs. Please be aware a number of hotels/hostels have closed at this time.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
