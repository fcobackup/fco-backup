What to do
If you want to return to the UK, please keep checking our travel advice, local media and contact local travel agents and airlines for the most up to date information on the resumption of flight operations. You can also sign up for email alerts, follow the Embassy on Twitter and contact us to find out more about options for leaving Afghanistan here.
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you’re not happy with their response, you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
