Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Armenia.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Armenia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Armenian Embassy in the UK. 
COVID-19 rules 
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Armenia. 
Passport validity requirements 
If you are visiting Armenia, your passport must be valid for the duration of your stay.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to. 
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.  
Visa requirements 
You can visit Armenia without a visa up to 180 days per year. 
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must register with the Administration Department for Passports and Visas (OVIR).
