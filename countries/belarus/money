There are plenty of ATMs in major cities. However, currently there are difficulties withdrawing cash using foreign credit and debit cards. Almost all major banks in Belarus do not accept foreign issued cards and those that do may charge a higher rate of commission. There is also limited cash available, with many ATMs having limits on the amount of cash you can withdraw, particularly for foreign cards. Not all cards will be accepted in Belarus. Many reputable international money transfer providers have suspended operations in Belarus. You should consider having cash in US dollars or Euros if you decide to visit Belarus.
The UK government has imposed sanctions against a range of Belarusian companies and individuals. These may impact on financial transactions.
Please be aware, currently it can be difficult to exchange foreign currency for Belarusian roubles. You may be asked to present your passport at a foreign currency exchange. You should only exchange foreign currency at government licensed booths. These can be found in or near major stores, hotels, banks and shopping centres. Exchanging money elsewhere can result in fines and/or arrest and the currency involved will be confiscated. It’s not possible to exchange Belarusian roubles into other currencies outside Belarus.
Inform your UK bank of your intended travel to Belarus before you depart to ensure they don’t block your card because of suspicion of fraudulent use in a foreign country. Please note, many banks have suspended their services in Belarus, so please check with your provider.
