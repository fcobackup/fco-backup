Advance fee frauds
Individuals and companies in the UK (and elsewhere) often receive letters, faxes and e-mails, offering them large sums of money provided they send various ‘advance fees’ to Taiwanese bank accounts. Fraudsters obtain contact details from telephone or commercial directories, so recipients are not being specifically targeted.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) investigates advance fee frauds in the UK. Do not reply to these types of communication. The NCA website contains more information on this type of fraud.
Local travel
There’s a risk of road blockages and landslides following typhoons, especially in central and southern Taiwan. You should check the Central Weather Bureau website and the Directorate General of Highways website before travelling.
Road travel
To drive in Taiwan you need an (IDP). Once in Taiwan, you will need to take your passport, IDP and a passport photograph to the nearest Vehicle Registration Department and apply for a driver’s licence visa, which will then be secured in your IDP.
You will need to obtain an International Driving Permit (IDP) from the Post Office before coming to Taiwan. The AA no longer provides IDPs. If you’re staying in Taiwan longer term and wish to drive, you may need to obtain a local driving licence in order to comply with local laws and regulations. At present, it’s not possible to exchange a UK driving licence for a local driving licence. Do not drive a vehicle without a valid licence.
The alcohol limit for drivers in Taiwan is lower than in the UK. The current legal limit is 0.15 micrograms of alcohol per 1000 millilitres of breath or 0.03% blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Driving while over the limit can result in heavy fines and imprisonment. Passengers may also be fined.
Be alert crossing roads, even on protected crossings.
Consular assistance
The UK does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The British Assistance and Services Section of the British Office in Taipei can provide certain limited consular assistance. In cases of genuine emergency, the British Office may be able to issue you with an emergency travel document.
