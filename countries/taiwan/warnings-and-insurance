The UK does not recognise Taiwan as a state and has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan, so limited support is available to British nationals. Please refer to the British Office in Taipei for further information.
Extreme heavy rain warnings  
Heavy rain in central and southern Taiwan sets to continue and evacuations are taking place. Continuous rain is expected until Monday 4 August. In mountainous areas, stay alert to the risk of landslides, falling rocks, debris and flash floods. Low-lying areas should be on guard for flooding.
