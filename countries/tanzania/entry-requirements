This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Tanzania set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Testing/screening on arrival
All passengers arriving in Tanzania will be required to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate upon arrival. The test should be taken within 72 hours of arrival into Tanzania. All passengers travelling to Tanzania must complete an online Traveller’s Surveillance Form. This form must be submitted no more than 24 hours before arrival.
All passengers entering Tanzania will be subjected to enhanced screening for COVID-19 including a mandatory rapid test. The cost for rapid testing is 25 USD per traveller which can be paid for through the online Traveller Surveillance Form or in cash on arrival. The Government of Tanzania is also implementing temperature scanning for all international passengers arriving into Tanzania.
Quarantine requirements
If you test positive for COVID-19 on arrival, you will be required to self-isolate for 14 days.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Data collection
The Government of Tanzania is collecting tracking information for all international passengers arriving into Tanzania.
Regular entry restrictions
Visas
All British passport holders need a tourist or business visa to enter Tanzania. Tanzania has introduced an ‘e-visas’ system through which applications can be submitted and approved online in advance of travel. It is no longer possible to get a visa from the Tanzanian High Commission in London.
It is also possible to get a tourist or business visa for a single entry on arrival at main ports of entry to Tanzania, subject to the fulfilment of all immigration requirements. You may be asked to provide proof of your return journey. You will not be able to get a multiple entry visa on arrival. For further information about visas visit the Tanzanian immigration website.
If you are planning to work or volunteer, you will need a valid work permit which can also be applied for online via the Tanzanian immigration website. Your employer or volunteer organisation should arrange this before you travel.
From December 2015, Carrying on Temporary Assignment (CTA) passes are no longer valid. If you’re working on a short term assignment you must apply to the Ministry of Labour and Employment for a short term work permit. The application should be submitted prior to entering the country.
If you overstay the validity of your visa or permit you can be arrested, detained and fined before being deported. Reports made to the British High Commission by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) British passport holders have indicated that they are experiencing additional levels of harassment from immigration officials. In these circumstances, you should stay calm and request that the Consular section of the British High Commission is immediately informed.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of your visa application.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents, with a minimum of six months’ validity, are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Tanzania.
