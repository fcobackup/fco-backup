This section has safety advice for regions of Morocco. It only covers regions where the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Western Sahara
Western Sahara is a disputed territory. If you’re in Western Sahara and need emergency help from the UK government, contact the British Embassy in Rabat, Morocco, who provide consular assistance for Western Sahara. See Western Sahara travel advice.
Morocco-Algeria border
The authorities have closed land and sea borders between Morocco and Algeria. They patrol and closely monitor them. Do not attempt to cross the border – it is illegal to cross without authorisation.
If you are in a boat or jet ski, make sure you:
know where the border is
stay within Moroccan waters
have enough fuel to return to shore
People entering Algerian waters illegally are likely to be intercepted and investigated.
