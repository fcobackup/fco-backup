Temporary Closure of Buccoo Reef Marine Park
Following a shark attack on a tourist at Turtle Beach/Courland Bay 26 April 2024, the Tobago authorities have temporarily closed the Buccoo Reef Marine Park (BRMP) until further notice. This closure is effective immediately and applies to all recreational activities, including snorkelling, diving, glass-bottom boat tours, and any other water-based activities within the park boundaries.  The Tobago authorities strongly advise all beachgoers, fisherfolk, and mariners to exercise extreme caution when operating in the coastal areas surrounding Plymouth, Courland Bay, Black Rock, Mt. Irvine, Buccoo, Pigeon Point, Store Bay, and all areas in between.  You should check and follow the advice of local authorities.
