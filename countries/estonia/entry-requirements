The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Travel restrictions and borders
Temporary border controls were introduced from 17 March limiting entry to Estonian nationals, those with an Estonian Residence Permit or foreign citizens with family members in Estonia. All those entering are required to complete a health declaration on arrival and self-quarantine for 14 days. There are some exceptions to this including diplomats, healthcare workers and those transporting goods and raw materials, provided they are asymptomatic.
The Estonian Police and Border Guard will carry out health checks at international border crossing points (land, ports and airports) to identify travellers’ country of departure and check for symptoms of coronavirus.
The lifting of border crossing restrictions between Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has been announced by the governments of the three Baltic countries.
From 15 May, British Nationals who are legally resident in Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania may move freely between these three countries provided they meet all of the following three conditions:
you are not in quarantine due to COVID-19 infection or contact with a COVID-19 case
you have not visited another country outside of Lithuania, Latvia or Estonia during the previous 14 days
you have no symptoms of a respiratory infection when crossing State borders.
You should follow the local quarantine measures of the country that you are in.
See detailed information about border crossings on the Estonian government official crisis portal.
