Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Thailand.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Thailand set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Royal Thai Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
Countries may restrict travel or bring in rules at short notice. Check with your travel company or airline for changes.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
You should also read TravelHealthPro’s general COVID-19 advice for travellers.
Travel to Thailand
If you are visiting Thailand and then travelling to a country that requires an RT-PCR test for entry, you will need to buy medical insurance that covers COVID-19 treatment before you arrive in Thailand.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from when you enter Thailand.
You could be refused entry to Thailand if your passport is damaged or has pages missing.
If you’re a dual national, to avoid problems at immigration, you must leave Thailand on the same passport you used to enter.
If you need to renew or apply for a new British passport, see overseas British passport applications.
Visa requirements
British passport holders arriving by air or land can enter Thailand for 30 days without a visa (visa exemption).
If you intend to stay longer (for work, study or other reasons) you need a visa before you travel.
For more information on visas or entry requirements, contact the Royal Thai Embassy or local Immigration Office.
Overstaying your visa
If you stay beyond the period of your visa, you will be fined 500 Thai baht a day up to a maximum of 20,000 baht. You risk being:
held in detention
deported at your own expense
banned from re-entering Thailand for up to 10 years
Conditions in detention centres can be harsh.
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need on TravelHealthPro.
Depending on your circumstances, this may include a yellow fever vaccination certificate.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Thailand. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Importing cigarettes
It is illegal to import more than 200 cigarettes per person into Thailand. This is enforced at customs on arrival. If you go over the limit, you could be fined 10 times the value. Your cigarettes will likely be confiscated.
