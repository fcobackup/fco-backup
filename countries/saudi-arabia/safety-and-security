Opportunistic attacks on Saudi or western targets are also possible. You should be vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities. On 28 June 2023, security forces shot and killed an armed man who fired shots near the US Consulate, which led to the death of a US Consulate worker. On 29 October 2020, there were local reports of a knife attack at the French Consulate in Jeddah.
Political situation
Public demonstrations are illegal in Saudi Arabia. Follow local media and be alert to local and regional developments which might trigger public disturbances. You should avoid protests or demonstrations. Despite warnings issued by the authorities, demonstrations do take place from time to time. Violent clashes occurred between demonstrators and security forces in 2017, mainly in the Shia communities in the Qatif area of Eastern Province, including Al Musawara village in Al-Awamiya, and Al Hasa.
Local travel
The Saudi authorities have declared ‘out of bounds’ a zone of 20km from the entire northern border of the country, and from the border in the Hafr Al-Batin and Khafji areas in the Eastern Province. Violations are punishable by up to 30 months’ imprisonment and a SAR 25,000 fine. Land border crossings remain open and the authorities have announced that signs are being placed in areas where vehicles are allowed to cross.
Due to security operations within the Qatif region of Eastern Province, British Embassy staff have been advised to travel within this region in daylight hours only. We advise that you leave the area should any security operations commence, and follow the instructions of police and security forces to assist you in reaching safe areas.
Tourist trips to military zones or border posts are banned by the Saudi Tourism Authority.
Local travel - Saudi Arabia-Yemen border
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advise against all travel to within 10km of the border with Yemen, and against all but essential travel between 10km and 80km of this border. If you’re currently in an area to which the FCDO advise against all but essential travel, you should consider whether you have an essential reason to remain. If you don’t, you should leave the area.
Saudi Arabia has been leading coalition air strikes in Yemen since March 2015 following the request for support from the Government of Yemen to deter continued Houthi aggression. Clashes along the Saudi-Yemeni border continue, resulting in both military and civilian casualties.
Missiles, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (drones) and water borne IEDs continue to be launched into Saudi Arabia, targeting critical national infrastructure, including aviation interests and oil infrastructure. Many of these have been intercepted and destroyed by Saudi air defence systems.
Attacks against critical national infrastructure are likely. Energy facilities in the Kingdom have been targeted. Abha International Airport (Asir province) has been the target of a number of attacks, resulting in injury to civilians and the death of one.
There have been 11 intercepted missile attacks over Riyadh since the first missile attack on 4 November 2017, the most recent on 6 December 2021.
In the event of an incident, you should stay indoors, monitor local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Airports near the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border have been closed temporarily from time to time. You should check with your airline before travelling to airports near the border.
Local travel - Saudi Arabia-Iraq border
Take great care in all areas close to the Saudi Arabia-Iraq border. On 5 January 2015, 3 Saudi Arabian border guards were killed in clashes close to the Arar crossing point.
Crime
Although the crime rate in Saudi Arabia is low, there have been some isolated incidents of more serious crimes. Take particular care when travelling outside towns and cities.
Petty crime does also occur.
Road travel
You can drive using UK driving licences in Saudi Arabia for 3 months from arrival. For longer periods, you will need to convert your UK licence to a local one. Where possible, keep to major roads. When travelling to more rural areas, take precautions such as travelling in convoy and during daylight.
Standards of driving are poor and there are a high number of serious accidents. You should wear seatbelts at all times. Distances between cities are large and emergency services can take some time to get to any accidents or emergencies.
Some Saudi cities have implemented an automated traffic system. You’ll need to pay any fines issued through this system before leaving the country. You can pay at the airport but only during regular Saudi office hours.
Sea travel
Oil infrastructure remains a possible terrorist target. Shipping serving the oil installations should make sure SSPs are implemented fully and robustly while operating in the area. All ships should maintain a high state of vigilance while in Saudi Arabian ports, and report anything suspicious to the authorities. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb areas may be at increased risk of maritime attack from pirates.
