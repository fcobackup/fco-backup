This page has information on travelling to Aruba.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Aruba set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Aruba’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
The following requirements for entry to Aruba apply to all travellers, regardless of vaccination status.
Precise rules are subject to change and you should follow any instructions given on arrival at immigration or airport testing facilities.
You must get approval to travel to Aruba through the embarkation / disembarkation card online before departure. This includes taking out mandatory insurance covering COVID-19. Visit the website of the Government of Aruba for the latest information.
Travellers to Aruba do not need to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.
Children and young people

If you’re transiting through Aruba
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. Check with your airline before departing.
Travellers who are transiting without entering Aruba don’t need a negative test or proof of vaccination. You will need to complete the embarkation / disembarkation process.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the duration of your stay in Aruba. You don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this. You will be permitted entry as long as your passport does not expire before the end of your stay.
Visas
British passport holders do not need a visa for stays of up to 3 months. For further information about entry requirements, contact the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
Further information on visa requirements can be found at the Netherlands and You website.
