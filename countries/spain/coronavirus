Travel in Spain
You should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect yourself and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus.
From 10pm local time on October 2, the Spanish Health Ministry advises regional governments to apply entry and exit restrictions in areas with populations of 100,000 or more, and whose COVID-19 incidence rate and ICU capacity are higher than the specified threshold. These measures will be in place until further notice.
Many municipalities across Spain are affected by these measures, including the cities of Leon and Palencia, and a number of other individual municipalities across the country.
On October 9, the Spanish government declared a State of Emergency in the region of Madrid and has imposed entry and exit restrictions to the municipality of central Madrid and surrounding areas. The State of Emergency is expected to be in place for 15 days. There are some exemptions to entering and exiting confined areas such as travel to your place of employment, attendance at medical appointments or transiting the area to return to your place of residence, however entry for tourism purposes is not currently permitted and should be avoided.
If you think you have reason to qualify as exempt and need to travel into or out of a confined area, you should carry evidence of your reason for travel such as a certificate from your employer, proof of medical appointment, or proof of onward journey such as train or flight tickets. To find out more about specific exemptions you should refer to guidance from local authorities.
Many municipalities without entry and exit restrictions have introduced other types of measures such as controls on opening hours (usually a 10pm curfew), and have reduced capacity for bars and restaurants. In many parts of Spain, nightclubs remain closed. Social gathering limitations may vary between a maximum of 5 to 10 people depending on where you are in Spain.
