Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed on Montserrat. The Montserratian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
From 26 March only resident permit holders and Montserratians (and family members) will be allowed to enter Montserrat and the Government of Montserrat has introduced enhanced health screening and all new arrivals will need to self-isolate for a 14 day period. Individuals who exhibit signs of the virus may face quarantining at the discretion of the Medical Officer.
From 1800 on 28 March for an initial period to 14 April, Montserrat is under a 24 hour curfew. Only one person per household is allowed out each day for essential tasks, like shopping. Everyone else must stay home. Gatherings of more than 4 people have also been prohibited. Schools have been closed since 16 March.
