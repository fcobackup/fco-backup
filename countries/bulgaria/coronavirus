Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The Bulgarian authorities have declared a national state of emergency until 13 May 2020.
Borders and travel
The Bulgarian Government has announced severe restrictions on international travel, forbidding entry to British nationals from midnight 17/18 March, except for those with permanent or long term residence in Bulgaria.
From 16th April 2020, flights between Bulgaria and the UK have been suspended indefinitely. Most land borders are closed for passenger traffic. If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Interior (English and Bulgarian).
The ski resort of Bansko is no longer under quarantine but statewide measures continue to apply. On 15 April 2020, Bulgarian authorities announced that the village of Panicherevo, Stara Zagora region, will be subject to a 14-day quarantine due to a number of confirmed coronavirus cases.
The British Embassy Sofia is issuing daily updates on Facebook with the latest available information.

Local measures
Measures include cancellation of cultural and sporting events; closure of shops, except food shops and pharmacies; closure of parks, bars and restaurants; and closure of schools and universities; a ban on groups of more than two adults congregating together; and a ban on leaving and entering towns without a valid reason (travel to work or home or for medical reasons or to support a vulnerable person). The police are strictly enforcing these measures. Failure to comply could result in a 300 to 1,000 lev (£135-£450) fine.
