The government of Senegal is encouraging those with any information or concerns about coronavirus to call this number: +221 800 00 50 50.
On 23 March President Macky Sall declared a national state of emergency. The range of measures designed to stop the spread of the virus includea curfew from 20h00 to 06h00 and the possibility of: prohibiting gatherings and demonstrations on public highways; limiting and prohibiting travel from one region to another, as well as the movement of people, vehicles and goods in given locations or times; banning public or private meeting places as well as all public or private gatherings that could lead to civil disturbance. Senegalese authorities have told us that essential movement during curfew, such as moving to an airport or getting emergency medicine, will be allowed but you can expect to be challenged to justify your movements. You should consider getting to the airport in time to respect the curfew and making sure that your driver is also able to justify his return journey.
There is a ban on all scheduled commercial air transport since 20 March with the exception of flights with ‘special authorisation’. Please check with your airline before travelling.
