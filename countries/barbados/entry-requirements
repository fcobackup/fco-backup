Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Barbados
Barbados plans to amend its entry requirements to coincide with the re-opening of airspace and resumption of commercial flights.
Testing on arrival
All persons arriving in Barbados should be tested for COVID-19 at an accredited laboratory. You must take a COVID-19 PCR antigen test 72 hours in advance of your flight. The standard of test must be ISO, or CAP, or in the case of the UK, UKAS compliant, or equivalent. If you’re arriving from CARICOM countries, you’re allowed to be tested up to one week before travel. If you receive a certificate confirming you are COVID-19 negative, you will be allowed to enter Barbados.
If you arrive in Barbados without being tested, you will be subjected to a mandatory test on arrival at the Concorde Experience facility which is next to the airport. The cost of the test is US$150. You will need to isolate in your accommodation until the test results are provided. This can take a maximum of 48 hours.
Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be taken to a Barbados government quarantine facility at Harrison Point, St Lucy where they will have to remain until they return two consecutive negative COVID test results
Quarantine requirements
The need for mandatory 14 day quarantine will be removed to coincide with the resumption of commercial flights. If you arrive in Barbados without being tested, you will be subjected to a mandatory test on arrival at the Concorde Experience facility which is next to the airport. The cost of the test is US$150. You will need to isolate in your accommodation until the test results are provided. This can take a maximum of 48 hours.

Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa to visit Barbados.
On entry, you will normally be granted a specified period to stay. If you wish to stay longer, you must apply and pay for an extension of stay through the Barbados Immigration Department.
It’s an offence to overstay the entry period or to work without a work permit.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Barbados.
Departure tax
A departure tax of BDS$55 (US$27.50) applies for all passengers over 2 years old leaving Barbados. From 1 October 2018, an additional fee has been added. Passengers flying outside of the Caribbean region pay US$70 per person, and those flying within the Caribbean pay US$35 per person. Most airlines include the cost within the ticket price. If in doubt, you should check with your airline or tour operator.
