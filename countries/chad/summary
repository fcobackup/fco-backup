The FCO advise against all travel to the whole country.

The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to Chad based on the current assessment of security risks given recent events.
The FCDO advises British nationals in Chad to leave the country by commercial means as soon as possible. This change in the level of advice was prompted by an advance south west by armed rebel vehicles past the town of Faya, apparently heading towards N’Djamena.
If you’re planning to return to the UK from Chad, see the Return to the UK section for information on flights and what you’ll need to do to meet UK entry rules before you leave. There are currently commercial means available to return to the UK, but this may change at short notice. Flight connections to the UK can be affected at short notice by COVID-19 restrictions being imposed on countries through which you may need to transit. You are likely to be asked to present a negative COVID-19 test (less than 72 hours old) upon departing Chad.

On Sunday 11 April an armed convoy belonging to the rebel group “Le front pour l’alternance et la concorde au Tchad” (FACT) crossed into Chad from Libya, and engaged in fighting with government security forces. On Saturday 17 April, the rebel convoy moved south west, passing the town of Faya. The convoy appears to be heading towards the capital, N’Djamena. Additionally, a separate FACT convoy has been seen approaching the town of Mao from the north.
