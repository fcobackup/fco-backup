Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will be assigned a case worker who will monitor you until you recover. You will need to remain in your room/accommodation until you have two consecutive negative test results. If your condition is more serious, you will be transferred to a hospital.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
