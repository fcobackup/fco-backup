Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Pakistan.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Pakistan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Pakistan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Pakistan High Commission in London or nearest Pakistani consulate.
Passport validity requirements 
To enter Pakistan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date of your visa application.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry.
Leaving Pakistan will be difficult if you do not have an entry stamp. If your passport was not stamped on entry, contact the Ministry of Interior or visit a National Database and Registration Office (NDRA) office.
Illegal entry to Pakistan is a serious offence. If you enter without the correct documentation you may be detained or deported. If you enter Pakistan illegally, you may not be able to travel onward from Pakistan.
Visa requirements 
You need a visa to visit Pakistan and you must apply in advance.
Applying for a visa
See information on visa categories and how to apply.
Visas for journalists often have extra travel restrictions. Follow the terms of your visa, or you could be fined or detained. 
You can also apply for visa extensions.
Returning to the UK 
You must have an unexpired visa, a Pakistani national identity card or a Pakistani passport to leave Pakistan. 
If your visa has expired, apply online for an exit permit from within Pakistan before attempting to travel.
If you do not have evidence of Pakistani nationality and you entered without a visa, contact the Ministry of Interior or visit a NADRA office.
Citizens of Pakistan overseas 
The National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP) or Smart National Identity Card Overseas Pakistanis (SNICOP), are issued to citizens of Pakistan who are not resident in Pakistan. If you hold either, you will be recognised as a citizen of Pakistan. You can enter Pakistan without a visa and stay for an unlimited period. See how to apply for Pakistani identity cards.
Travelling with children 
If you’re travelling with a child as a single parent or are not the child’s parent, you may need to provide documentary evidence of parental responsibility before leaving Pakistan. This is particularly likely if the child is of Pakistani origin. 
Crossing land borders
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against travel to most of the Pakistan-Afghanistan and Pakistan-Iran border areas. FCDO advises against all travel to Afghanistan and Iran.  
Pakistan-Afghanistan border 
All borders with Afghanistan can close at short notice. There has been overcrowding and violence at open border crossings. 
If entering Pakistan via the Torkham border crossing with Afghanistan you will need a valid Pakistan visa.
Vaccine requirements  
To enter Pakistan, you must have certificates to prove you’ve had:  
a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk
a polio vaccine, in some circumstances
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Pakistan guide.  
Health screening
Mpox 
In response to the recent international mpox outbreaks, travellers may experience enhanced screening and preventive measures, including testing, on entry to Pakistan.

Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods that you can take into and out of Pakistan. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
Alcohol and pork 
Importing alcohol or pork products is illegal. You could be detained if you try to import them.
