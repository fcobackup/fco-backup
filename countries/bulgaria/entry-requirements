Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bulgaria
Bulgaria has a system for classifying travellers arriving in the country based on travel from green, orange and red zones. The UK has been categorised as a ‘red zone’ country.
UK nationals (and their family members) travelling directly from the UK, a European Union member state, a European Economic Area country or Switzerland (even if that country is also in the red zone) are eligible to enter Bulgaria, but you must provide the following pieces of COVID-19 documentation in order to be allowed entry:
a vaccination certificate (Bulgaria will accept either certificate of completion of a two dose vaccine course (Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Novavax, Moderna, Covishield, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Sputnik) or a certificate of receipt of a one dose vaccine (Janssen, Johnson & Johnson). In both cases immunization must have been completed 14 days prior to arrival; or
evidence of past COVID-19 infection (a test result certificate, in English, showing a positive test result from either a PCR or rapid antigen test dated at least 11 days, but no more than 180 days, before arrival in Bulgaria).
You must also provide:
a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours before entry - this should include name, date of birth, details of the medical institution and date and time of the sample, and should be in English.
Children under 12 are exempt from quarantine and the requirement to present COVID-19 documents upon their arrival in Bulgaria, regardless of what colour zone they have travelled from.
From 19 January 2022, children aged 12 to 18 must either:
Present a negative PCR test taken up to 72 hours before entering Bulgaria. This is regardless of nationality and/or residence or colour zone of the country they are travelling from.
Or, if they do not have a negative PCR test, they must self-isolate upon arrival for 10 days. This 10-day self-isolation period can be shortened if they take a PCR test no earlier than 72 hours after their arrival in Bulgaria and the result is negative. The self-isolation requirement will be lifted the day following the registration of the negative result.The self-isolation requirement will be lifted the day following the registration of the negative result.
Bulgarian nationals and permanent and long-term residents, as well as their family members who present only one of the above listed documents – a certificate of vaccination or recovery or a negative PCR test, are allowed to travel but, must self-isolate for 10 days upon arrival. This 10-day quarantine period can be shortened if they perform a PCR test no earlier than 72 hours after their arrival in Bulgaria. If the result is negative, quarantine will be lifted from the day following the registration of the result.
Bulgarian nationals and permanent and long-term residents, as well as their family members who do not present any of the above listed documents – a certificate of vaccination or recovery or a negative PCR test, will be allowed to enter Bulgaria. However, they will be required to complete a mandatory 10-day quarantine which cannot be ended early through testing.
Only Bulgarian nationals and permanent and long-term residents, as well as their family members, will be allowed to enter from the following countries: South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Eswatini and Zimbabwe. They will be subject to a mandatory 10-day self-isolation and a mandatory antigen testing upon entry.

Family members are defined by Bulgaria’s immigration rules, depending on whether the UK nationals are beneficiaries of the Withdrawal Agreement or not.
Family members of a UK national, legally resident in Bulgaria before 31 December 2020, are considered to be:
Husband, Wife or common law partner
Children under 18. This includes stepchildren of either parent and those adopted. Can also include older children up to 21 years old who are in full time education
There are also provisions under the rules for other family members who are normally part of the household who are reliant on the resident or Bulgarian national for care and/or accommodation
Family members of a UK national, legally resident in Bulgaria after 31 December 2020 and therefore not a beneficiary of the Withdrawal Agreement, are considered to be:

It is advisable to bring documentation to demonstrate the family relationship. Family members travelling separately may be turned away without documentary proof.
The measures are in force at all air, road, rail and sea border crossings into Bulgaria.
Exemptions, regardless of nationality, to the entry restrictions in Bulgaria for travellers from UK (and other red list countries) include medical workers, state officials and diplomats, persons traveling for humanitarian reasons, seasonal and tourist workers etc. Other categories of people who can enter Bulgaria without the need to submit documents for COVID-19 include: bus and lorry drivers, crews of vessels and aircraft, border workers, those transiting through the country, students who live in Greece, Turkey, Serbia, Romania or The Republic of North Macedonia and travel daily or at least once a week to Bulgaria for training purposes, travellers between Bulgaria and Romania and between Bulgaria and Czech Republic.
Further information on the full range of exemptions, and the list of countries falling into the green, orange and red zones, is available on the following Bulgarian Government web site (in Bulgarian). If you fall into one of the exempted categories, you should contact your travel operator in advance of travel for further information on how to demonstrate your exemption from the travel ban.
Many land borders crossings in the region are restricted or closed for passenger traffic. Furthermore, neighbouring countries are implementing additional health requirements for entry to or departure from Bulgaria including declarations and COVID-19 tests. You should check the relevant FCDO Travel Advice.
If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before you travel.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Bulgaria will accept the UK’s NHS vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 recovery issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Quarantine requirements
If you need to self-isolate on arrival to Bulgaria and are eligible to shorten this, please check the list of places offering PCR testing in Bulgaria. It is available here in Bulgarian.
You should submit the document showing a negative result of the PCR test to the respective Regional Health Inspectorate.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
From 1 January 2021, the rules for travelling or working in European countries changed:
you can travel to Bulgaria for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit for family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day limit in Bulgaria as it is not in the Schengen area. Visits to Bulgaria do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Bulgarian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Bulgarian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Bulgaria with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
*any time you spent in Bulgaria before 1 January 2021 does not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit.
At Bulgarian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Bulgaria. If you are resident in Bulgaria, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Bulgaria guide.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Bulgaria.
