There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Djibouti as the Government of Djibouti suspended all commercial flights in and out of Djibouti and closed the borders.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Djibouti. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Djiboutian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Spaces on charter flights organised by other countries are sometimes available to British Nationals. We will keep this page up to date with options as they become available.
There is no British Embassy in Djibouti. The nearest British Embassy is in Addis Ababa. If you are currently in Djibouti and would like to return to the UK, you should email returnfromEthiopia@fco.gov.uk with:
name
email address
mobile telephone number
location
any other relevant information.
This email address is only for those expressing an interest in travelling back to the UK. It is not for consular assistance. British nationals requiring consular assistance should call +251 (0)11 617 0100, or from the UK 0207 008 1500. Please also subscribe to our travel advice.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you cannot leave Djibouti, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
