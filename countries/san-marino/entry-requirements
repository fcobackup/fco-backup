This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in San Marino set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the San Marino Consulate in the UK. 
Travelling through Italy
You will need to travel through Italy to enter San Marino. Read Italy travel advice before you visit. 
COVID-19 rules 
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering San Marino. 
Passport validity requirements 
San Marino follows Schengen area rules. Your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to. 
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
You do not need to pass through border controls to enter San Marino, but you must have a passport containing a valid entry stamp from a Schengen area country. 
Visa requirements 
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area and San Marino for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
The requirements for working in San Marino are different. Contact the San Marino Consulate in the UK for more information.
If you’re travelling to other Schengen area countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
Registering with the police 
You must go to the Gendarmerie to register and get a permit of stay if you are visiting for more than 30 days or are planning to work. Check the San Marino Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for more information. 
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s San Marino guide.   
Customs rules 
The rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of San Marino are the same as for Italy. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
