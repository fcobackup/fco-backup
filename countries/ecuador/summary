There have been extensive protests across Ecuador since 3 October following new economic measures announced by the Government on 1 October. This has caused nationwide disruption, with demonstrations and road blockages in many provinces. A State of Emergency was declared on 3 October and remains in place. The Armed Forces announced a curfew on 8 October, restricting access between 20:00 and 05:00 in the Historic Centre in Quito and in other areas of strategic importance across Ecuador, including ports, airports, Government buildings and energy infrastructure. Official documents will be required for access to ports and airports within these times. You should ensure that you comply with the requirements of the emergency measures. Military personnel have been deployed nationwide, and security forces have used tear gas to disperse crowds. Further large-scale demonstrations are expected over the next few days, especially in the Andean region. The President has moved the seat of government from the capital to Guayaquil.
In particular, a major indigenous protest is taking place in Quito on 9 October. You should avoid all demonstrations, as some have turned violent. The Historic Centre in Quito is a particular focus for protests on 9 October, and it is likely that these will be violent.
Given the extensive disruption to travel across Ecuador since 3 October, and the likelihood that this may continue, travellers should consider carefully the practicalities of their travel plans. You should avoid inter-city travel by land where possible. Allow extra time to reach your destination and check travel plans regularly - you may need to change your plans. If your travel is affected by roadblocks, remain where you are until you have identified a safe route and means to travel. National supply chains are also being affected. You should ensure you have adequate essential supplies (food, water, fuel and medicine).
Monitor official sources via the ECU 911 emergency services - be wary of unverified, unofficial information. Updates on transport disruption are available on the ECU 911 website, from the Municipal Transport Agency for Quito and the Municipal Transport Agency for Guayaquil. If you need urgent consular assistance, contact the British Embassy Quito on +593 (0)2 397 2200.
Some international flights have been affected in recent days. Intermittent access to Quito International Airport has resulted in some cancellations and delays to domestic and international flights. You should check your flight status with your airline before travelling to the airport. For live updates on all flights, monitor the Quito International Airport and Guayaquil International Airport websites (in Spanish).
Around 30,210 British nationals visited Ecuador in 2018. Most visits are trouble free.
