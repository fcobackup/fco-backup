Disruption and ongoing protests
There is significant unrest across Mozambique which is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Protests can be violent and occur at short notice. Police have used live ammunition, leading to civilians being killed and injured. There are increased incidents of criminality including looting, break-ins, and robberies.
If you are in Mozambique, seek local advice and monitor the local media. Avoid large gatherings or demonstrations, pay attention to your surroundings and avoid travelling after dark.
Roads, routes to airports and border crossings can quickly be restricted, blocked or closed, affecting services and transport nationwide.
Travel insurance
If you choose to travel, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
