This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Saudi Arabia as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Saudi Arabia to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Saudi Arabia
You should monitor announcements issued by the Saudi Ministry of Health and Ministry of Interior for any updates.
Authorities in Saudi Arabia have introduced:
a daily curfew and prohibition of movement. Hours of curfew and areas where movement is restricted vary depending on your location and can change at short notice. A list of exceptions is available from the Saudi Ministry of Health
domestic travel restrictions, including the temporary suspension of all domestic flights, buses, some taxi services and trains from 21 March
Measures also include:
restrictions on the operations of commercial markets and malls, with the exception of pharmacies and food supply stores such as supermarkets and hypermarkets.
services in restaurants and cafes limited to take away and delivery requests only
restrictions on gatherings in public places
a temporary suspension on entry and prayer in the outer courtyards of the Two Holy Mosques in Mecca and Medina
Visas
Visit Saudi has announced that the period of international flight suspension shall not count towards the overall duration of any issued tourist visa and its associated insurance policy. This applies to visa holders who have not yet used their tourist visas, as well as those who were in the country at the time of the suspension.
Health
Twenty-five hospitals have been designated to treat patients with coronavirus. The Ministry of Health has a dedicated call centre (937) available 24/7 for residents and citizens to utilise in case of any enquiries regarding coronavirus.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Saudi Arabia, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
