There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Uzbekistan. All commercial flights in and out of the country have been suspended.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Uzbekistan. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Uzbek authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you cannot leave Uzbekistan at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
Future travel options
There is a possibility of a special commercial flight from Dushanbe to Frankfurt in the near future. Further details (including date, time and cost of tickets) are not yet known and it is likely that if this flight goes ahead, timings will be confirmed at short notice. Those wishing to depart on this flight may register their interest by emailing the British Embassy at: StayInContact.UZBEKISTAN@fco.gov.uk – please note that British nationals can use this address to inform the Embassy of their presence in Uzbekistan.
It is unclear if potential passengers from Uzbekistan will be allowed to cross the Uzbekistan-Tajikistan border, nor is it clear what the travel arrangements from Tashkent to Dushanbe might be. This is something the British Embassy are looking into and will provide an update, once known, through social media channels: (Facebook and Twitter).
It is important to note that the German authorities will require evidence of onward travel from Frankfurt to final destination(s) and it will be passengers’ responsibility to arrange this. Please also refer to FCO Travel Advice for Germany.
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Uzbek authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
