Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Falkland Islands
Current visitor restrictions mean tourists are not permitted to visit the Falkland Islands, including via cruise vessels. Friends of residents are permitted to visit if sponsored by an Island resident who is present in the Falkland Islands at the time of arrival. These visitors will be subject to the same quarantine requirements as all other visitors.
Quarantine requirements
Any entrants into the Falkland Islands are expected to self-isolate and to be swabbed for Covid-19 on or before day 2 and on day 8 after their arrival in the Islands. If both tests are negative, they will be able to leave quarantine. Quarantine will otherwise last for 14 days. If you develop symptoms after arrival which makes you a suspect case, you should call the hospital on 28000 for advice if you need medical help.
A suspect case is a person with a fever and a cough or shortness of breath, if there is no other explanation for those symptoms.
