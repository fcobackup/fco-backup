Travel in Switzerland
The Swiss government have now ended their “extraordinary situation” in response to coronavirus (COVID-19), but some measures remain in place. All contact with other individuals should be at a distance of at least 1.5 metres.
Wearing a face mask is compulsory when travelling on public transport. Failure to do so is punishable by a fine. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from this requirement. Wearing face masks is also compulsory when attending demonstrations.
Swiss cantons may impose further restrictions and you should check cantonal websites before travelling.
Public spaces and services
All shops, restaurants, markets, museums and libraries are now able to reopen with social distancing measures in place. Restaurants are able to accommodate groups of more than four people. Events of up to 1000 people are permitted.
