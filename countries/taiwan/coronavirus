Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Taiwan on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
When COVID levels in Taiwan were very low, every positive case was hospitalised, even in asymptomatic cases. Following the recent spike in cases, the approach is to hospitalise serious cases and admit less serious, including asymptomatic cases, into central quarantine facilities.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Taiwan.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Pre-Departure COVID-19 PCR Testing
Passengers travelling to the UK from Taiwan will be required to undertake a COVID-19 PCR test in the 3 days before their scheduled flight departs. Any individuals who receive a positive PCR test will not be permitted to board the aircraft and will instead be required to complete a mandatory 14 day quarantine in Taiwan. Individuals with mild symptoms will be admitted into a quarantine hotel or a centralised quarantine centre for this duration. Any individuals with more severe symptoms may be hospitalised. This applies to all nationalities and age groups and is irrespective of the purpose of their intended travel. The decision regarding these arrangements will be made by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and on a case by case basis.
Any individuals who receive a positive COVID-19 PCR test will be contacted by their local health bureau to advise on their mandatory quarantine arrangements. Visit the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control website or contact their helpline on 1922 for further information.
For passengers travelling with children, you should check with your airline before you travel regarding the COVID-19 test requirements.
Further information regarding centralised quarantine centres can be found in the ‘Entry Requirements’ section.

Travel in Taiwan
Although there is no lockdown in place, the authorities are encouraging people to limit travel between cities and regions to reduce the risk of COVID spread.
Taxis and public transport systems are operating normally in Taiwan. The wearing of face masks is mandatory on all public transport. If you use public transport and are not wearing a face mask, you may be fined up to NT$15,000.
Accommodation
From 27 June 2021, all passengers arriving directly from eight designated countries, including the UK, or those who have been in one of these countries in the preceding 14 days, are required to complete their mandatory 14 day quarantine at a designated quarantine facility. This is due to concern about the Delta variant.
All passengers will be required to have two COVID-19 PCR tests, one on arrival in Taiwan and the other at the end of their quarantine period. A further self-administered rapid COVID-19 test will be required between the 10th and 12th day of their quarantine. They must test negative for COVID-19 at the end of the quarantine period to be allowed out of quarantine. The costs of staying in the designated quarantine facilities and two COVID-19 PCR tests will be paid for by the Taiwan authorities.
An additional 7 day self-health management period is required for all passengers who have completed their quarantine.
Passengers arriving into Taiwan from anywhere else will be required to complete their mandatory 14 day quarantine at a quarantine hotel or a designated quarantine facility and will be required to pay for this.
In no circumstances will travellers arriving into Taiwan be able to quarantine in their own residence.
See Entry requirements for more information.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Taiwan
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country/territory where they live. We will update this page when the Taiwanese authorities announce new information on their vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Taiwan vaccination programme started in March 2021 and is using the AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines. British nationals resident in Taiwan are eligible for vaccination.
The Taiwanese authorities have released an online reservation system for booking a COVID-19 vaccination appointment in Taiwan. Foreign nationals who hold an Alien Resident Card (ARC) and National Health Insurance (NHI) card will be required to complete an online form and provide their contact information to register. Foreign nationals who do not hold a National Health Insurance card will be required to provide their ARC UI number and passport number in order to register. The local health department in the applicant’s area will contact the individual once an appointment has been scheduled. Vaccine priority groups and other criteria will apply.
The Taiwan Ministry of Labour has prepared an English guide on how to book a COVID-19 vaccination through the official vaccination reservation platform.
In light of the increase of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases in Taiwan, the local authorities have announced that reservations for self-paid coronavirus vaccinations for overseas travel purposes, have been suspended until further notice. However, any individuals who received their first COVID-19 vaccination in the self-paid programme between 21 April 2021 and 9 May 2021, will be able to receive their second vaccine dose after 10 to 12 weeks.
Visit the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control website for further information on the vaccine roll-out in Taiwan.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Taiwan, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
