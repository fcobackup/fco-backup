For stays of less than 90 days you can drive with a UK photocard driving licence. For longer stays or if you only have a paper licence, you need an international driving permit (IDP).
Drink-driving laws are strict in Norway. The legal alcohol limit is one quarter of the UK’s legal limit. There are frequent roadside checks for alcohol. Penalties for driving under the influence are severe and include prison sentences.
Car drivers must use winter tyres with a minimum 3 millimetre (mm) tread if there is snow or ice covering the roads. You may also need to use studded tyres or snow chains. Truck drivers must use winter tyres with a minimum 5mm tread and have a sufficient number of snow chains.
You can get the full tyre requirements from Norway’s State Highways.
Keep your headlights on, but dipped, during the daytime all year round in all places.
On roads that are not marked with a priority sign (yellow diamond), you must give way to traffic coming from the right.
If you commit a driving offence, you could get an on-the-spot fine of up to 10,000 Norwegian krone.
