The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
COVID-19: Arrival in Japan
From 0001 on 21 March (Japan Standard Time), all passengers arriving in Japan from the UK, as well as countries listed in the Health section, are required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival at a designated location (such as a hotel or your own home) and to avoid using public transport. These measures do not apply to passengers who are transiting and do not go through immigration. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should also check the latest entry requirements for your destination.
From 0001 on 21 March (Japan Standard Time) until the end of April, Japan will suspend the visa waiver system for anyone travelling on a British Citizen or British National (Overseas) passport. Japan will also suspend single and multiple entry visas issued by Japanese Embassies and Consulate Generals in the UK and those countries to which self-isolation measures apply (listed in the Health section). Anyone arriving in Japan after 0001 on 21 March without a visa will not be able to enter. Those already in Japan can remain until their visa waiver expires. Those who still wish to travel to Japan can apply for a visa, but this is likely to take more time than usual. Please check with your nearest Japanese Embassy or Consulate General for further details.
These measures will not impact on the ‘Status of Residence’ of British nationals already living in Japan. However, British nationals who are living in Japan and are currently outside of Japan with re-entry permission will be able to return, unless they have travelled to any of the countries or regions to which an entry ban applies in the 14 days prior to returning. Those are listed in the Health section.
You are advised to contact your airline or tour operator before you travel, including for updates in relation to cancelled flights. Those who want to return to the UK soon should take account of the fast moving situation and plan accordingly.
If you are concerned that you may overstay as a result of flight cancellations due to COVID-19 restrictions, you should contact Japan’s Immigration Services Agency on +81 570 013 904 or +81 357 967 112.
Visas
If you have a different type of British nationality, or you wish to enter Japan for other purposes (long-term stay, study, settlement, employment); if you have any doubts about whether you’re eligible to enter Japan (eg, if you have a criminal record or have been arrested even if it did not result in a conviction) or about visa matters generally, contact a Japanese Embassy or Consulate. Visas aren’t issued after arrival in Japan.
It’s illegal to work in Japan without the correct visa, however informal or temporary the work. Don’t overstay your permission to remain in the country, otherwise you risk arrest, detention and a heavy fine.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Japan.
Medication
The use or possession of some common prescription and over-the-counter medicines are banned under Japan’s strictly enforced anti-stimulant drugs law. This includes Vicks inhalers, medicines for allergies and sinus problems, cold and flu medication containing Pseudoephedrine and even some over-the-counter painkillers like those containing codeine. Foreign nationals have been detained and deported for offences - ignorance may not be considered a defence. You should check the status of your medication with the nearest Japanese Embassy or Consulate before you travel.
If you’re travelling with prescription medication that is permitted under Japanese law, you’re normally allowed to bring in up to one month’s supply. You’re advised to bring a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating the medical condition that the medication has been prescribed to treat. For more guidance on travelling with medication, check information pages from NHS Choices and the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) in our foreign travel checklist.
If you need prescription medicine for long term use, you may need to provide extra paperwork, such as an import licence. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare provides information about bringing medication for personal use.
