The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
All commercial and charter flights are suspended from entering or leaving Cuba until 31 July 2020, and this date may be subject to further review. No foreign sea vessels are allowed in Cuban waters until further notice. On sea vessels, there may be exceptions made by Cuban authorities on the grounds of health, fuel or technical problems.
Only Cuban nationals and foreign residents of Cuba are allowed to enter Cuba, and will be put in government-managed self-isolation accommodation for 14 days. Returning residents are taken to their province of residence for quarantine.
Under the government’s phased recovery plan, the rules on entry are:
no foreign visitors allowed to enter the country now or when a Province is in phase 1;
from 1 July, tourists will be allowed to come to Cuba again with international charter flights directly to these destinations: Cayo Coco, Cayo Cruz or Cayo Guillermo (served by Jardines del Rey airport); Cayo Santa Maria (flying into Santa Clara airport), or Cayo Largo del Sur. Tour operators can start selling these holidays now, with luggage limits of one case of up to 32kgs per passenger plus hand luggage, Everyone will be tested on arrival (a ‘PCR’ swab and a temperature test) and will be transferred directly to their resorts. Anyone that has a positive test result will be transferred to a hospital;
in the last phase, tourists will be allowed to enter on any flight to Cuba.
Currently all Provinces are in the first group mentioned above, therefore no tourists can enter Cuba. There is no fixed date for when a Province will move to the next phase.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the Cuban immigration authorities or the nearest Cuban Embassy/Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
If coming to Cuba, you should pack sanitary hand gel, handkerchiefs and other essential items that may prevent transmission, as these items are not always available in Cuba.

Travelling to Cuba from the USA
Travelling for tourism reasons directly from the USA to Cuba isn’t allowed under US law. The law applies to US nationals and all foreign nationals who are either resident in the USA, or travelling through the USA en route to Cuba. Those travelling on direct flights between the UK and Cuba, or via other countries excluding the USA, are unaffected by this US legislation.
Under certain conditions, travel is permitted from the USA to Cuba, including on the direct flights which operate between the two countries. Everybody travelling on these routes (both US citizens and foreign nationals) will need to comply with US law and travel for one of 12 permitted reasons/categories of travel. Tourism isn’t one of these 12 permitted reasons/categories. For more information see the US Department of the Treasury website and the US State Department’s travel advice for Cuba. For travel-specific questions, see the Code of Federal Regulations 31 C.F.R. 515.560 and the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) frequently asked questions.
