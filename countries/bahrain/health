At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus in China, but cases have been confirmed in some other countries, including Bahrain.

The government of Bahrain is temporarily preventing entry to all foreign nationals who have visited Iran, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea 14 days prior to their arrival in Bahrain. As well as suspending all flights arriving from Dubai International Airport and Sharjah International Airport for a period of 48 hours from 24 February. These restrictions may be subject to change. If you have concerns, you should contact your airline to confirm your travel plans before departure. For British citizens in Bahrain, you should follow the advice of the authorities including a local hotline of 444 which you can call from your mobile telephone should you have concerns about your health.
