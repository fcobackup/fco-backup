This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Tanzania set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Tanzania before travel.
All passengers arriving in Tanzania will be required to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate upon arrival. The test should be taken within 96 hours of arrival in Tanzania. All passengers travelling to Tanzania must complete an online Traveller’s Surveillance Form. This form must be submitted no more than 24 hours before arrival.
All passengers entering Tanzania will be subjected to enhanced screening for COVID-19 including a mandatory rapid test. The cost for rapid testing is 10 USD per traveller for arrivals in mainland Tanzania and 25 USD for arrivals in Zanzibar. The fee can be paid for through the online Traveller Surveillance Form or in cash on arrival.
Children 5 years and under are exempt from both pre-departure PCR tests and rapid tests on arrival.
The Government of Tanzania is also implementing temperature scanning for all international passengers arriving into Tanzania.

Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of your arrival in Tanzania.
Visas
All British passport holders need a tourist or business visa to enter Tanzania. Tanzania has introduced an ‘e-visas’ system through which applications can be submitted and approved online in advance of travel. It is no longer possible to get a visa from the Tanzanian High Commission in London.
It is also possible to get a tourist or business visa for a single entry on arrival at main ports of entry to Tanzania, subject to the fulfilment of all immigration requirements. You may be asked to provide proof of your return journey. You will not be able to get a multiple entry visa on arrival. For further information about visas visit the Tanzanian immigration website.
If you are planning to work or volunteer, you will need a valid work permit which can also be applied for online via the Tanzanian immigration website. Your employer or volunteer organisation should arrange this before you travel.
If you overstay the validity of your visa or permit you can be arrested, detained and fined before being deported. Reports made to the British High Commission by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) British passport holders have indicated that they are experiencing additional levels of harassment from immigration officials. In these circumstances, you should stay calm and request that the Consular section of the British High Commission is immediately informed.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents, with a minimum of six months’ validity, are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Tanzania.
