The COVID-19 global pandemic has greatly reduced travel routes between Brazil and the UK.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Brazil, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
Commercial flight options
Direct commercial flights to the UK are available with LATAM, currently flying every Tuesday and Friday from Sao Paulo Guarulhos to London Heathrow. There are a number of scheduled indirect flights via mainland Europe or the US.
The following airlines are operating indirect routes back to the UK from Brazil:
Air France
KLM
Lufthansa
TAP
All four of these airlines are operating from Sao Paulo. KLM, TAP and Air France also operate from Rio’s Galeao airport. Other options may be available. Details are subject to change and there could be travel restrictions if you are connecting. The US has introduced a ban on entry to the US of non-resident travellers that have been to Brazil fourteen days prior to the arrival in the US. Check directly with your airline.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travel to your international airport
There may be restrictions on public transit to airports. Check locally before you travel and allow additional time to reach airports.
Domestic flights
Some domestic flights are also being impacted by travel restrictions and cancellations due to reduced demand. You’re advised to book domestic connecting flights on the same ticket as your international flight to the UK, and to allow longer than usual for international connections.
Some passengers have experienced cancellations that have added up to 24 hour delays to their domestic flights. You should also check the status of your flight regularly so that you can rebook an earlier departure if your domestic connecting flight is cancelled.
Road
Some states have put in place restrictions on interstate travel and the situation could change quickly. Check with your tour operator or car hire rental firm before making your journey. Check the Safety and security section of this travel advice for more information on travel by road in Brazil.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If you cannot leave Brazil
If you cannot leave Brazil at this time, see advice on staying in Brazil during coronavirus.
