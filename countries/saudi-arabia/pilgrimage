Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Saudi Arabia.

Many British nationals travel to Saudi Arabia each year for Umrah or Hajj pilgrimage.
Entry requirements for pilgrimage  
You should also read the main section on Entry requirements.
You can apply for an e-visa or electronic visa waiver to perform Umrah outside of the Hajj season.
You can only book a Hajj place through the official Nusuk Hajj platform.
Health risks and vaccine requirements  
You must have a valid certificate of vaccination against the ACWY strains of meningitis 10 days before arriving for Hajj and Umrah. For more information on health risks and vaccination requirements, read the TravelHealthPro Hajj and Umrah guide.
Check Health for advice on bringing medicines into Saudi Arabia. Make sure you have enough medication for your entire trip, including if your return is delayed.
Contagious diseases spread quickly, particularly during Hajj and Ramadan. Flu, colds and respiratory problems are common.
Prepare for extreme heat. During the summer months, the temperature may exceed 50°C. Consume enough liquids and avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight.
Scams 
UK-based organised crime groups target people planning Hajj or Umrah trips. Criminals pick people of any age, gender or location for their scams. Many victims are over the age of 65.  
To avoid scams: 
be aware you can only book a Hajj place on the Nusuk Hajj platform
check Saudi Ministry of Hajj information for the procedures you must follow
make sure your travel agent or operator is ATOL protected when booking Umrah
research the travel company before you book, even if family or friends recommended it
be wary of offers too good to be true – criminals advertise fraudulent deals through licensed travel companies
Paying for trips 
When paying for your Hajj or Umrah visit: 
use a credit card where possible
have an audit trail and keep a record of any transactions
get everything confirmed in writing
always ask for written terms and conditions
Reporting fraud  
If you have been a victim of Hajj fraud in the UK, contact: 
your local police
City of London Police Fraud Desk
Action Fraud
