The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you are travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you are unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Under Montenegrin law you must carry a valid form of ID with you at all times, for example a driving licence, passport or equivalent, otherwise you may be fined. Keep a photocopy of your passport in a safe place.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and borders
Montenegrin nationals and foreigners with Montenegrin residence permits, and those driving freight vehicles, are permitted to enter Montenegro. Holders of Montenegrin residence permits entering Montenegro should expect to be subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine in state-arranged accommodation.
The Montenegrin Government has re-opened its borders to residents of certain European countries that meet an epidemiological criterion of 25 or fewer coronavirus cases per 100,000 population) without a requirement for testing prior to entry. Countries currently on this list are Slovenia, Iceland, Croatia, Slovakia, Switzerland, Albania, Austria, Norway, Monaco, Kosovo, Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia, Azerbaijan, Luxembourg, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Israel, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Albania and Greece, Republic of Ireland, Finland and Estonia. This list does not include travellers from the United Kingdom but should not exclude UK citizens resident in and travelling from countries on the list above.
The list is scheduled to be updated every week from 1 June.
All international passenger rail services are currently suspended. International road, maritime and air traffic is only operating with countries that meet an epidemiological criterion of 25 or fewer coronavirus cases per 100,000 population. Non-commercial air transport (general aviation) is exempt from this ban. This exemption allows non-commercial aircraft of up to 10 seats to enter Montenegro. Crew members and passengers need to have a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, taken within the previous 48 hours. Full details of the exemption are on the Montenegrin Government website.
Border crossings with the Republic of Serbia are now open for entry from Montenegro. Commercial flights between London and Belgrade have resumed, though schedules are likely to remain subject to change at short notice. Please check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details.
Quarantine restrictions
All those entering Montenegro, except for residents from the countries listed above, should expect to be subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine in state-arranged accommodation. Additional measures may be imposed. Individuals who have had contact with someone diagnosed with coronavirus, or suspected to be infected with coronavirus will be subject to quarantine.
All those who were quarantined or self-isolating and who test positive for the coronavirus and are unable to continue self-isolation in their place of residence will be subjected to compulsory institutional isolation. The same rule applies for those who have received hospital treatment for coronavirus and recovered but have not passed two sequential negative coronavirus results; and to those who arrived in Montenegro from abroad and subsequently tested positive for the coronavirus.
You should comply with any additional screening and other measures put in place by the authorities to monitor and limit the spread of the virus. Violation of these measures is a criminal offence. Additional measures may be introduced at short notice.
Visas
Expired permanent and temporary residence permits and temporary work permits will remain valid for foreigners until 1 July.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You can enter Montenegro for short-term stays of up to 90 days without a visa. The Montenegrin law considers “stays of 90 days” as 90 days in total in a 180-day period, counted from the first entry date.
On entering Montenegro, make sure the border police put an entry stamp in your passport. This helps avoid problems related to verifying the length of your stay in the country.
If you are in the UK and you would like to consult if and what type of Montenegrin visa you need before you travel, contact the Montenegrin Embassy in London.
If you wish to extend your stay once in Montenegro, you will need to apply for a visa or a temporary residence permit from the Montenegrin Ministry of Interior Affairs no later than one week before the 90-day period expires.
Passport validity
Your passport should be undamaged and in accordance with local law should be issued in the last 10 years and valid for at least 3 months after your planned date of departure from Montenegro.
If you hold dual citizenship, the Montenegrin authorities will consider you a citizen of the issuing state of the passport with which you entered Montenegro.
Border crossings
Only enter Montenegro through recognised border crossings.
If you are planning a mountaineering tour which involves crossing borders other than at an official border crossing point, contact the National Tourist Organisation for advice.
There may be additional delays on roads approaching the border crossings between Montenegro and neighbouring countries, given coronavirus-related restrictions.
Entry is currently forbidden to all foreign nationals except for those with permanent or temporary residence permits in Montenegro, and those driving freight vehicles. See Staying during Coronavirus section for further details.
Registration
By law you must register with the local police or tourism organisation in the town/city where you are staying within 24 hours of your arrival in Montenegro, unless you are staying in a hotel or other commercial accommodation where you’ll be registered automatically on checking in.
If you do not register you may be fined, detained or face a court appearance.
Customs requirements
The Montenegro Customs Administration advises travellers of the main regulations regarding import of food, medicines, flora and fauna species, animals, tobacco and alcoholic beverages and firearms, in their downloadable guide.
Although there is no limit to the amount of money you can bring into Montenegro, you should declare sums of money in excess of €10,000 (including travellers’ cheques or equivalent in other currencies). To take more than €10,000 out of the country you will need to provide proof that you brought the money in. Customs Officers at all border points issue declaration forms. On departure, you will need to return a certified copy of this declaration to customs. For sums of money in excess of €15,000 you should also have obtained a document which states the origin of the funds. If you fail to comply with these rules, your money may be confiscated.
To avoid customs charges, declare items of value like expensive jewellery, photographic and computer equipment.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted by Montenegrin authorities for entry, airside transit and exit from Montenegro and are valid forms of identity documents in Montenegro.
