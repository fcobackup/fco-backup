Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Côte d’Ivoire
Biometric in-person visa services at the Côte d’Ivoire Embassy in London are suspended due to COVID-19. Anyone wishing to enter Côte d’Ivoire who does not already have a visa should make their visa application through the e-visa service online before travel, available in English. If you are not an ECOWAS national, you must hold a valid visa or have had your application for an e-visa approved for Côte d’Ivoire before you travel.
After registering and paying online, you’ll be able to collect your visa on arrival at Abidjan airport. You’ll need to apply for the e-visa online several days before your date of travel to allow time for your application to be processed. Make sure you follow instructions on the website carefully to avoid any difficulties with airlines or immigration authorities.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Côte d’Ivoire will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Testing / screening for arrivals
If you are arriving in Côte d’Ivoire, you must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result, dated a maximum of 2 days (48 hours) prior to arrival, before being allowed to board your flight. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You’ll also need to complete the DDVA form prior to arrival at a cost of 2000 XOF, available online. You’ll need to hand in this form on arrival and comply with the medical monitoring system which has been put in place by the authorities for anyone arriving in Côte d’Ivoire from outside. This includes providing temperature readings and registering your contact details. If you have a temperature below 38 degrees and a valid negative COVID-19 test result, you may be permitted to enter Côte d’Ivoire. You may be monitored by SMS tracking for 14 days. If you have a temperature high than 38 degrees and/or an invalid COVID-19 test result on arrival, you’ll be required to take a COVID-19 test at your own expense.
Measures are subject to frequent review and may change at short notice, so travellers should check the government’s official site for updates.
