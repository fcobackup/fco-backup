This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Vietnam set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Vietnamese Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Vietnam, your passport must have:
an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive
at least 2 blank pages
no damage – British nationals have been denied entry and exit due to passport damage
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
It is a requirement of Vietnamese authorities that visitors enter and exit Vietnam using the same passport.
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
Check the visa expiry date written in your passport is correct before leaving border control. If it is wrong, you could be accused of overstaying. Your passport is stamped upon entry which will specify the date by which you need to leave Vietnam.
Visa requirements
You can visit Vietnam without a visa for up to 45 days for tourism or business. On arrival, your passport will be stamped with an entry and exit stamp (the date you have to leave by). Check that the date given is 45 days from your arrival date, as Immigration will not change this after you have left the airport/land border.
If you want to stay longer than 45 days, you can:
book with a travel agent in Vietnam and ask them to apply for a visa pre-approval letter – your agent will tell you when to collect your visa from the embassy
apply for other visa types from the Vietnamese Embassy in the UK
apply for an e-visa that allows a 90-day stay and multiple entries
E-visas restrict you to the entry and exit points you select when you apply. If you get an e-visa while in Vietnam, you must exit the country and re-enter to start your e-visa.
The British Embassy will not assist with visa extensions.
Work or study
If you want to work or study, check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Vietnam Immigration Department.
Read about visas and work permits if you live in Vietnam.
If you overstay your visa or work illegally, the authorities can prevent you from leaving until you pay a fine. You could be deported and prevented from visiting Vietnam in the future.
Travelling through Vietnam
If you transfer from an international flight to a domestic flight in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, you must go through immigration and enter Vietnam. You must do this even if your final destination is outside Vietnam. Check with your airline before departing.
Exit requirements
You cannot leave Vietnam without a valid visa and must enter and exit Vietnam using the same passport.
Exit bans
Vietnamese authorities may place an exit ban on certain individuals to prevent them from leaving the country. Your passport will be seized until the case is fully investigated. If you are unable to leave the country because of an exit ban, consult a lawyer and contact your nearest British embassy or consulate.
An exit ban can relate to investigations into: 
an individual, their family or an employer
criminal and civil matters, such as business disputes or motor vehicle accidents 
employment without a work visa
unpaid financial debts
Vaccine requirements

Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Vietnam. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
If you’re taking prescription medication into Vietnam, carry it in your hand luggage with a copy of the prescription. If it has a total import value greater than 100 US dollars, you must declare it at customs. For information about restrictions on medication, see Health.
Taking money into or out of Vietnam
If you’re taking cash into or out of Vietnam, you must declare amounts over:
15 million Vietnamese dong
5,000 US dollars (or the same value in other currencies)
If you’re leaving the country with more than these amounts, declare the money at customs and show either:
confirmation you’re carrying cash abroad, issued by an authorised credit institution
written approval to carry cash, issued by the State Bank of Vietnam
