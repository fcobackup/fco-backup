Crime
Public security is generally good, particularly in Tirana, and Albanians are very hospitable to visitors. Crime and violence does occur in some areas, but reports of crime specifically targeting foreigners are rare. There have been occasional shootings and small explosions, but these appear to be related to internal disputes over criminal, business or political interests.
Landmines
In December 2009 Albania officially declared it had met its  ‘Ottawa Convention Article 5’ obligations and had reached mine-free status. However, when visiting hill towns on the northern border with Kosovo you should take care, particularly if hiking and follow the signs warning about unexploded landmines and other unexploded ordnance. Demining is ongoing on the Kosovo side. 
Road travel
You can drive in Albania with a valid UK driving licence for up to one year. You can also drive in Albania with an International Driving Permit (IDP). You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
If you stay longer than one year, or live in Albania, you will need to apply for an Albanian driving licence.
If you’re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.
Driving can be very hazardous. Roads are poor, especially in rural areas. Street lighting in urban areas is subject to power cuts. Elsewhere, even on the major inter-urban arterial routes, there is no street lighting. If you are travelling at night, watch out for unmarked road works, potholes and unlit vehicles. Four-wheel drive vehicles are often more practical on rural and minor roads.
Albanian driving can often be aggressive and erratic. Deaths from road traffic accidents are amongst the highest in Europe. Police have taken some measures to decrease the number of accidents. Minor traffic disputes can quickly escalate, especially as some motorists could be armed. Avoid reacting to provocative behaviour by other road users. If you are involved in a traffic accident, even a minor one, you are supposed to wait until the police arrive. This will usually happen quickly in built-up areas.
If you are intending to import a vehicle into Albania, make sure you have all the necessary papers on arrival at the border. Consult the Albanian Embassy in London before you leave. The British Embassy will be unable to help anyone attempting to bring a vehicle into Albania without the correct paperwork.
Air travel
The FCO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
A list of incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
In 2014 the International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safely oversight in Albania.
Sea travel
There are some local press reports that jet skis and boats being rented along the coasts may lack adequate safety precautions and equipment.
Swimming
The Albanian National Environment Agency reported in 2016 that 83% of beaches in Albania are of a very good or good standard but the report raised concerns over a small number of beaches including beaches in Durres, Vlore and Saranda which are polluted as a result of inadequate sewage disposal and treatment.
Political situation
Opposition parties have recently held large demonstrations in central Tirana and announced that weekly protests will take place outside Parliament. Demonstrations could occur outside other public buildings. A recent demonstration on 11 May 2019, turned violent, when Molotov cocktails, firecrackers and other hard objects were thrown. The police responded with tear gas. Sporadic protests are also taking place in areas outside the capital. Subsequent large-scale protests and acts of civil disobedience are possible country-wide in the run-up to, during and after local elections due on Sunday 30 June. You should check local media for the latest information, remain vigilant and avoid any demonstrations.
Tension between religious groups and expression of extremist views is very rare, and attitudes to western countries are overwhelmingly positive.
