The UAE suspended all inbound and outbound flights at 11:59pm local time on Tuesday 24 March. There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from the UAE. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting the UAE, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded. You should continue to contact your airline or tour operator regarding any possible return flights. This will ensure any demand is logged in the airlines own assumptions about the number of people waiting to return to the UK. The British Embassy is in constant contact with the local authorities, airlines and other diplomatic missions to explore all possible avenues.
What to do
If you cannot leave the UAE at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British Embassy on 04 309 4444 or 02 610 1100.
The Embassy cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This page will be updated when departure options become available. To get the latest information, sign up for travel advice email alerts
Visas
The Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship have confirmed that visitors to the UAE who could not leave the country due to border closures will receive necessary support such as permissions to stay legitimately in the country. A specific mechanism will be announced in the coming days. They have also announced fines will not be applied to those overstaying on a UAE-issued visa due to coronavirus. Find out more on the ICA website.
If you have any questions on the validity or expiry of your visa, contact UAE Immigration directly. If you’re living outside the UAE, contact the nearest UAE Embassy for advice.
