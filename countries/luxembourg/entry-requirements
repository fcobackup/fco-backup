This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Luxembourg set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Luxembourg for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Luxembourg
UK nationals are now permitted to enter Luxembourg for non-essential purposes. To travel to Luxembourg you must have either:
proof of vaccination;
proof of recovery;
proof of a negative PCR test (carried out less than 72 hours before departure) or a negative antigen COVID-19 test (carried out less than 48 hours before departure) for all passengers aged twelve and over.
If arriving by air, complete a passenger locator form while on the plane.
Further details can be found on the Luxembourg government’s website
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Luxembourg will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. However a screenshot or a photo is not sufficient. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
You will be regarded as vaccinated if you have been vaccinated with a vaccine that either:
has been authorised by the European Medicines Agency, Member State of the European Union or a Member State of the Schengen Area and has been administered in full in accordance with the requirements or recommendations of the country in which the vaccination was administered
This includes the AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen vaccines that are available in the UK.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Luxembourg and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Luxembourg government’s entry requirements. Check with the Luxembourg Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Luxembourg with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Luxembourg or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Luxembourg border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Luxembourg. If you are resident in Luxembourg, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Luxembourg guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Luxembourg, or any other Schengen country
less than 10 years old
The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry and exit from Luxembourg.
