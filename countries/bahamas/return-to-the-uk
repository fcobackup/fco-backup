Due to the travel restrictions there are no direct flights to the UK or Europe. Severely limited options may be possible via other destinations such as the US, but you should refer to those countriesâ€™ restrictions before travelling to ensure that you will be allowed to enter the country for onward connection. Travellers should contact their airlines, travel agents and tour operators for advice.
