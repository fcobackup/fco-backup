This page has information on travelling to Slovenia. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Slovenia set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
If you are travelling to Slovenia indirectly, please refer to the Travel Advice for the countries through which you will be transiting.
If you are not resident in Slovenia, you should be aware that for stays longer than 90 days, you will be required to register as a Temporary Resident. Contact the Uprava Enota (the department that handles these applications) at +386 1 306 3034 or ue.ljubljana@gov.si. The department is open from Monday to Thursday from 8am-6pm and on Friday from 8am-2pm.
Travellers arriving in Slovenia must continue to complete the Digital Passenger Locator Form 24 hours before arrival, if entering via an airport or a ferry terminal. The form is not required if entering overland at a border crossing. On completion of the Passenger Locator Form you will receive a QR code which must be shown on entry. The link to the Digital Passenger Locator Form can be found on the Slovene Government Website

If you’re transiting through Slovenia
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Transiting through Slovenia is permitted.
If you are not fully vaccinated or cannot meet the requirements for those who are not fully vaccinated, you will need to show proof that you will leave Slovenia in the shortest possible time, limited to a maximum of 12 hours. Overnight stays are not permitted.
If you declare that you are positive for COVID-19 or show obvious signs of infection of COVID-19 you may still be allowed to travel only if you can unequivocally prove that your only reason for entering is to transit Slovenia in your own vehicle, without stopping and that you plan to leave Slovenia in the shortest possible time, limited to a maximum of 12 hours.
You will not be allowed entry if are unable to leave Slovenia due to measures in place in neighbouring countries.
This exemption from the COVID 19 entry rules is not applicable to those who are resident in Slovenia.
More information on transiting Slovenia can be found here [Policija - Transit through Slovenia on way to another country - clarification].
If you are travelling to neighbouring countries you should check the travel advice for the latest information on entering those countries. See travel advice for Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Italy.
Internal checkpoints on the Schengen borders with Italy, Austria and Hungary have been removed.
Quarantine requirements if you cannot meet the COVID-19 entry rules
From 19 February 2022, Slovenia has removed the requirement for travellers arriving in Slovenia to quarantine. All travellers will be given advice at the border regarding the steps they may need to take.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Slovenia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Slovenian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Slovene Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, you may need.
If you are travelling to Slovenia for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Slovenia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count to-wards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Slovenia as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Slovenia, read our Living in Slovenia guide for passport stamping information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovenia.
