Travel in Sudan
Internal flights and all bus services between States have been suspended until further notice.
The Sudanese authorities have imposed a 24/7 lockdown in Khartoum state, which remains in place. Curfews are in effect throughout the rest of the country, enforced by the police and armed forces. You should check the curfew times for the state in which you are located, and you must observe the lockdown and the curfew times. An Emergency Order has been signed permitting police and armed forces to fine and imprison people who break curfew.
The lockdown in Khartoum State means that:
everyone must remain at home. There are exemptions for emergency and essential workers
public and private gatherings are banned
the bridges across the Nile are closed
people may leave home between 6am and 3pm to shop for essential items in their neighbourhood.
all public departments and institutions remain closed, except core institutions including security agencies, hospitals and pharmacies
all private companies, shops and stores are closed, except bakeries, supermarkets and haulage companies
The Sudanese authorities are strict in enforcing restrictions on movement within Khartoum state. You should only leave home in exceptional circumstances – for example going to supermarkets or pharmacies for essential items, or to access medical care. You should comply with all local restrictions introduced by the Sudanese authorities.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Accommodation
Some hotels remain open but may offer limited services.
Public places and services
The majority of cafes and restaurants are closed as a result of the lockdown. Some markets continue to operate during the break in the curfew for shopping.
Mosques and other places of worship may be open to the public with social distancing and other preventive measures in place.
