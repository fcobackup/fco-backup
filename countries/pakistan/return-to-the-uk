On 21 March, the government of Pakistan announced the suspension of all international flights to Pakistan, until 2000 PST on 4 April. The government of Pakistan described the measure as a ‘temporary suspension imposed due to exceptional circumstances’. We understand that the suspension applies also to international flights out of Pakistan.
Despite this suspension, we understand Qatar Airways is planning operating daily flights from Islamabad International Airport from 25 March until 3 April. We understand that other airlines may be planning one-off or limited services leaving Pakistan in the next few days. If transiting a third country, please check that you will be able to fly on to the UK. Some internal flights within Pakistan have also been cancelled.
If you live in the UK and are currently travelling abroad you are strongly advised to return, where and while there are still commercial routes available. You should contact airlines and travel agents immediately. If you are a permanent resident overseas, you should stay and follow the advice of local authorities.
