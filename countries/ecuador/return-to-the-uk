Travelling to the airport
When travelling to the airport, including travel between provinces, you need a safe passage document. Email BritishEmbassy.Quito@fco.gov.uk to get one. A consular officer will respond as quickly as possible. It is very important that you carry documents that justify your movement, including a confirmed booking, your passport and the safe passage document referred above. Safe passage documents are required for each individual. Once you have filled out the form, you will need to send a copy or photo via email to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at dcp@cancilleria.gob.ec so they can confirm validity if you are stopped.
Drivers and taxis need to arrange their own safe passage document through the Government website.
The Ecuadorean authorities are now requiring all passengers and crew members to wear face masks to enter airports and to board a plane.
Future options
The British Embassy Quito is in contact with airlines, the Ecuadorean authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK are available again as soon as possible, however such options are unlikely to be available until at least May.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British Embassy on its Twitter and Facebook channels.
If you cannot leave Ecuador at this time, you should:
