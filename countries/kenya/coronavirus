On 28 September, the nationwide curfew was extended for a further 60 days. From 29 September onwards, the curfew will be in effect from 11pm to 4am (local time). During curfew hours, everyone must stay at home or indoors, except for essential service workers. The government of Kenya has advised that passengers departing the airport during curfew must retain their boarding pass as proof of their arrival time, which will allow for movement to their accommodation. Similarly, evidence of air passengers arriving during curfew will enable access for drivers coming to collect passengers during curfew hours.
You do not need a COVID-19 negative test to board domestic flights within Kenya.
The Government of Kenya has directed that, in addition to public transport systems, social distancing rules – in the form of capacity restrictions – will also apply when using private vehicles, including taxis. This means five-seater vehicles will only be allowed to carry two passengers in addition to the driver, while seven-seater vehicles will only be allowed four passengers in addition to the driver.
Public places and services
The Government of Kenya has directed that face masks must be worn in public places, except when dining, or when adhering to social distancing in hotels, gardens or on beaches.
Public places, tourism and hospitality establishments, travel and tour companies, hotels and other accommodations, restaurants, eateries, food and beverage outlets and entertainment and recreation facilities are allowed to operate, provided they comply with Government of Kenya public health protocols, including 1.5 metre social distancing and the night-time curfew. Bars have been allowed to reopen from 29 September.
On 28 September, the Government of Kenya directed that eateries and restaurants will close at 10pm (local time), but will be permitted to sell alcohol, effective 29 September.
Large gatherings, meetings, conferences and political events remain suspended. However, the maximum number of persons permitted to attend funerals and weddings has been reviewed upwards to 200, with all in attendance expected to abide by Ministry of Health protocols.
Kenyan citizens have been advised to avoid crowded places and to work remotely where possible.
Healthcare in Kenya
The Government of Kenya has indicated that anyone testing positive for COVID-19, but presenting as asymptomatic or with only mild symptoms, can expect to be directed to self-isolate at home if able to do so. Vulnerable persons will be prioritised for hospital care. Ministry of Health guidance is available.
Pharmacies and other shops selling essential products remain open, though business hours may be affected by the nationwide curfew.
The authorities are conducting random temperature screenings in spaces frequented by the general public. If you show signs or symptoms of coronavirus and are able to self-isolate, you can expect to be directed to do so. If you cannot self-isolate, you can expect to be taken into a State health facility by the Kenyan authorities.
