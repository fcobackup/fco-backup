Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
There are no routine commercial flights in to or out of South Sudan. South Sudan has reopened its land borders but in effect they remain closed due to restrictions in place from neighbouring countries.
South Sudan has suspended the issue of visas at its embassies abroad, and the South Sudan Embassy in London is closed.
Coronavirus (COVID-19) certificate
To enter South Sudan, you must have a certificate showing you are free from coronavirus, issued no more than 48 hours ahead of your journey, and endorsed by a reputable medical provider. You will also need prior permission to enter the country from the National Taskforce.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
South Sudan has suspended the issue of visas at its Embassies abroad, and all routine international commercial flights have been suspended since 24 March.
Visas are valid for 1 month. If you wish to stay in South Sudan for longer than 1 month you’ll need to apply for an extension at the Ministry of Interior in Juba (although visas and visa extensions are currently not being issued due to coronavirus (COVID-19) measures now in place). You should also consider whether you require a work permit while in South Sudan. If in doubt you should contact the Ministry of Labour in Juba. You must register with the local police station if you’re in South Sudan for longer than 4 days.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into South Sudan.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Although the World Health Organisation doesn’t specify a certificate requirement, you’re required to provide a certificate of vaccination against yellow fever when you apply for your visa.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for exit from South Sudan.
