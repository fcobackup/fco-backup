Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there. If you are staying in hotel accommodation and you test positive you will be moved to a government medical facility, with guidance and assistance from the Ministry of Health, and placed in quarantine at a hospital in the parallel healthcare system or state approved medical facility. You can expect to be placed under the Ministry of Health’s care within 24hrs of receiving a positive test result. Minors (under 18) testing positive will be required to isolate immediately at the discretion of the County Medical Officers of Health (CMOH) and an additional quarantine order will be applied.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
