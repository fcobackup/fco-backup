There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Bangladesh, due to flight restrictions announced by the Government of Bangladesh.
Biman Airlines has extended the suspension of its domestic and international flights, including flights to and from the UK until 16 May. China Southern and US Bangla airlines are still operating flights to China, but these are for Chinese nationals only.

This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM).
