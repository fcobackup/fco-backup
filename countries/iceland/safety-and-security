 Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.    
Terrorism in Iceland
Terrorist attacks in Iceland cannot be ruled out.
Crime
Crime levels are low but petty theft and antisocial behaviour can occur, particularly around bars in downtown Reykjavík. Take sensible precautions and keep your belongings safe.      
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
You do not have to carry your passport with you, but it is sensible to have some form of ID, such as a photocard driving licence. You could also carry a copy of your passport’s photo page as ID. Keep your passport somewhere safe.
Smoking and e-cigarette bans
It is illegal to smoke or use e-cigarettes in restaurants, bars, public transport and public buildings, and you could get a fine.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
It is illegal to possess even small amounts of drugs, including marijuana and khat. Anyone caught could get a heavy fine and a prison sentence.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual activity is legal in Iceland and same-sex relationships are recognised in law.

Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Hiking, mountaineering and other adventure sports have specific risks.
You should:
read the Safe Travel Iceland guides
leave travel plans and contact details with your hotel, or on Safe Travel Iceland
take a phone with you
Hiking and mountaineering
When hiking, choose a trail suited for your level of experience. Conditions in Iceland could be different to what you’re used to.
Going too close to the ocean, cliff edges and hot springs are common causes of accidents in Iceland.
Take enough food, equipment, clothing and emergency rations for the worst-case scenario. Use a map, compass, GPS and phone.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Iceland, see information on driving abroad and check the rules of the road in the RAC’s Iceland guide. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.
You must:
obey speed limits – fines for speeding are high
keep dipped headlights on all the time – you could get a fine if you do not
follow drink-drive laws – alcohol limits are much stricter than in the UK
use winter tyres from 1 November to 15 April – exact dates can vary
You could get a fine of 20,000 krona per tyre for using studded tyres after the winter dates end in April.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Iceland for up to 30 days. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the 1968 version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well.  
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP. 
If you bring your own car, check if you need a UK sticker to drive it outside the UK. 
Driving conditions
Distances between towns can be large, roads are narrow and winding, and speed limits are low. On gravel and loose surfaces reduce your speed.
Check road and weather advice from the Icelandic Road Administration. They also have information on off-road driving, which is strictly controlled.
Many highland tracks are only open for a short part of the summer. In the highlands you should use a 4-wheel drive vehicle. Drive slowly (5 to 10 kilometres per hour) when you cross rivers. River levels can change quickly, even within the same day.
The weather can change quickly. Infrequent strong winds can cause sand and ash storms. British tourists have had to pay large amounts of money to repair damage to hire cars caused by sand and ash.
Breakdown recovery costs, especially in remote areas, can be high.

Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes
Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are common in Iceland.
Recently there has been a series of volcanic eruptions on the Reykjanes peninsula in south-west Iceland, the latest on 29 May. These have affected the town of Grindavik and the area to the north of it. Icelandic authorities advise that you stay away from this area. All roads to Grindavik and the surrounding area are closed.
The likelihood of further eruptions in this location remains high. Check local media for updates and follow the Iceland authorities’ advice on travel to the area.
