The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Hungary has restricted entry to foreign nationals.
Hungarian citizens and EEA citizens (including UK nationals) holding a Permanent Residence Card or a Registration Certificate and Address Card are allowed to enter the country following a medical examination at the border to check for signs of Covid-19 infection. Those individuals suspected of infection will be put into officially designated quarantine for 14 days. If there is no suspicion of infection, individuals will still be required to quarantine at home for 14 days.
From 4 May, citizens of the Czech Republic, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Germany, Austria and Slovakia may also enter Hungary from these countries for business purposes. This measure also allows Hungarian citizens to travel to and from these countries for business trips, provided that they are an employee of a domestic firm or company registered in one of these six countries and that the firm or company has business ties with another company registered in one of these six countries. Individuals who fall under this category of business travellers may enter Hungary without any restriction or requirement for self-isolation.
UK nationals who do not fall into the categories noted above, but who wish to enter Hungary for business, study or other reasons, or transit through Hungary, must submit an application for exemption on the official website of the Hungarian Police by completing an electronic form here. The form is currently only available in Hungarian and must be completed in Hungarian. The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade recommend applications are submitted at least a few days before the planned travel day, clearly stating the justification for the exemption application. Anyone entering Hungary following this application route will need to follow the same quarantine rules as returning residents, as noted above.
The situation may change rapidly, including in neighbouring countries, where some airports have closed or ceased direct flights to the UK.

Customs regulations
Community regulations ensure the free movement of goods between EU member states. This means that no customs procedures are required for exporting goods from Hungary to another EU member state and/or for importing goods from a member state to Hungary. The export and import of goods purchased for non-commercial purposes (for personal use or as gifts) while travelling is not restricted, however, the transport of certain goods (such as: pets, hunting weapons, alcohol and tobacco products, medicines containing drugs, etc.) within the European Union is restricted or subject to special permissions.
Check the customs regulations before entering or leaving Hungary on the National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary website.
