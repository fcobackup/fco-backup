At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus in Japan, including instances of in-country transmission. It may cause more severe symptoms in older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions. There are enhanced quarantine procedures at entry points to Japan such as airports and ports. The authorities may carry out extended health checks on arrival including compulsory hospitalisation. You should comply with any additional screening measures by the authorities if asked to go through extra checks.
As a preventative measure against the spread of coronavirus, the government of Japan has announced that, unless there are exceptional circumstances the following people are not permitted to enter Japan:
foreign nationals who have been to Hubei or Zhejiang provinces in the People’s Republic of China within 14 days prior to arrival.
foreign nationals who have a Chinese passport issued by Hubei or Zhejiang provinces in the People’s Republic of China.
foreign nationals who have travelled to the South Korean city of Daegu or the neighbouring county of Cheongo; and the cities of Gyeongsan, Andong, Yeoncheo, and counties of Chilgok, Uiseong, Seongju or Gunwi in North Gyeongsang Province within 14 days prior to arrival.
foreign nationals who have travelled to the Iranian provinces of Qom, Tehran or Gilan within 14 days prior to arrival.
The Government of Japan has announced that, effective 9 March:
All travellers entering Japan from China or the Republic of Korea will be asked to go into quarantine at designated locations for 14 days, and to refrain from using public transport.
Passenger flights from China and the Republic of Korea will be asked to land at Narita and Kansai international airports, and passenger ferry services will be asked to stop operating. *Visas issued by the Japanese authorities in China and Korea for future travel to Japan will be cancelled, and visa exemptions from travellers from the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong and Macao will be stopped.
Some flights from Japan to mainland China have been suspended or cancelled. Check with your travel provider for updates.
The Government of Japan has requested that all primary and secondary schools close from 2 March until regular spring holidays at the end of March. They have also requested that organisers consider postponing or cancelling large-scale cultural and sporting events during an initial two-week period from 26 February. The northern island of Hokkaido also issued a ‘declaration of state of emergency on 28 February lasting until 19 March, asking residents to refrain from going out, particularly at weekends. British nationals in Japan should continue to follow the advice of local authorities.
The Japan National Tourism Organisation has a 24 hour hotline (+81 50 3816-2787) which provides support and advice for visitors in Japan including on coronavirus. NHK news (English) has the latest information about coronavirus in Japan. British nationals living in Japan who have symptoms and are concerned that they may have been infected may wish to contact a local hotline. Details are available on this website.
If you’re returning to the UK from Japan, consult the latest advice from the Department of Health and Social Care on actions you should take if you develop symptoms on your return.
Further advice on coronavirus is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You may also want to check the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare webpages on advice if you bring medicine into Japan, a general Q&A as well as a list of banned items.
Medical treatment
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 119 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Medical facilities are good, but the cost of treatment is high. Hospitals and clinics are well equipped and staff highly trained. There are very few British doctors practising in Japan, but some Japanese doctors may speak English. You will be expected to pay the whole cost of any treatment you receive and there have been cases where treatment has been delayed whilst medical facilities check the legitimacy of the insurance. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance that covers pre-existing conditions and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Residents in Japan will be required to enrol in either Employee or National Health Insurance.
