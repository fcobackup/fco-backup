Direct flights from Japan to UK are still being operated by British Airways, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways. Indirect flights to the UK transiting via a third country are also possible, but we advise you to contact your airline or travel agent to check availability and re-book your flight if necessary. A number of airlines are suspending flights, and airlines will continue to review their services in the coming days.
See additional advice on making travel plans to return to the UK, or what to do if you cannot depart immediately.
