There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, but cases have been confirmed in other countries, including the Czech Republic.
On 12 March, the Czech government declared a 30-day State of Emergency in response. From midnight 13 March, (between Friday 13 March and Saturday 14 March), citizens from fifteen countries, including the UK, will not be permitted to enter the Czech Republic. Exceptions to this rule are UK citizens with permanent or temporary residency. As further information becomes available, we will add more details. Further measures included the closure of pubs and restaurants between 20:00 and 06:00, and the outlawing of events with more than 30 people. This is in addition to measures announced on the 10 March, which included the closure of schools and universities (except kindergartens, which remain open). British travellers currently in the Czech Republic are allowed to leave. If you have questions regarding your onward travel arrangements, please contact your travel provider. See Health.
