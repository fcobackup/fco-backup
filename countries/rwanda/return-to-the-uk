The Rwandan authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), including suspending all flights to and from Kigali International Airport from 23:59 local time on 20 March, for an initial period of 30 days. Emergency Flights are the only exceptions. All land borders are also closed.
You should urgently contact your airline or tour operator if you are due to travel to or from Rwanda. The closure of borders and restrictions on movement outside of residences, including travel between cities and districts, was introduced at 23.59 on 21 March for an initial two week period.
The British High Commission is in contact with airlines and local authorities where there is the possibility of an Emergency Flight out of Rwanda.
If you wish to leave Rwanda, please get in touch with the British High Commission via our Kigali Enquiries mailbox.
The British High Commission is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on departure options from Rwanda.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
