At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
Since 13 March, there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ethiopia. You should call the Ethiopian COVID-19 helpline on 8335 for advice or if you are experiencing symptoms while in Ethiopia. Current information is available from the Ethiopian Public Health Institute.
Those people displaying symptoms linked to COVID-19 may be transferred to a nearby isolation facility for up to 24 hours while further tests are carried out.
The Ethiopian Public Health Institute advises that anyone who tests positive for the virus but displays only mild symptoms will be required to remain at the isolation facility for a further 14 days, in line with WHO guidance. Anyone with a pre-existing condition that requires regular medicines should bring sufficient amounts to cover a potential unplanned additional 2 week stay. More serious cases will be transferred to hospital.
Private healthcare facilities used by the international community with the capability to respond to COVID-19 cases exist, but capacity is limited. These facilities are also those most frequently recommended by British travel insurance companies for other illnesses or injuries. You should therefore be aware that the ability to access treatment for other ailments is likely to be limited. You should check with your insurance company which facilities they recommend and phone the healthcare facility before you visit.
Addis Ababa Bole International Airport (and other international ports of arrival) have put in place additional measures for health screening of passengers, for arrivals, departures and transit passengers. Screening may include temperature measurements and checks on recent travel to affected areas.
People arriving from the UK (and other countries with significant numbers of infections) may be asked to limit their movements or self-isolate. The policy on this continues to be reviewed regularly by the Ethiopian Government in response to changes in the global outbreak.
A number of major airlines have reduced their flight schedules in response to COVID-19. You should check with your airline or travel agent for the latest information before you travel.
Further advice is available from Public Health England, and the TravelHealthPro website.
Medical treatment
There are a number of hospitals in Addis Ababa but only private hospitals offer a reasonable standard of basic care for minor health problems. Dentistry options are especially lacking. Ambulance services are also limited. Outside the capital medical facilities remain extremely poor. You should carry a comprehensive medical pack when travelling out of Addis Ababa. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, evacuation by air ambulance and repatriation. You should contact your insurance / medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Health risks
UK health authorities have classified Ethiopia as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For more information and advice, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre.
Malaria is common in areas of the country below 2,000 metres above sea level. Addis Ababa sits at 2,400 metres but a number of sites popular with tourists are below 2,000.
Bilharzia is present in the vast majority of lakes in Ethiopia - you should check before swimming.
An outbreak of Chikungunya fever has been reported in Dire Dewa by the Ethiopian Ministry of Health as of September 2019. Travellers to this area should take steps to avoid mosquito bites. For the latest updates and advice, visit the NaTHNaC website.
