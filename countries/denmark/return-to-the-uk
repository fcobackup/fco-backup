There remain limited commercial options to return to the UK from Denmark.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Denmark, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise that British nationals that wish to leave Denmark contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
Flights from Denmark
Copenhagen and Billund airports remain open. However, there are currently no direct flights from Denmark to the UK after 8 April until further notice. You should refer to carriers’ websites for the latest information on flight availability, including indirect routes, but note that schedules may change. You should check the travel advice pages for any country that you transit through on the way back to the UK.
Flights from Greenland and the Faroe Islands
There are no commercial flights to and from Greenland until at least 31 May. The commercial air service to the Faroe Islands has been severely reduced, with only one daily service to and from Copenhagen on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.
