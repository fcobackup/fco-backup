On 12 March, the Slovak government declared a State of Emergency and announced a range of restrictions on travel and events.
Local public transport is running on a reduced timetable.
It is mandatory to wear a mask or otherwise cover your nose and mouth when travelling on public transport and anywhere outside the home. The exceptions to wearing a face mask outside are only for: children under 2 years; people from the same household walking in the countryside as long as they remain 20 metres from others; people diagnosed with serious autism; people in a car if they are from the same household.
Most public gatherings remain banned, including sporting events, cinemas and theatres. All kindergartens, schools, universities, swimming pools and spas are closed until further notice.
As part of a phased lifting of restrictions, from 6 May the following services are open, but with social distancing and hygiene measures in place:
shops (except the largest shopping malls), supermarkets, pharmacies, outdoor markets
some outdoor sports venues for non-contact sports, without changing rooms/toilets and without spectators
car dealerships (new and second-hand)
short and long-term accommodation without catering
hairdressers, pedicure and manicure services
outdoor tourist attractions, outdoor areas of bars and restaurants; museums, galleries, libraries and exhibition halls, and church services
taxi services
