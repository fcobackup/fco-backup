Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 117, 1300, 011760873 or 1333 and ask for an ambulance. Operators may only speak French.
These numbers are not always reliable. Emergency help can be limited.
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
