Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Eritrea, attacks can’t be ruled out.
Be vigilant at all times, especially in crowded areas and public places like transport hubs, hotels, restaurants and bars and during major gatherings like sporting or religious events. Previous terrorist attacks in the region have targeted places where football matches are being viewed.
