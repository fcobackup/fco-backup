Road travel
See the RAC guide on driving in Montenegro.
Licences and documents
To drive in Montenegro you must have a valid foreign driving licence and International Driving Permit (IDP). You can get the IDP over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. If you’re staying longer than 6 months in Montenegro you will need to get a local driving licence.
You must also have the original Certificate of Motor Insurance and the original V5C vehicle log book with you . If you fail to carry the right documents, you will be refused entry and the car may be impounded until you can prove ownership. The FCDO cannot assist you in confirming the validity of photocopied and/or emailed registration logbooks (V5C) nor obtain originals for you.
Drivers of cars registered on foreign plates without a valid international motor insurance will have to buy temporary insurance for Montenegro, available for purchase at all officialborder crossings (“granichno osiguranje” in Montenegrin).
Road standards
The standard of roads is fair to poor with conditions worsening in rural areas, especially in the winter and after bad weather. In particular, the two-lane Moraca Canyon in Montenegro can be dangerous when conditions are poor and there is overcrowding. Roads leading to Montenegro’s coastal areas are in better condition, but can be overcrowded during the summer season.
Driving regulations
By law you must wear a seatbelt. Riders of scooters, mopeds or motorcycles must wear a crash helmet.
You must drive with dipped headlights on during the day and must not use a mobile phone while driving. You must equip your car for winter conditions when the weather requires it, including winter tyres on many roads from 15 November to 31 March.
Montenegrin traffic law defines intoxication as a blood alcohol level higher than 0.3 g/kg, or 0.1 g/kg for drivers younger than 24 or with less than 12 months of driving experience.
Exceeding the speed limit by just 10kph will get you a fine in Montenegro, while excessive speeding (30kph over the limit in towns and 50kph on motorways) and overtaking under dangerous conditions will lead to automatic confiscation of your driving licence. Fines for traffic offences range from €20 to €6,000. Prison sentences can also be imposed.
If you are issued with a fine, the issuing police officer will usually request payment is made to a bank account within a reasonable time. In certain circumstances your passport may be seized. If you deny the charge you have the right to appear in court. All fine receipts have serial numbers and can be monitored in a central register for 3 years.
If you are involved in a small traffic accident, you can request a police investigation at a cost of 50 euros. This fee is reimbursable from the person found guilty for causing the accident after completion of the court proceedings. Drivers can opt to complete a European accident report and submit it to their insurance company without a police investigation.
The only toll roads in Montenegro are the Sozina tunnel between Lake Skadar and the sea and the Princess Ksenija motorway between Podgorica and Kolasin.
Sea travel
If you are sailing to Montenegro, enter only at a designated port/harbour. If this is not possible, contact the local harbour master or the police before entering.
If you have experienced an accident at sea, call 129, the emergency number of the rescue unit within the Maritime Safety Department.
Extreme and adventure sports
A wide range of outdoor activities are on offer for tourists. Take precautions to prevent injuries and use protective equipment. Before signing up with paragliding instructors, for example, ask to see their training licence for tandem flights. Make sure you have a correct licence when renting vehicles, particularly jet skis.
If you’re hiking in the mountains, seek expert advice from local guides, Do not underestimate the hike: factors like weather, landscape, distance and elevation can increase the risks. Take a fully charged mobile phone and enough supplies with you. There have been reports of hikers getting lost in the mountains when they have left marked paths.
If you get into trouble, call the emergency number 112.
Political situation
Protests and demonstrations sometimes take place in Montenegro, often in front of government or religious buildings and Parliament. Evening protest gatherings are currently being organised in the capital on a rolling basis most weeks. These are largely peaceful but can lead to traffic disruption and have occasionally involved clashes with the police and have the potential to involve violent incidents.
You should exercise caution, keep up to date with local developments, check local media, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and find alternative routes where possible. In the event of any incidents, you should follow the advice of local authorities.
