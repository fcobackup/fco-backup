This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Japan set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Japan
From 30 November 2021, foreign nationals (including British nationals) who do not have existing resident status are not permitted to enter Japan for any purpose, other than in exceptional circumstances.
You can find a description of exceptional circumstances on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.
This guidance also applies to foreign nationals in possession of visas issued recently who have not yet entered Japan.
Further details are available on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, or via Japan’s Visa Information Hotline on +44 (0)800 041 8412. Alternatively, contact your nearest Japanese Embassy for more information, including if you believe you qualify for exceptional circumstances.
Re-entry to Japan
From 2 December 2021, foreign nationals (including British nationals) with Status of Residence will be denied re-entry to Japan if they are travelling from South Africa, Eswatini, Namibia, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Lesotho, Angola, Botswana or Zimbabwe.
Foreign nationals with Status of Residence travelling from all other countries who leave or have left Japan with a valid re-entry permit are in principle allowed to re-enter the country. However, please note that Japan has introduced caps on the number of people permitted to arrive by plane, so bookings on some routes have been restricted or suspended. Those who do not have a valid re-entry permit will be denied re-entry; please consult the Japanese authorities for advice. Those entering the country will need to follow appropriate arrival and quarantine / self-isolation rules as set out below, and provide written evidence of a negative COVID-19 test conducted within the 72 hours before their flight departure time. You should check the Japanese government’s advice on this re-entry process on the (https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page25e_000334.html).
Visas
Japan has suspended its visa waiver system for anyone travelling on a British Citizen or British National (Overseas) passport with no indication of when this suspension will be lifted. Japan has also suspended single and multiple entry visas issued by Japanese Embassies and Consulates General in the UK (and many other countries) prior to 20 March 2020; the full list can be found on the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. Anyone arriving in Japan without a valid visa will not be able to enter.
Testing/screening on arrival
All passengers arriving in Japan are required to complete a health questionnaire before disembarkation, including contact details. They are then required to undergo a COVID-19 test at the airport. You will be asked to wait for the test results at the airport before moving to your quarantine destination.
Quarantine and self-isolation requirements
From 1 December 2021 all travellers entering Japan, whether fully vaccinated or not, must undertake 14 days of quarantine and self-isolation. For those coming from the UK, the first 6 days must be spent in quarantine in a government-provided hotel. You will need to take a COVID-19 test on days 3 and 6 (the day of arrival counts as Day 0). If the tests are negative, you will be permitted to move into self-isolation at home or in a self-arranged hotel for the remainder of the 14-day period.
You will be required to sign a written pledge upon arrival which commits you to these rules. The pledge also commits you to avoiding public transport, installing Japan’s COVID-19 tracing app, and maintaining – and in some cases disclosing – your location data. You may be subject to enhanced monitoring due to the presence in the UK of the Omicron COVID-19 variant.
Failure to comply with these requests could lead to you being subject to detention under the Quarantine Act. It could also result in the release of your name and information related to reducing the spread of infection and, for foreign nationals, possible revocation of your Status of Residence and subsequent deportation.
More details on Japan’s current quarantine rules, including rules for those travelling from countries other than the UK, are available on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. New measures may be brought in at short notice.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Both vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers are currently subject to the same quarantine and self-isolation requirements. However, in principle, the Japanese Government does recognise the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Transiting Japan
The measures listed above do not apply to passengers who are transiting through one Japanese airport and do not go through immigration. If you are transiting using different airports you will need a transit permit on arrival.
To get one you will be required to demonstrate that you have not come from a country on the banned list, that you have timely onward travel plans, and that you will not use public transport to move between airports; this includes taxis.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. You should also check the latest entry requirements for your destination.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
In normal circumstances, if you have a ‘British Citizen’ or ‘British National (Overseas)’ passport you can enter Japan as a visitor for up to 90 days without a visa. You may need to provide evidence of a return or onward ticket.
If you have a different type of British nationality, or you wish to enter Japan for other purposes (long-term stay, study, settlement, employment); if you have any doubts about whether you’re eligible to enter Japan (eg, if you have a criminal record or have been arrested even if it did not result in a conviction) or about visa matters generally, contact a Japanese Embassy or Consulate. Visas aren’t issued after arrival in Japan.
It’s illegal to work in Japan without the correct visa, however informal or temporary the work. Don’t overstay your permission to remain in the country, otherwise you risk arrest, detention and a heavy fine.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Japan.
Medication
The use or possession of some common prescription and over-the-counter medicines are banned under Japan’s strictly enforced anti-stimulant drugs law. This includes Vicks inhalers, medicines for allergies and sinus problems, cold and flu medication containing Pseudoephedrine and even some over-the-counter painkillers like those containing codeine. Foreign nationals have been detained and deported for offences - ignorance may not be considered a defence. You should check the status of your medication with the nearest Japanese Embassy or Consulate before you travel.
If you’re travelling with prescription medication that is permitted under Japanese law, you’re normally allowed to bring in up to one month’s supply. You’re advised to bring a copy of your prescription and a letter from your doctor stating the medical condition that the medication has been prescribed to treat. For more guidance on travelling with medication, check information pages from NHS Choices and the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) in our foreign travel checklist.
If you need prescription medicine for long term use, you may need to provide extra paperwork, such as an import licence. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare provides information about bringing medication for personal use.
