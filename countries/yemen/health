Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Yemen.

Before you travel check that: 
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need 
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation 
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant. 
Emergency medical number 
Call 191 and ask for an ambulance.  
Due to the current conflict, emergency services may not be able to respond. It may be better to make your own way to hospital if you can. Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment. 
Vaccine recommendations and health risks 
At least 8 weeks before your trip:  
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Yemen   
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page

malaria and dengue 
Middle East respiratory syndrome

Medication

The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad. 
Healthcare facilities in Yemen  
Medical facilities, particularly away from the main towns and cities, are poor. Make sure that you have adequate travel health insurance and access to funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
