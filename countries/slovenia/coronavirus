COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Slovenia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Slovenia announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Slovenian national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Moderna vaccines. The use of Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) has been suspended. The Government of Slovenia has stated that British nationals resident in Slovenia are eligible for vaccination, including boosters. You should register your interest online via the zVEM service, and also notify your doctor in Slovenia. You will need your EMŠO (Identity card) number and your Slovene health insurance card. The vaccine registration facility is only available in Slovene, so you might need some assistance if you don’t speak Slovene.
Alternatively, you can go to the vaccination centres across the country or view the current schedule (in Slovene).
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
British nationals living in Slovenia should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Slovenia, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations.
