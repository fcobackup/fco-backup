The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Self-isolation on arrival
All arrivals from overseas, including Irish residents, are asked to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival.
You do not need to self-isolate if you are:
arriving in Ireland from Northern Ireland
briefly stopping over at an airport or port on your way to another country
leaving the airport or port to travel overseas or to Northern Ireland, but not staying overnight in Ireland
aircraft crew, including pilots, in Ireland as part of your work duties
holders of a Certificate for International Transport Workers, or drivers of a heavy goods vehicle, who are in Ireland for this work
ship crew, including the maritime master, in the course of performing your duties
If you are leaving the port or airport but will not be residing in Ireland overnight because you are travelling on to Northern Ireland or overseas, you do not need to provide further contact information. You may be asked for evidence in support of this.
Data collection
From 28 May there is a legal requirement for passengers arriving in Ireland from overseas to complete a Public Health Passenger Locator Form, with penalties for non-compliance as detailed in the form.
The form may be used by health authorities to contact you to verify your location in the country. It will also help contact tracers get in touch with you if there is a confirmed case of coronavirus on your flight or ferry.
Regular entry requirements
ID
Ireland, along with the UK, is a member of the Common Travel Area. British nationals travelling from the UK don’t need a passport to visit Ireland. However, Irish immigration officers will check the ID of all passengers arriving by air from the UK and may ask for proof of nationality, particularly if you were born outside the UK. You are therefore advised to take your British passport with you.
For more information about the types of ID you might be asked to present, see the website of the Ireland Citizens Information Board.
Before travelling, check with your carrier about their ID requirements, as most airlines and other transport providers won’t carry passengers to and from Ireland unless they’ve seen satisfactory photographic ID.
Passport validity
If you’re using a passport to enter Ireland, it should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry into, transit through, and exit from Ireland.
