Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Taiwan on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
When COVID levels in Taiwan were very low, every positive case was hospitalised, even in asymptomatic cases. Following the recent spike in cases, the approach is to hospitalise serious cases and admit less serious, including asymptomatic cases, into central quarantine facilities.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Taiwan.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) has announced that from 19 May 2021, the COVID-19 alert has been raised to Level 3 across Taiwan.
A Level 3 alert means the following measures are now in place:
Wearing of masks at all times outdoors
Indoor gatherings limited to five people, outdoor gatherings limited to 10 people
Completing contact tracing procedures when entering restaurants, shops and some public places
Some places of business and public venues are closed, with the exception of essential services, police departments, hospitals, and government buildings. The authorities have said that work places and schools will continue to operate as long as pandemic plans are in place, and flexible working is being encouraged
Masks and social distancing required at all businesses or venues that remain open
In areas where community transmission has taken place, residents are restricted to a set perimeter and must submit to COVID-19 testing
Further information is available on Taiwan’s Centres for Diseases Control website
Those who do not wear a face mask as required in Taiwan face fines of up to NT$15,000.
Travel in Taiwan
Although there is no lockdown in place, the authorities are encouraging people to limit travel between cities and regions to reduce the risk of COVID spread.
Taxis and public transport systems are operating normally in Taiwan. The wearing of face masks is mandatory on all public transport. If you use public transport and are not wearing a face mask, you may be fined up to NT$15,000.
Accommodation
From 27 June 2021, all passengers arriving directly from seven designated countries, including the UK, or those who have been in one of these countries in the preceding 14 days, are required to complete their mandatory 14 day quarantine at a designated quarantine facility. This is due to concern about the Delta variant. All passengers will be required to have two COVID-19 PCR tests, one on arrival in Taiwan and the other at the end of their quarantine period. They must test negative for COVID-19 at the end of the quarantine period to be allowed out of quarantine. The costs of staying in the designated quarantine facilities and two COVID-19 PCR tests will be paid for by the Taiwan authorities.
Passengers arriving into Taiwan from anywhere else will be required to complete their mandatory 14 day quarantine at a quarantine hotel or a designated quarantine facility and will be required to pay for this.
In no circumstances will travellers arriving into Taiwan be able to quarantine in their own residence.
See Entry requirements for more information.
For a list of designated quarantine hotels in Taipei, please visit Taipei City Government’s FAQ page. If you are planning to stay in a hotel outside of Taipei, you may need to contact the local authority in that area prior to booking or making final arrangements. For more information and contact details, please visit the Taiwan Tourism Bureau’s ‘Taiwan Stay’ website.
If you have access to private accommodation in Taiwan, you may choose to self-isolate there rather than in a hotel. You should confirm that you will be permitted to self-isolate in your preferred accommodation before travelling.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Taiwan
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country/territory where they live. We will update this page when the Taiwanese authorities announce new information on their vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Taiwan vaccination programme started in March 2021 and is using the AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines. The Taiwanese authorities have stated that British nationals resident in Taiwan are eligible for vaccination and have announced the first stages of their COVID-19 vaccine roll-out programme. This includes 10 priority groups and lists the criteria and requirements for each. The local authorities have confirmed that all individuals, regardless of nationality, will be eligible to receive a vaccine providing they meet the requirements set out by the Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC). Visit the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control website for further information.
In light of the increase of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases in Taiwan, the local authorities have announced that reservations for self-paid coronavirus vaccinations for overseas travel purposes, have been suspended until further notice. However, any individuals who received their first COVID-19 vaccination in the self-paid programme between 21 April 2021 and 9 May 2021, will be able to receive their second vaccine dose after 10 to 12 weeks.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Taiwan, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
