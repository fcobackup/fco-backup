The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Travel and borders
The Burundi authorities have announced the suspension of flights into and out of Bujumbura International Airport except for cargo flights. There are some emergency flights taking place.
Land borders are also closed.
Any arrivals from affected countries, including the UK, will be placed in compulsory quarantine for 14 days. This also includes anyone who has spent the past 14 days in affected countries prior to entering Burundi. Screening measures are in place at both air and road borders.
Visas
The Burundi authorities currently will no longer issue new visas, and will only renew visas for those already in Burundi. Burundian authorities have confirmed that those whose visas expired since the flight suspension on 22 March are able to get extensions to their visas.
Visitors to Burundi must get a visa before travel, via any Burundian diplomatic mission.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Burundi embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
