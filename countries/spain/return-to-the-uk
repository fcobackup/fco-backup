There are commercial options to return to the UK from Spain.
Flights
Airports across Spain remain open, but airlines continue to operate reduced services. Flights may be subject to cancellation at short notice. Check airline websites, including comparison websites for the latest times and information.
Road travel
Land borders remain open to leave Spain.
From June 21, inter-regional travel is permitted. If travelling with people who are not from the same household, all passengers must wear a face mask covering the nose and mouth. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply.
Travel via France
You can still drive through France to return to the UK. The French government have implemented their own measures, including required documents for travel into, and transit through, France. Check the latest FCO travel advice for France ahead of your journey.
Travel via Gibraltar
British travellers can enter Gibraltar from Spain and enter Spain from Gibraltar. Check the latest FCO travel advice for Gibraltar ahead of your journey.
Ferry travel
There are currently no scheduled passenger ferries operating between Spain and the UK. We are working closely with Brittany Ferries who may be able to assist repatriating a small number of people on their freight services. If your ferry has been cancelled and you wish to return to the UK, please contact the British Embassy online stating your name and booking reference number.
Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
