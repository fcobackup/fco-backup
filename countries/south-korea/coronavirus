Screening and quarantine
All arrivals – regardless of nationality and length of stay – are required to undergo quarantine for 14 days. Korean nationals resident in Korea and foreign nationals with an Alien Registration Card and a residence, are able to self-quarantine at home. Otherwise you will be quarantined at government-arranged facilities and charged a fee – likely to be around 100,000KRW (approximately £66) per day.
All foreign national travellers from Europe are being tested for COVID-19 on arrival in South Korea. Testing may take up to 24 hours and you may be held in a separate facility during this time. If you test positive for the virus you will be transferred to the appropriate healthcare facility. More information on Korean arrival procedures can be found here.
Very limited exemptions from the self-quarantine system may be applied for in order to conduct important – primarily COVID-19 related – business, humanitarian or academic purposes. Approval must be received before travelling from the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in the United Kingdom. Individuals with an exemption will still be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to subject themselves to an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile App.
All visitors should ensure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted.
Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea.
Transit passengers will receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey.
Entry and borders
The Government of South Korea has announced that foreign nationals who have been in Hubei province in China within the previous 14 days will not be allowed to enter South Korea.
Visas

You should continue to consult the Korea Immigration Service website for more information, or contact 1345 (option 3 then *) from inside South Korea.
Healthcare
Make sure you have up to date, comprehensive health insurance.
