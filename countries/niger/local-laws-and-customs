Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Niger.

Niger is a Muslim country. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions and dress in case they offend, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas. In 2022, the holy month of Ramadan is expected to start on the 2 April and finish on the on 1 May. See Travelling during Ramadan.
Do not photograph military or government installations.
You should carry some form of identification at all times. This would normally mean your passport or residence permit. If you drive outside the main towns, the likelihood of having to produce some form of identification is high.
If you commit a criminal offence you will be subjected to local law. Local prison conditions are harsh.
There is no law criminalising homosexuality in Niger. However, there are laws under the Penal Code of 1993 covering ‘public outrage against modesty’ and ‘immodest/unnatural acts’. An ‘unnatural act’ with a person of the same sex who is under the age of 21 can be punishable by a fine of 10,000 to 100,000 francs and up to 3 years imprisonment. Although we are not aware of any prosecutions under this legislation, attitudes within society towards LGBT people can be discriminatory. You should exercise discretion. There are no laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and no legal recognition of same-sex couples. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
