Protests
Most curfews introduced in several cities following violence and protests during week of 8 September 2025 have been lifted. This allows freedom of movement. Restrictions could however be reintroduced. Avoid any large crowds or protests, check local media for updates (including any new curfews) and follow the directions of the authorities. See ‘civil disorder’ on the ‘Safety and security’ page.
Following a period of disruption to airports, flights have resumed. Contact your airline, hotel and tour operator for up-to-date information before travelling.
