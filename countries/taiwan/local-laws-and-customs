You should avoid any involvement with illegal drugs, which includes cannabis, whilst in Taiwan. Drug laws are stricter than in the UK, and involvement with illegal drugs, which includes cannabis, can attract strong sentences. Legal definitions of what constitute supply or trafficking may vary substantially from in the UK, including the quantities of drugs involved. If you’re found guilty of smuggling, trafficking, possession or use of illegal narcotics you can expect to receive a severe jail sentence or, in some cases, the death penalty.
