Quarantine measures
Coronavirus measures have been extended until 28 February 2021. The full list of measures is available on the Ukraine Government portal and includes:
Restaurants, cafes and bars should close between 10pm and 7am (except for takeaway)
A maximum of 20 people are allowed at public events
Gyms and fitness centres are limited to 1 person per 20 square metres
Religious services are limited to 1 person per 5 metres
Museums, galleries, exhibitions and other cultural institutions are limited to 1 person per 10 square metres.
Cinemas and theatres should be limited to 50% of normal capacity
Public transport capacity is limited to the number of seats available (except metro trains)
Visits to care homes for older people and people with disabilities are prohibited (unless you are a family member)
You must carry ID with you at all times. When in public buildings (including restaurants, hotels and shops) you must maintain a minimum distance of 1.5 m. When in public buildings, and while travelling on public transport and in taxis, you must wear a protective mask covering your nose and mouth.
Failure to comply with restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence. Before taking public transport, you should consider whether you will be able to maintain social distancing.
Accommodation
Hotel accommodation remains open under the present quarantine rules, but hostels should be closed. When staying in a hotel, you must adhere to the overall rules regarding masks and minimum distancing. If possible, check in online in advance to avoid check-in queues at the hotel.
Further information can be found at Visit Ukraine.
Public places and services
The majority of services should be open, including shops, restaurants, cafes, religious establishments, beauty salons and hairdressers, museums, libraries, gyms, fitness centres, swimming pools, hardware stores, cobblers, dentists, auditors, lawyers and notaries (providing appropriate hygiene and distancing measures are in place). The number of visitors to shopping centres, restaurants and sports facilities should be limited. Parks and public outdoor spaces are open.
Visas
The State Migration Service has published advice that there will be no penalties for foreigners who were staying in Ukraine legally when restrictions on leaving the country were introduced and who have not been able to leave, to apply to extend the period of their stay and/or to exchange their resident permits. This measure is limited to the period for which travel restrictions are in force.
Where the restrictions on travel and availability of government services mean that foreigners stay in Ukraine beyond the period permitted by their visa-free limit or visa validity, or that they are unable to extend residence permits, there will be no penalties imposed. However, anyone who has overstayed their 90 day visa-free regime during quarantine will not be able to return to Ukraine for 90 days after leaving the country. See Entry requirements
Healthcare in Ukraine

If you have COVID-19 symptoms, such as a dry cough, respiratory difficulties, and a high temperature, you should:
if you have insurance or a private medical provider in Ukraine, seek assistance from them in the first instance
if you do not have insurance or your symptoms are more severe, call an ambulance on 103. Please note that the ambulance service may not have English-speaking operators available. In this case, please enlist the help of a Ukrainian or Russian-speaking friend, family member, hotel worker etc to help you call the ambulance
In both cases, you are likely to be advised to self-isolate, or be taken to a hospital where you will be tested for coronavirus. In case of a positive diagnosis, please inform the British Embassy Kyiv by calling +380 44 490 3660 or by completing this web contact form, or ask a friend or relative to contact us on your behalf.
If taken to hospital, you are likely to be tested for coronavirus. The choice of hospital will depend on your location and the availability of hospitals and/or beds.
If you come into contact with someone who is confirmed to have COVID-19, or has COVID-19 symptoms, you must self-isolate for 14 days. Contact your insurer or private medical provider, or call an ambulance on 103, should you develop symptoms yourself. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence.
