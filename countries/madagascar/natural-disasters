The cyclone season in Madagascar normally runs from November to April. Coastal areas are particularly affected, and remote areas throughout the country can become inaccessible and suffer damage and contamination to water supplies. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), Meteo Madagascar (French) or FB Cyclone Indien Ocean (French, Malagasy).
Tropical Cyclone Emnati crossed Madagascar on Tuesday 22 and Wednesday 23 February, between Manakara on the east coast and the Androy region on the south coast. Tropical Cyclone Batsirai also crossed Madagascar on 5-6 February, between Mananjary on the east coast and Tuléar (Toliara) on the south-west coast. High winds and heavy rainfall have caused damage to buildings, roads and bridges in eastern, central and southern regions, particularly on the east coast in Mananjary, Manakara and Nosy Varika, and inland along the RN7 around Ambositra, Ranomafana, Fianarantsoa, and Ambalavao. Communications and supplies of electricity and water have been disrupted, and there may still be a danger of flooding in affected areas. You should check your route before travelling to or through these areas.
