In late May 2019, teachers and health professionals called for a nationwide strike which was followed by violent protests in major cities in Honduras and at Toncontin Airport. Peaceful protests have since continued in different parts of the country and may continue for some time. These protests could turn violent, leading to the closure of businesses and blockades by protesters on roads in the main cities, including Roatan. These events could cause disruption to transport and cause delays. You should monitor local and social media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator or airline.
