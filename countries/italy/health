COVID-19 healthcare in Italy
COVID-19 testing is widely available at private clinics. Rapid testing is also available in many pharmacies.
Developing symptoms of COVID-19 while in Italy
If you think you have symptoms, take a test at a local pharmacy. You can call your regional hotline for advice. Most of the regional hotlines listed have English-speaking staff. You can also call your local health authority, called ‘ASL’ in Italy (‘Azienda Sanitaria Locale’).
Close contact
If you come into close contact with someone who tests positive, you will need to self-monitor and wear a FFP2 mask for 5 days from the last contact. If you develop symptoms, you should take a test when the symptoms occur and if symptoms remain, test again on the fifth day after being in contact with the positive person. Local health authorities have now indicated you can test in a private facility.
For more details, see the Ministry of Health website.
Testing positive for COVID-19 while in Italy
If you are tested and the result is positive, you must self-isolate for 5 days. A negative test is no longer required at the end of the 5 day self-isolation period, except in certain cases (e.g. health workers, immunocompromised individuals). If you have been symptom-free for at least 2 days, you do not need to produce a negative PCR or antigen test to be released from the self-isolation period early. The local health authority determines the type of test they will use and the pattern of testing.
Once you have completed the period of self-isolation, you must continue to wear a FFP2 mask for at least 10 days after the onset of symptoms or the first positive test result until you have a negative antigen or molecular test result.
You should always follow the advice of the local health authorities as regional variations may apply.
Health insurance cards
Apply for a free UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before leaving the UK. If you already have an EHIC, it will still be valid as long as it remains in date.
The GHIC or EHIC entitles you to state- provided medical treatment necessary during your trip. Any treatment provided is on the same terms as Italian nationals. If you don’t have your EHIC with you or you’ve lost it, contact the NHS Overseas Healthcare Team.
It’s important to take out appropriate travel insurance for your needs. A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both before you travel. An EHIC or GHIC does not cover all health-related costs, for example, medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment. Read more about what your travel insurance should cover.
You can find details of English-speaking doctors in Italy on our list of healthcare providers.
European Health Insurance Cards (EHIC) or UK Global Health Insurance Cards (GHIC) cover state healthcare only, not private treatment. You will be responsible for the cost of any treatment provided by a private doctor or private clinic.
Pharmacies and doctors
Unlike in the UK, you will need to go to a pharmacy to get most over-the-counter medicines. Pharmacies are widely available and are usually identified by a green cross. UK prescriptions are not accepted, though you may be able to buy an equivalent medication from the pharmacy. Alternatively, you can visit an Italian GP to obtain a local prescription. Prescription medicines are not free in Italy, but with an EHIC or GHIC, and an Italian prescription, you will pay a reduced rate.
