Travel is subject to entry restrictions
You must complete and submit an online immigration/customs form 24 hours prior to travel
Barbados designates the UK as a high-risk country. Travellers from the UK must arrive with a negative PCR test taken by a certified or accredited laboratory within 3 days of arrival.
On arrival, you will be required to quarantine at government approved facilities (a designated holding hotel or approved villa at your own expense, or a government facility free of charge), and undertake a further test 5 days after the first accepted negative test. You will need to stay in your hotel room and may be required to wear an electronic tracking bracelet until you receive the results of your second test. If this second test is negative you will no longer be subject to quarantine. The government aims to return results within 24 to 48 hours. However, at present, return times are estimated at around 5 days. Check the Barbados Travel Protocols carefully for full details of these requirements
The Government has extended extra measures until 31 January, including a 9pm to 5am curfew and a ban on gatherings. See Coronavirus for more information.
Protocols can change at short notice. You should regularly monitor and follow the Barbados Government Information Service website and Barbados Travel Protocols. The Barbadian authorities will seek to prosecute people who breach COVID-19 protocols, including those who break quarantine protocols, which may result in a fine and/or prison sentence.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
