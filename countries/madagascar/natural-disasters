The cyclone season in Madagascar normally runs from November to April. Coastal areas are particularly affected. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), Meteo Madagascar (French) or FB Cyclone Indien Ocean (French, Malagasy).
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if youâ€™re caught up in a storm.
