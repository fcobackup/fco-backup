There is an ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, but other cases have been confirmed in other countries, including Burkina Faso. The Burkina Faso authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. See Health
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Burkina Faso, including Ouagadougou. Attacks could be indiscriminate, affecting Burkina Faso security forces, religious sites, restaurants and places visited by foreigners. Further attacks are possible. You should exercise particular caution around religious holidays. See Terrorism
There’s also a risk that terrorist groups may cross the border from Mali and the northern border with Niger into Burkina Faso to carry out kidnap attacks. On 11 May 2019, four hostages, including westerners, were rescued during a French military operation in northern Burkina Faso. Two of the rescued hostages were French tourists who had been kidnapped from Pendjari National Park in Benin on 1 May 2019. See Kidnap
In June 2019, Burkina Faso passed a law criminalising the dissemination of information about terrorist attacks and security forces that could undermine public order or the conduct of security operations.
A state of emergency remains in place in the Est and Sahel regions, the western provinces of Kossi and Sourou, the central-eastern province of Koulpélogo, the western province of Kénédougou and northern province of Lorum. The measure gives security forces extra powers to search homes and restrict freedom of movement.
