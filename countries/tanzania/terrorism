Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Tanzania, including in major cities. Although Tanzania has not suffered a major terrorist incidence since the bombing of the US Embassy in 1998, there have been a number of smaller scale incidents. In October 2020 the village of Kitara in the Mtawa region was attacked. Close to the border with Mozambique, the attack was claimed by Islamic extremists operating in Northern Mozambique. Most attacks target the local security forces, though attacks against Western interests are also possible.
Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning. There is a risk of kidnapping for ransom and political purposes. Places frequented by Westerners, including places of worship, transport hubs, embassies, hotels and restaurants, and major gatherings like sporting and religious events may be targets. Previous attacks in the region have targeted places where football matches are being viewed. You should exercise heightened vigilance at all times, especially in crowded areas and public places, and follow the advice of local authorities. You should regularly reassess your security arrangements and consider carefully any travel around the country.
Extremists linked to the Islamic terrorist group Al-Shabaab based in Somalia pose a threat across the East Africa region, and are thought to be active in Tanzania. Attacks by IS-Mozambique, who are based in the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique, are possible near Tanzaniaâ€™s border with this area of Mozambique. There is also thought to be some support for Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL). The Tanzanian authorities have successfully made a number of arrests in connection to terrorism. However, many incidents in Tanzania are of unclear origin and may be conducted by criminal gangs.
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
