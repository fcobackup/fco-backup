The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to mainland Portugal
For the purpose of this travel advice, the term “European Area” refers to EU member states, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland.
Direct air travel to Portugal is permitted for any purpose from the UK, the European Area, Australia, Canada, China, Georgia, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay.
Travel to, and transit through Portugal is permitted from countries other than those specified above for essential purposes only, such as to enable you to reunite with your family, or for professional, educational, health or humanitarian reasons.
Screening on arrival
If you are travelling to Portugal from the UK, the European Area, Australia, Canada, China, Georgia, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia or Uruguay, you will be subject to health screening on arrival at mainland airports and ports. Your temperature will be checked and if it is 38ºc or over or you show signs of being unwell, you will be referred to the health authorities at the airport. You may be required to take a COVID-19 test and to self-isolate at your accommodation until the test results are known.
If you are travelling to Portugal from any country other than those specified above, you will need to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test to airline staff prior to boarding, except if you are in direct transit and do not need to leave the airport. The test must have been carried out within 72 hours of departure. You can be refused boarding if you do not have proof of having taken a test, unless you are a Portuguese national or are legally resident in Portugal.
If you are a Portuguese national or are resident in Portugal and you travel without proof of a COVID-19 test, you will still need to take the test on arrival at the airport or independently within 48 hours. You will need to pay for the test and self-isolate until the results are known. You can be prosecuted if you do not comply with these requirements.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Entry to Madeira and Porto Santo

complete and submit a traveller questionnaire 12-48 hours before departure.
If you have one, upload proof of your negative COVID-19 test, carried out 72 hours before departure.
On arrival, you will be subject to health screening. If you have not uploaded your COVID-19 test result, you will be asked to show it at the airport. If you do not have proof of a COVID-19 test, you will be able to take a test at the airport and self-isolate at your accommodation until the results are known. This will take about 12 hours.
For further information, see the Madeira Tourist Board’s information for visitors.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Portugal. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Portugal guide and contact the Portuguese Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Portugal, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Portugal and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Portugal. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Portuguese Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Portugal before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Portuguese Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Portugal, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
Travelling with children
Portuguese Border Control (SEF) advise that a child under the age of 18 who is travelling to Portugal alone or without a parent or legal guardian should either:
be met at the airport or point of entry by their parent or guardian, or
carry a letter of authorisation to travel from their parent or guardian. The letter should name the adult in Portugal who will be responsible for them during their stay. There is no legal requirement for the letter to be notarised. However, the onus is on the parent or legal guardian to provide reasonable evidence, including contact details, to confirm that adequate care arrangements are in place.
Resident minors leaving Portugal
A child under the age of 18 who is resident in Portugal must carry a notarised letter of authority from their parent or guardian if they’re travelling out of the country alone or without a parent or legal guardian. The letter of authority can be issued by:
one of the child’s parents (if the parents are married)
the parent the child lives with (if the parents are separated or divorced)
one of the adoptive parents (if the child is adopted) or
the child’s legal guardian
Further information in English, together with a standard form of words (in Portuguese), are available on the Portuguese immigration service website
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs)
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Portugal.
