Future travel options
This travel advice and the British Embassy Skopje’s Facebook and Twitter accounts will be updated if departure options become available.
Some flight options, including operated to transit countries, could arise at short notice. Contact the British Embassy Skopje at BritishEmbassySkopje@fco.gov.uk if you are a British traveller seeking to return to the UK.
As borders reopen and restrictive measures ease, there may be options to return to the UK from neighbouring countries. You should check FCO travel advice of the relevant country for options.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
