Crime
Crime levels remain relatively high and police capacity is low. There are regular armed and violent robberies against businesses and individuals. There is a risk of passers-by being caught up in such incidents - the Police tend to respond with firearms if shot at or threatened.
Many of the crimes in Guyana are common to countries with wide gaps in wealth and where the perception is that all foreigners are wealthy. Muggings have taken place in broad daylight, often at gun or knife point. Burglary and theft from cars is commonplace. Take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. Try to avoid showing obvious signs of wealth.
Take extra precautions to safeguard your passports, money, tickets, mobile phones and other valuables. Even if you are staying with family, do not leave valuables in view. Keep them somewhere less obvious than your baggage. Use hotel safes if possible. You should be particularly vigilant when leaving local banks to ensure that you are not being followed.
In Georgetown, avoid the Tiger Bay and Albouystown areas and take care in Sophia, all of south Georgetown, Buxton and Agricola. Take particular care in the Stabroek Market area where robberies are a daily occurrence. Avoid walking alone around Georgetown, even in the main areas and don’t walk anywhere at night.
A number of assaults have taken place in the Botanic Gardens. Birding enthusiasts should be particularly vigilant. If possible go with an organised group and avoid taking valuables with you.
The COVID-19 Emergency Measures have banned activities, including walking, along the sea wall. Some public parks (such as the Botanic Gardens have also been closed.)
Local travel
You should take normal precautions. Confirm the local situation in advance, avoid travel after dark, travel in convoy whenever possible and carry a means of communication.
Guyana is vulnerable to flooding. The coast of Guyana is below sea level and protected by a sea defence and dam system. Guyana also experiences heavy rainfall. The main rainy seasons are generally May/June and December/January. Infrastructure, including drainage systems, is poorly maintained.
Road travel
If possible, avoid travel to and from Georgetown Cheddi Jagan international airport late at night and before dawn. There have been incidents of violence and fatal accidents caused by erratic driving. There have also been incidents of violent theft by gangs who follow cars travelling from the airport, and attack their victims when they reach their final destination. Always drive with windows closed and doors locked.
Driving in Guyana can be dangerous because of poor road sense of road-users, frequent hazards, inadequate lighting and poor road conditions in some areas. Drive defensively and limit driving at night as much as possible. The worst incidents have almost inevitably involved minibuses. When driving at night take extra care to avoid cyclists, pedestrians and animals.
If you’re planning to drive in Guyana, from 28 March 2019, a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) is recommended. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. Alternatively, you can get a local driving permit, valid for 1 month, from the Licence and Revenue Office in Georgetown on submission of a valid British driving licence.
If you’re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.
Avoid using minibuses. They are driven dangerously and are responsible for the majority of road accidents in Guyana.
Although some taxis have been the target for robbers, they remain the safest means for visitors to get around town. Only use taxis from reputable companies and book them in advance (or take them from official hotel taxi ranks). Don’t hail taxis from the roadside. 
Air travel
Tourist travel within Guyana can often involve flying in light aircraft. There has been the occasional accident in recent years on the main tourist routes, including Kaieteur Falls, Lethem and Linden, some with fatalities. The last fatality occurred in February 2019.
A list of recent incidents and accidents can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) is unable to offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
In 2016 the International Civil Aviation Organisation carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Guyana.
There are some restrictions in place on travel within Guyana. Foreigners travelling to Lethem need to apply to the COVID-19 Task Force for permission to travel.
River and sea travel
There have been armed attacks against fishing boats in and around the waters of Guyana and Suriname. Be vigilant and take appropriate precautions.
Only use scheduled ferry services when crossing the Corentyne River between Guyana and Suriname. Using water taxis (backtracking) from Suriname to Guyana is illegal and can lead to arrest, imprisonment and then deportation.
If you’re travelling on Guyana’s rivers use registered boat services equipped with lifejackets. Don’t travel by boat after dark.
Border areas
Venezuela disputes the legitimacy of its border with Guyana. Political tensions have increased following Venezuela’s decision to hold a referendum on 3 December 2023 on the status of the Essequibo region. The security situation may deteriorate in the border areas. 
Although the UN’s International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea in 2007 ruled on the maritime border dispute between Suriname and Guyana, there remains a historical border dispute between Suriname and Guyana over land in the New River Triangle area in the southeast of Guyana.  
Please regularly check for updates if travelling near the border areas, both of which are in remote areas. We advise anyone in those regions to follow the latest advice of local authorities.
Political situation
Following elections on 2 March 2020 a new government is now in place. In case of demonstrations you are advised to be careful when travelling around the country and avoid large crowds.
Mobile phones
The following UK mobiles work with roaming services - tri-band or quad phones; Vodafone and O2. A 3G data service is also available.
Electricity
Power cuts occur and you may find yourself without water or electricity for short periods of time. Consider packing a torch.
Hotel safety
A small hotel fire in the centre of Georgetown in August 2018 highlighted poor safety procedures in some hotels and the need to be vigilant. You should make yourself aware of evacuation procedures and exit routes on arrival and speak to hotel management if you have any concerns.
