This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.  
The authorities in Portugal set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Portuguese Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 requirements
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Portugal.
Passport validity requirements
Portugal follows Schengen area rules. Your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has either been reported lost or stolen or is damaged.
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area, which includes Portugal, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
The requirements for working in Portugal are different.  
If you’re travelling to other Schengen countries as well, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day visa-free limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days. If you overstay the 90-day visa-free limit, you may be banned from entering Schengen countries for up to 3 years.
Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit.
If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.
If your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
At Portuguese border control you may need to show:
an onward or return ticket
proof you have enough money for your visit
Staying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period
To stay longer, you must meet the Portuguese government’s entry requirements (in Portuguese).
If you’re in Portugal with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Read about passport stamping if you live in Portugal.
New Schengen entry requirements
Plans for the introduction of the new EU Entry/Exit System (EES) for all non-EU nationals, including British nationals, travelling in or out of the Schengen area has been delayed. Information will be updated when available.
Read more information on the EU Entry/Exit System.
Travelling with children
Non-resident children travelling to Portugal
Children aged 17 and under travelling to Portugal alone, or with a person who is not their parent or legal guardian, must either:
be met at the airport or point of entry by their parent or guardian
carry a letter of authorisation to travel from their parent or guardian. The parent/guardian’s signature must be certified by a solicitor or notary.
Make sure the letter includes:
the child’s dates of arrival and departure
the address where they will be staying
the name of the adult in Portugal who will be responsible for them during their stay
the full names, dates of birth, passport numbers and contact details of the parent or guardian
parent or guardian’s signature and date of issue
If you bring a child to Portugal without a properly certified letter of authorisation, your entry will be delayed and may be refused.
Teenagers aged 17 and under who travel alone, or with friends of the same age, and who are not being met, may be refused entry if they do not have a letter of authorisation.
Non-resident children leaving Portugal
Non-resident children aged 17 and under who leave Portugal alone, or with a person who is not their parent or guardian, must have a properly certified letter of authorisation unless they are returning to their country of origin.
Resident children leaving Portugal
A child aged 17 or under who is resident in Portugal must carry a properly certified letter of authorisation if travelling without their parent or legal guardian. See more details in the Living in Portugal guide.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s guides for Portugal, The Azores, Madeira and Porto Santo.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Portugal. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking food into Portugal
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.
