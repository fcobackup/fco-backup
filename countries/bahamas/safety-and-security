Local travel
Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands
Hurricane Dorian caused significant and widespread damage to the eastern part of Grand Bahama and the central and northern Abaco Islands in September 2019.
Ports in Grand Bahama are now operating as normal and a number of hotels and resorts there have reopened. Water, power and communications access has been restored to the majority of the island, except the eastern end.
In Abaco, significant damage was caused to critical infrastructure, including shelter, power and water supplies and communications access, though conditions are improving. Abaco is still rebuilding and recovery work is ongoing, however a few hotels are back up and running though with some difficulties. While scheduled flights are now operating to the Abaco Islands, there are still some challenges on the ground.
You should arrange your accommodation before you travel, and seek local advice on any continued disruption that could affect your individual itinerary. All other islands in The Bahamas remain unaffected.
Crime
There have been incidents of violent crime including robbery, which is often armed and sometimes fatal, in residential and tourist areas of New Providence, Grand Bahama and Freeport. The number of break-ins and robbery incidents reported to the British High Commission has increased. There are police patrols in the main tourist areas.
Be vigilant at all times and don’t walk alone away from the main hotels, tourist areas, beaches and downtown Nassau, particularly after dark. Take care if travelling on local bus services after dusk on routes away from the main tourist areas. Don’t carry large amounts of cash or jewellery. Robbers may be armed. Don’t resist in the event of an attempted robbery. If you need the police in an emergency, call 911 or 919.
The outlying islands of the Bahamas (known as the Family or Out Islands) have lower crime rates.
Excursions and activities
Before booking any excursion or activity make sure that health and safety precautions are evident and that the operator has adequate insurance cover.
The water sports industry in The Bahamas is poorly regulated. Be careful when renting jet skis and other water sports equipment as many companies and individuals offering water sports activities are unregistered. People have been killed or seriously injured using jet skis and other watercraft carelessly, or by the reckless behaviour of others. There have been reports of sexual assaults on foreign nationals by jet ski operators in Nassau.
Water safety
On 26 June 2019 there was a fatal shark attack in The Bahamas. While this is a very rare occurrence, the Bahamian authorities issued advice urging the public to exercise extreme caution in and around the waters of New Providence, adjacent islands and cays.
Road travel
You can drive in the Bahamas with a valid UK driving licence for up to 6 months. If you’re staying longer or living in the Bahamas, you’ll need to get a Bahamian driving licence.
Although traffic drives on the left-hand side of the road, most vehicles are imported from the United States and are left hand drive.
Consular assistance
There is no permanent consular representation at the British High Commission in Nassau. However, the British High Commission in Kingston, Jamaica, can provide consular support to British nationals. In the event of a genuine consular emergency in the Bahamas, telephone +1 242 225 6033 or +1 876 936 0700. This number should not be used for passport or visa queries.
