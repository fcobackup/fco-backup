Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Pakistan.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Pakistan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Pakistan High Commission in London or nearest Pakistani consulate.

Visas for journalists often have extra travel restrictions. Follow the terms of your visa, or you could be fined or detained.  
Returning to the UK 
You must have a valid visa, a Pakistani national identity card or a valid Pakistani passport to leave.  
If you are travelling on a British passport and your visa has expired, you may not be allowed to board your flight unless you have a visa extension or an exit visa. Contact the Ministry of Interior or see the Directorate General of Immigration and Passports for information on visa extensions and exit visas.

Travelling with children 
If you’re travelling with a child as a single parent or are not the child’s parent, you may need to provide documentary evidence of parental responsibility before leaving Pakistan. This is particularly likely if the child is of Pakistani origin. 
Travelling through Pakistan 
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against travel to most of the Pakistan-Afghanistan and Pakistan-Iran border areas. FCDO advises against all travel to Afghanistan and Iran.

The Torkham border crossing with Afghanistan is open to people with valid passports and Pakistan visas. You can apply for a visa on the Ministry of Interior website.  
Illegal entry to Pakistan is a serious offence. If you cross from Afghanistan without the correct documentation you may be detained or deported. If you do enter Pakistan illegally, you will not be able to travel onward from Pakistan.
