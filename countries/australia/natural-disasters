Bushfires
Be aware of the risk of bushfires, especially at the height of the Australian summer (November to February). Bushfires can start and change direction with little or no notice. If you’re travelling in a high risk bushfire area, follow local authorities’ advice. For the latest bushfire information, see: Victoria; South Australia; New South Wales, Tasmania, Western Australia, Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. The New South Wales rural fire service also has a useful ‘Fires Near Me’ app.
Flooding
Heavy rain and tropical cyclones can cause flooding in some areas. Follow local media and check with local state authorities for the latest flooding information: Queensland and New South Wales.
Tropical cyclones
Tropical Cyclones occur in some parts of Australia, mainly Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. The Cyclone season normally runs from November to April.
Monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology website for updates. See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you’re caught up in a storm.
Dust storms
Dust storms occur regularly in Australia, usually only in outback areas.
