Crime
There is a low rate of serious crime in Switzerland. However, the British Embassy has received increased reports of theft especially in larger cities, at Geneva airport and on trains to/from Geneva.
Take sensible precautions to avoid mugging, bag snatching and pickpocketing. Be particularly vigilant at airports, railway stations and crowded public gatherings. Do not leave your valuables unattended. The emergency number for the Police is 117.
Road travel
In 2021 there were 186 road deaths in the Switzerland (source: Department for Transport). This equates to 2.2 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.6 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2019.
If you are planning to drive in Switzerland, see information on Driving Abroad.
Licences and documents
Drivers must be 18 years of age and hold a full valid UK, or other EU/EEA driving licence, insurance and vehicle documents.
When driving in Switzerland, you should always have your:
driving licence
car papers
insurance paper
MOT/Control technique certificate
passport or ID and those of your passengers
If you’re living in Switzerland, check the Living in Switzerland Guide for information on requirements for residents.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. From 28 September 2021 UK stickers have replaced GB stickers. Check the GOV.UK Displaying number plates website for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.
Driving regulations
Road users have to comply with Switzerland’s traffic laws, such as speed limits, rules on alcohol intake and child security. Traffic regulations are strictly enforced. Any serious breach of the regulations can result in heavy fines and/or imprisonment.
A reflective jacket and a warning triangle are compulsory and must be kept within easy reach (not in the boot). You must also have a first aid kit in the car. Radar detectors are prohibited in Switzerland (whether in use or not). The limit for alcohol in the bloodstream is 0.05% and police may request any driver to undergo a breath test or drugs test.
The speed limit on Swiss motorways is 120km/h unless otherwise indicated. Serious traffic offences (including driving over the speed limit) can lead to criminal prosecution. You may face detention while awaiting trial. There is no standard penalty because sentencing varies from canton to canton. Fines for excessive speeding will be related to the yearly gross income of the offender.
If you receive a traffic fine while driving in Switzerland you might be asked to pay on the spot. If you wish to challenge the fine, you can appeal in writing to the competent Swiss authority by the deadline, giving your reasons and presenting documentary proof. Fines can be enforced for a period of 3 years. This is to encourage foreign motorists who wish to re-enter Switzerland to pay their fine. Unpaid fines can result in a prison sentence.
Motorways
You must purchase and display a vignette (sticker) to travel on Swiss motorways or face large fines. You can buy a vignette at most border crossings, petrol stations, post offices, by phone (+800 1002 0030) and online. The price of a vignette is currently CHF 40.
Motorway journeys are usually trouble-free, but if you´re involved in a car accident, use the orange emergency phones to ask for help.
Road conditions
Many roads outside of urban areas are narrow and winding, and road conditions can deteriorate fast (even in summer) especially during heavy rainfall and subsequent snowfall at higher altitudes. You should reduce your speed significantly to suit the conditions.
Alpine winters often make driving more difficult. You should equip your car with winter tyres and snow-chains, and check road conditions prior to departure. You should carry water, food, warm clothing and medicines in your vehicle.
You can find the latest information on road conditions on the websites of the Swiss Touring Club (in German, French and Italian). See the AA and RAC guides on driving in Switzerland.
Accessibility
The official website of Switzerland Tourism provides useful information for travellers in a wheelchair or with impaired mobility.
Outdoor sports activities
Hiking, mountaineering and other adventure sports are increasingly popular activities. Unfortunately each year there are incidents with visitors getting into difficulty and needing the help of the emergency services. There have been a number of tragic accidents involving British visitors, including during extreme sports activities.
If you’re taking part in extreme sports, check that the company is well established in the industry and that you’ve arranged for your travel insurance to cover the specific activity. For sports activities like skiing, potholing and mountaineering, and for sports classed as particularly dangerous (e.g. off-piste skiing, mountain biking, climbing, paragliding or BASE jumping), your insurance should include mountain rescue services, helicopter costs and repatriation to your country of residence or possible transfer to neighbouring countries for treatment.
Check weather forecasts and conditions and make sure you’re properly equipped for the worst-case scenario. A map, compass, GPS and telecommunication equipment should always be used when travelling outside urban areas. Don’t undertake any activity alone, and consider hiring a guide for expert advice. Always leave copies of your itinerary with someone.
The following alpine hazards exist throughout the year:
avalanches and snow drifts
landslides and flooding
glacial crevasses and hollows
rock fall
thunder storms and lightning
altitude sickness
sun exposure
sudden weather changes
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Switzerland. See Health.
To check the latest avalanche risk, visit the website of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology. Observe all warnings about avalanches and where appropriate consider carrying search equipment. Conditions on roads in mountainous areas can quickly become difficult in winter. You should carry water, food, warm clothing and medicines in your vehicle.
Off-piste skiing is highly dangerous. You should follow all safety instructions carefully given the danger of avalanches in some areas and particularly during times of heavy snow. Avalanche beepers (receivers) are the most common rescue devices and when properly used provide the fastest way of locating an avalanche victim.
