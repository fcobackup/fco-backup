Most visits to Madagascar are trouble-free. If possible, you should travel with established organisations or travel companies who know the terrain and have the capacity to warn of potential hazards.

You will need a visa to enter Madagascar. You can get a tourist visa on arrival at the airport or an e-visa online before you travel. See Visas
President Rajoelina was inaugurated on 19 January 2019 following two rounds of elections. Whilst violence during the elections was low, political demonstrations and other protests may still occur. Due to the possibility of violence at these events, you should avoid all protests and demonstrations, including those taking place in the area around Independence Square (“La Place du 13 mai”) and the Town Hall in Antananarivo. See Political situation
Take great care and follow local advice in the south-east of the country. In the southern triangle between Ihosy, Toliara/Tuléar and Fort-Dauphin the security situation remains tense and the roads are in very poor condition. If travelling in the area you’re advised to use a recognised tour operator and to avoid travelling at night. You’re advised not to travel by taxi-brousse (bush taxi). Avoid overnight stays in the countryside. See Local travel - Southern Madagascar
Seek local advice and guidance before visiting beaches. You should remain vigilant when visiting beaches to the South and North of Toliara (Tuléar) as there have been attacks and robberies. Avoid visiting isolated and remote beaches, especially alone.
The cyclone season in Madagascar normally runs from November to April.

You should avoid travelling at night on Route Nationales (RNs) particularly RN 13 between Ambovombe and Ihosy and on the RN 10 between Betioky and Andranovory (the western route to Toliara/Tuléar).
