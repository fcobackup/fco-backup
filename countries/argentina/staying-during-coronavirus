This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Argentina as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Argentina to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Argentina
In Argentina, measures to control the spread of COVID-19 have been extended until at least midnight on 9 April. The whole of the country is now in a phase of mandatory social distancing. The restrictions imposed may vary between jurisdictions.
In all parts of Argentina you must cover your nose and mouth with a face mask or other garment whenever you go out in public.
Under mandatory social distancing, free movement is allowed within each jurisdiction as long as social distancing rules are adhered to. Some provinces may introduce curfews. You should make sure you understand and comply with the measures in place in the province you are in. The use of public transport within jurisdictions remains restricted to essential workers and those in need of medical treatment.
Movement between jurisdictions is permitted, provided you meet the requirements of the specific jurisdiction/province you plan to visit. Requirements might include taking a COVID-19 PCR test, applying for a permit to circulate (Certificado Único de Circulación) or a summer certificate (Certificado Verano) amongst others. You must check the requirements and protocols in place in each jurisdiction/province here (in Spanish) and make sure you meet them ahead of travelling. You must also check and comply with the requirements of the province you are in and of each province you plan to travel through if travelling by land. You could be subject to a financial penalty if you do not abide by local regulations.
All arrivals into the City of Buenos Aires must take a COVID-19 test within 72 hours of arriving. Online booking is required. Children under the age of 12 are exempted. Full details on this requirement including information on where you can take the test and how to book are available in the City of Buenos Aires website (in Spanish).
Visas
The 90-day permission for tourists to stay in Argentina is being extended each month by 30 days, if your original 90 days expired after 17 March 2020. The latest extension was announced on 19 February.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Argentina
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notification.
Argentina’s national vaccination programme began in late December 2020. Vaccination is occurring in priority phases and is voluntary and free of charge. You must hold a DNI (national ID) to qualify for a vaccine. Each province/jurisdiction is responsible for the distribution of the vaccines in their area. Further information on Argentina’s national vaccination programme, including priority list, the status of the rollout in each province and enrolment details is available on the Argentine Ministry of Health website (in Spanish).
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
