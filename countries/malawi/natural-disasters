Earthquakes
In 2009, there were a series of earthquakes in northern Malawi around Karonga. Some of them registered up to 6.2 on the Richter scale, and caused deaths and damage to buildings. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
