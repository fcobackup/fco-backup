The authorities have directed airports to close and suspended all domestic and international commercial passenger flights until 31 May 2021. Land borders are also closed
As you cannot leave Myanmar at this time, see advice on staying in Myanmar during coronavirus.
Flights
Since 1 February all Airports have been closed and all flights cancelled, including the relief flights, until further notice.
Prior to 1 February, Myanmar Airways International and Korean Air were operating some relief flights from Yangon to Seoul. There has been an announcement that relief flights to Seoul have been suspended by the airline until further notice. The Myanmar Airways International website and Korean Air website will provide the latest information, requirements and ticket bookings when air travel reopens.
When air travel reopens, connections to the UK via Seoul are normally available but there are strict rules on transit passengers and these are subject to change regularly. Speak to the South Korean Embassy before booking to check the latest details.
Your temperature will be checked on arrival and if high, a COVID test will follow. A positive result will lead to hospitalisation in South Korea.
There may be additional relief flights organised by other airlines and to other destinations after the flight ban has been lifted. You should contact airlines for information on flight schedules and any additional requirements. Please contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you are travelling to before booking to check the latest details, including transit rules.
Your airline may need a negative COVID-19 test result prior to travel as well as a confirmed onward ticket. Check directly with the airline for the most up to date information.
Testing in Myanmar can be provided by the National Health Laboratory in Yangon (telephone: +95 1 371957) or the Public Health Laboratory in Mandalay (telephone 02 39839). There is a cost for this test, and the process can be lengthy and subject to change at short notice. You must register in person for an appointment and be prepared to present your flight ticket and passport. This is so that the Laboratory can confirm you’re booked onto a relief flight and registered as a passenger with the Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs. You may wish to confirm with your airline in advance of booking a test that you have been registered with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The British Embassy have not been informed by the government of Myanmar of any requirement for them to provide a letter to support requests for a test by British nationals. If the Laboratory asks for this, you should inform them of your flight booking and registration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Not securing a test may impact your ability to travel to your destination.
