Future travel options
The Minister of Health suspended all direct flights between the UK and Albania on 22 December. With effect from Monday 12 April 2021, this restriction is being lifted and flights are able to resume. The requirement for those arriving from the UK to self-isolate for 14 days has also been lifted. We recommend you continue to liaise closely with your airline before travelling as the situation can change at very short notice. On returning to the UK, you will be expected to follow the UK rules, including self-isolation as appropriate.

If you are worried about overstaying in Albania due to international travel restrictions, you should send a request via e-mail to migracioni.tirane@asp.gov.al and policiakufitare@asp.gov.al and request an extension to your stay in Albania. You should attach your travel document to the e-mail. You should retain the confirmation e-mail as you will need to show it at the police checkpoint when you exit Albania once travel restrictions are removed.
Travelling to the airport
Public transport and taxis are operating as normal.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If you cannot leave Albania
