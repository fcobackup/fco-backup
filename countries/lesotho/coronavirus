There are no confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Lesotho. However the Lesotho authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Lesotho. This is due to the South African authorities announcing measures restricting individuals entering South Africa if they have come from countries affected by coronavirus including the United Kingdom.
Travel restrictions and borders
Visitors to Lesotho must travel through, or transit via, South Africa. Since 18 March, South Africa has put in place travel restrictions and visa requirements for individuals from countries affected by coronavirus, including the United Kingdom. This impacts British Nationals wishing to enter and leave Lesotho. On 23 March the South African President announced further restrictions for everyone in South Africa.
British Nationals in Lesotho are not currently permitted to leave Lesotho by road into South Africa without a visa.
British National are currently permitted to transit through OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg if they are continuing to another international destination and their route does not involved passing through South African immigration controls.
A number of the border crossing points between South Africa and Lesotho have been closed including the crossing points at Tele Bridge, Peka Bridge and Sani Pass.
Follow our travel advice for South Africa and consult your nearest South African High Commission for further information.
Local Measures
All travellers arriving in Lesotho will be screened for coronavirus. You should comply with any additional screening measures by the authorities if asked to go through extra checks. Anyone showing symptoms of coronavirus may be placed in an isolation facility in a government hospital.
All individuals who have been in coronavirus affected areas within the past 14 days, including the UK, are required to self-isolate for 14 days. The Prime Minister of Lesotho recently announced that this self-isolation period will take place in a government-nominated hotel at the visitorâ€™s expense.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lesotho High Commission. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Medical Care
Medical care in Lesotho is limited. Most expatriates use medical facilities in South Africa. Access to these facilities is currently restricted due to the new South African visa requirements.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
