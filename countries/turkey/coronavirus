Entry and borders
Passengers who are not Turkish nationals or residents of Turkey are not permitted to enter Turkey.
Some airlines are operating flights to Turkey on an occasional basis to repatriate Turkish nationals and residents of Turkey from abroad. Passengers on these flights are subject to medical evaluation on landing and may be subject to enforced quarantine at a government run quarantine facility, or be required to self-isolate at home. You should refer to the operating airline and your nearest Turkish Embassy before you travel, to ensure you are permitted to enter Turkey on these flights.
Land crossings with Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, Iran and Iraq have also been closed.
Domestic and international travel
There are extremely limited international flights. See Return to the UK

The existing on-going curfew also remains in place for those aged over 65, those born after 1 January 2000, and those who have a chronic medical condition. People in these categories must not leave their homes.
Those aged between 18 and 20 and working in the public or private sector, or as a seasonal worker in the agriculture sector, can leave home if they have the necessary documents and permissions to show to the security forces. Those in these categories who must travel or leave home may do so after requesting official permission via the designated phone lines: 112, 155, and 156.
Local measures
The wearing of masks is obligatory in crowded places and specifically in markets and supermarkets. The wearing of masks is also compulsory on all public transport, including Metro, buses and ferries, and in some areas, masks must be worn when travelling in private vehicles with more than one person. Measures may vary across provinces and new measures may be introduced at short notice. Follow Turkish announcements and local media for up to date information.
