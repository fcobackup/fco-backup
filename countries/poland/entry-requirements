The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and is the UK government’s understanding of the current rules. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the entry rules. If you’re unclear about any of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.

For all other travellers not covered by the above exemptions quarantine rules vary depending on where you are travelling from:
If you enter Poland directly from the United Kingdom, and do not meet any of the exceptions listed above, you cannot take a COVID test before arrival to exempt yourself from self-isolation. You must self-isolate on arrival but can end your self-isolation if you take a COVID test after entering Poland and that test is negative. The test can be a PCR or antigen test. Most airports in Poland have test facilities within or close to the perimeter of the airport. Some may require advance booking therefore check the website of the airport where you will be arriving for more information about COVID-19 testing facilities. Similar arrangements apply to arrivals in Poland from most other countries in the world.
If you enter Poland by ferry or across the land border from Germany, Lithuania, Czech Republic or Slovakia and you live in Poland you must self-isolate for 10 days on arrival unless you meet one of the exemptions listed above. If you are only visiting Poland from one of these countries you must have a negative Covid test result issued in the 48 hours prior to arrival. Both PCR and lateral-flow antigen tests are acceptable. You can end self-isolation if you take a Covid test in Poland within 48 hours of arrival and that test result is negative.
If you enter Poland by air from another EU or Schengen country you must have a negative Covid test result issued in the 48 hours prior to arrival in Poland. Both PCR and lateral-flow antigen tests are acceptable. If you do not have a negative test result issued in the 48 hours before arrival you must self-isolate for 10 days, unless you meet one of the exemptions listed above. Failure to show a negative test result at check-in could see the airline refusing to allow you to board. You can end self-isolation if you take a Covid test in Poland within 48 hours of arrival and that test proves negative.
In addition, regardless of when and how you arrived in Poland, you must self-isolate if you develop any coronavirus symptoms or if you are notified that you have come into contact with someone who is infected or potentially infected with coronavirus. You must follow the advice of a medical professional who may instruct you to self-isolate for longer than 10 days.
If you live with someone who has tested positive you must self-isolate for at least 7 days (or longer if you also test positive). If you live with someone who must self-isolate but has not tested positive, you are not required to self-isolate (unless you later develop symptoms).
If you suspect you are infected with COVID-19 you must contact the Ministry of Health 24 hour hotline on 800 190 590 and press 6 for English language advice. A list of hospitals equipped to deal with coronavirus patients can be found on the Polish Government website.
If you are self-isolating you must not walk your dog or go shopping. You must not visit your doctor unless instructed to do so by them and you may leave your place of stay if you are required to travel to a COVID-19 testing centre.
Entry to Poland
Entry checks remain in place on land borders with Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. You may also face checks arriving through checkpoints from Germany, Lithuania, Slovakia or Czech Republic with the possibility for queuing traffic at peak times. Some countries also have checks in place on exiting Poland and if you travel to another country from Poland you may need to self-isolate in that country. Check country specific FCDO travel advice for any country that you plan to visit for details.
British nationals do not need a visa to enter Poland or any other EU/EFTA country. Poland now allows direct flights into its territory from a wide number of countries. The list of countries from which flights are not permitted could change at short notice and is updated on the Polish Government website (in Polish).
Regular entry requirements
Visas 
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:

if you are travelling to Poland and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Polish government’s entry requirements. Check with the Polish Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Poland with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit

At Polish border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay

You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents

UK nationals resident in Poland
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Poland. If you are resident in Poland, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel.

If you are a Polish passport holder you will be treated as a Polish national while in Poland, even if you hold a passport from another country.
