Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Benin.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 118 and ask for an ambulance.
Outside Cotonou, there may not be an emergency response. You are likely to have to get local advice and arrange transport to the nearest medical centre. 
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Benin
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Benin, including:
yellow fever
malaria

HIV
The 2022 UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic estimated that around 72,000 adults aged 15 or over in Benin were living with HIV. The prevalence percentage was estimated at around 0.8% of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage in adults in the UK of around 0.25%. You should exercise normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Healthcare in Benin
Medical facilities are poor, particularly in rural areas. Emergency medical facilities are extremely limited. For serious medical treatment, medical evacuation is necessary. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
