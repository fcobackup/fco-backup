Travel to Ireland is subject to entry restrictions
All arrivals, including Irish residents, arriving from overseas must complete a Public Health Passenger Locator Form prior to arriving in Ireland. The form may be used by health authorities to contact passengers in order to verify their location in the country.
In general, people are requested to restrict their movements for 14 days when they arrive into Ireland from another country. This applies to all travellers, including Irish citizens and people with no symptoms. Arrivals from Northern Ireland are exempt, as are people in certain defined categories as set out on the Irish Government’s website.
Ireland is implementing the EU ‘traffic lights’ approach to travel, which applies to countries in the EU/EEA and UK. In line with the EU ‘traffic lights’ approach a combined indicator map will be published each week by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Passengers from “green” regions are not required to restrict their movements for 14 days on arrival in Ireland.
Passengers arriving from an “orange”, “red” or “grey” region are requested to restrict their movements for 14 days (other than in the case of the defined categories listed on the Irish government website). At present, this continues to include arrivals to Ireland from Great Britain.
Until further notice, passengers arriving into Ireland from Denmark are requested to self-isolate for 14 days after their arrival, including those travelling for an essential purpose.
With effect from midnight 29 November passengers arriving from an “orange, “red” or “grey” region can end their period of restricted movement if they receive a negative /‘not detected’ result of a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test taken a minimum of five days after their arrival in Ireland. Passengers wishing to obtain a post-arrival test should seek an appointment for a test in advance of travel, should note that the test will be provided by private commercial sector testing supply and will be paid for by passengers. Such passengers should wait for their negative test result to be returned before ending the period of restricted movements.
