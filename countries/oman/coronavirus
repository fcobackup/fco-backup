International travel
A limited schedule of international flights has resumed but there are no direct flights between Oman and the UK. Travellers who have been in or transited through the United Kingdom in the previous 14 days cannot enter Oman, with the exception of Omani citizens.
British citizens with valid residence permits can enter Oman, unless they have been in or transited the United Kingdom in the previous 14 days.
British nationals over the age of 16 must:
take a PCR test no more than 72 hours before arrival in Oman;
complete an online pre-registration form;
have proof of hotel accommodation for mandatory self-isolation (booked through the HMushrif app);
travel/health insurance which covers at least 30 days of COVID-19 treatment;
take a PCR test on landing;
complete 7 days self-isolation; and
take a PCR test on day 8.
If you are aged 18 or over, you should self-isolate at a hotel in Oman at your own expense. This must be booked via the HMushrif app.
Exceptions are in place if you are 60 years of age or over or have a document from your health provider stating that for medical reasons you cannot self-isolate in a hotel. You are also exempt if you are under 18 years old and travelling unaccompanied. In these circumstances you must self-isolate at home for 7 days.
If your test on day 8 is negative, there is no need to continue self-isolating.
You should stay in touch with your airline, hotel and monitor local media before you travel.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Oman
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Omani Ministry of Health has identified priority target groups for the COVID-19 vaccine. If you are a British national resident in Oman and fit within a priority group, please contact the Ministry of Health on 1144 for details on how to get vaccinated.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
