This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Timor-Leste set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Timor-Leste
The Government of Timor-Leste has stopped the implementation of the State of Emergency. The latest one ended on 28 November 2021. Entry to national territory continues to be subject to screening. On arrival, all passengers travelling to Timor-Leste are required to present a valid COVID-19 vaccination certificate showing that a full dose (two doses) have been received. The requirement to be in possession of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, has been lifted.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Quarantine requirements
Travellers who have received a full vaccination (two doses) and are able to present a valid COVID-19 vaccination certificate, are exempted from mandatory quarantine upon arrival. Travellers who have not received a full vaccination for COVID-19 shall undertake 10 days mandatory quarantine designated by the competent authorities of the Ministry of Health. Alternatively, they could undertake home quarantine provided that the facility is suitable and with the authorisation from the Director General of Public Health Service. Those travellers, who for some health reason are not able to be vaccinated against COVID-19, should bring a letter of justification from their doctor. Upon arrival it should be presented to the health authorities.
Testing on departure
Those wishing to leave Timor-Leste will be subject to the entry requirement of their destination country. Bring your valid COVID-19 vaccination certificate with you, when departing the country. The situation in Timor-Leste can change quickly. In exceptional cases, the Government may introduce temporary border closures.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
A tourist visa costs US$30 and can normally be issued to the holder of a valid British passport on arrival at Dili International airport or Dili seaport, provided entry into Timor-Leste is regarded as being for a legitimate purpose. The visa will be valid for a single entry and will allow you to stay for up to 30 days.
British Citizens intending to enter the country via the Indonesia (West Timor) land border crossing at Atambua/Batugade need to apply in Kupang for a tourism visa in advance. This visa will generally be valid for a single entry and a duration of up to 30 days.
In Dili, tourism visas can be extended to a total of 90 days, for a fee.
If you plan to travel overland (rather than by the ferry) to the exclave of Oecussi you’ll need to apply for an additional visa. You must present your round trip ticket and complete the required forms at your nearest Timor-Leste embassy or consulate, or in Dili, prior to travel. For information on other types of visa see the Immigration Department of Timor-Leste.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Timor-Leste.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for exit from Timor-Leste only. You can’t use an ETD to enter the country. If you wish to transit Timor-Leste, you should contact the Immigration Department of Timor-Leste before you travel to confirm the requirements.
