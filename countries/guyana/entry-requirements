This page has information on travelling to Guyana.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Guyana set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Guyana’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
British nationals do not need visas to visit Guyana. Visitors are generally given 30 days to remain in Guyana, but extensions can usually be obtained from the Ministry of Home Affairs in Georgetown. The Guyanese authorities are very severe on visitors who overstay or abuse the conditions of their stay. Conviction for overstaying will result in one year imprisonment, a fine of up to G$50,000 (Guyana dollars) and deportation - at the deportee’s expense - upon release.
Effective from 7 October 2022, the Ministry of Health Guyana has removed the COVID-19 vaccination requirement for entry into Guyana.
You do not need to take any COVID-19 tests before you travel or after you arrive.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
