International travel
In response to the spread of a new strain of COVID-19, on 20 December 2020, the Ministry of Interior announced the suspension of all international flights for travellers entering and leaving the Kingdom (except in exceptional cases). On 3 January 2021, the Saudi Government announced that the suspension of entry into the Kingdom would be lifted from 11am on Sunday 3 January.
The Saudi authorities require anyone who is travelling from a country where the new strain of COVID-19 has spread to spend at least 14 days outside the affected country before entering the Kingdom. This includes travellers from the UK.
You should keep up to date with information from your airline or tour operator on the impact on any existing travel plans.
