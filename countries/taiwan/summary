All passengers arriving directly from the UK, or those who have been in the UK in the previous 14 days, will be required to complete their mandatory 14 day quarantine at a designated quarantine centre
From 23 December 2020, the frequency of direct flights from the UK to Taiwan will be reduced. Any passengers should contact their airline directly if they believe they may be impacted.
Foreign nationals are permitted to enter Taiwan provided they are not entering for tourism or to visit friends. You will need to apply for a visa before travelling.
Foreign nationals entering Taiwan must provide a negative COVID-19 test report completed in the three working days prior to boarding their flight.
Travellers from destinations designated as low risk by local authorities may be eligible for a reduced self-isolation period.
Limited transits are now permitted.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
Check our advice on foreign travel during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and sign up for email alerts for this travel advice.
If you’re planning travel to Taiwan, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
The UK does not recognise Taiwan as a state and has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan, so limited consular services are available to British nationals. See Consular assistance
There are over 60,000 visits to Taiwan by British nationals annually. Most visits are trouble-free.
Crime levels are low, but small-scale petty crime does exist. You should maintain at least the same level of vigilance as you would at home, and take sensible precautions. See Crime
There has been a significant increase in cases of dengue fever. See Health
You should not enter Taiwan with animal products without prior authorisation as those caught smuggling products may face heavy fines. See Customs regulations
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Taiwan, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
You can contact the emergency services by calling 110 (police) or 119 (ambulance and fire).
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
