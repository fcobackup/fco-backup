We are working with other embassies and Qatar Airways to arrange a commercial flight departing Jordan on Monday 20 April.
The flight will be to Doha with onward travel to the UK. If you are interested in purchasing a ticket for this flight, please send an email to cons.amman@fco.gov.uk by 23:59 hours on Wednesday 15 April and include the following information:

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you cannot leave Jordan at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well *consult your insurance provider, tour operator and transport or accommodation provider about the impact of the situation n your plans
