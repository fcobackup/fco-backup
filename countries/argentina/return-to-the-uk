There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Argentina, and no direct flights. Borders remain open for departure, but there are only a limited number of exceptional international flights.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Argentina. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Argentine authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
UK special flights
The UK operated two special flights from Argentina to help British travellers most at risk from the effects of COVID-19 to return to the UK. The flights departed on 7 and 12 May. There are currently no further UK special flights from Argentina.
This travel advice will be updated with further information on any future special flights and other options to leave the country as soon as this is available.
Stay up to date with this travel advice and follow the British Embassy social media accounts for any updates.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
