Eritrea is a completely cash-based economy. There are no credit card or ATMs facilities in Eritrea. You will need to pay for everything in cash.
Eritrea’s national currency is the Nakfa (ERN), currently pegged at a rate of 15 Nakfa to one US dollar. Nakfa are not convertible outside Eritrea.
You are not permitted to take more than 1,000 Nafka out of Eritrea. You should convert any excess Nakfa back to hard currency at one of the ’Himbol’ exchanges in town, as there are limits to what can be converted at the ’Himbol’ branch at the airport. You will need the original currency transaction receipt.
If you are exiting Eritrea and you hold in excess of the 1,000 maximum limit, it will be confiscated. Where the amount exceeds ERN 5,000 you may face prosecution leading to a heavy fine, as well as a delay to your departure.
Most hotels in Eritrea will require you to settle your hotel bill in US dollars. It is illegal to use foreign currency to make purchases except at a limited number of officially recognised hotels. You should get a receipt for any such purchases.
