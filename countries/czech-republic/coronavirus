Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Czech Republic
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Czech Republic announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Czech Republic national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) and AstraZeneca vaccines. British nationals resident in Czech Republic who have public health insurance, are eligible to receive the vaccine through the Czech national vaccination programme in accordance with their rollout plan. If you are currently eligible for a vaccine, i.e. you have residency in the Czech Republic, public health insurance and are 5+, you can now register for a vaccine. As of 18 July 2022, anyone over the age of 18 is eligible for a second booster, which can be applied no sooner than 4 months after the first booster dose. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are being used as vaccine boosters in the Czech vaccination scheme.
From 11 June 2021, British residents who have private health insurance or are self-funded can register for a vaccine within the Czech health system. The Czech government has set a recommended price for self-payers of CZK 400 per dose. This may vary depending on the specific vaccination site.
Workers who are posted to the Czech Republic by their UK employer are eligible for a vaccine if they hold an S1 certificate. More information on the S1 certificate and how to apply is available on the Your Europe website. Details of the national vaccination programme and the online booking system are available on the Ministry of Health website.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in the Czech Republic, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Czech Republic, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
