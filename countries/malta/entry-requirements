The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Malta
As of 15 July flights to and from some countries has been extended to include the UK on the Visit Malta website. All arriving passengers must have completed a paper copy of both a public health and a passenger locator form. These are available at the Malta Airport website or enquire with your airline.
As of midnight on Friday 4 September Bulgaria has been removed from the list requiring arriving passengers to provide a negative COVID-19 test before travelling. Passengers arriving from Romania, Tunisia, the Czech Republic and certain regions of Spain are required to submit a negative COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test before boarding flights to Malta. Passengers who do not present this certificate can be asked to give a swab on arrival at Malta International Airport or be asked to self-quarantine in Malta upon arrival. The current list can be found on the Maltese Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs’ website The Maltese Government will regularly review the list of countries for which prior testing will be required.
Self-isolation
As of 15 July the list of passengers from certain countries who are exempt from self-isolation has been expanded to include the UK. The current list of exempt countries can be found on the Visit Malta website. If arriving from one of these countries passengers will need to certify they have resided in that country for at least 2 weeks prior to travelling. There will, however, be temperature checks for all arriving and departing passengers. Those passengers with a high temperature will be required to undergo a swab test. Further details on the procedures are explained on the Malta International Airport website.
You may not travel to Malta from a country not listed via one of the listed countries. If you wish to travel to Malta from a country not listed you will need prior permission from the Maltese authorities. You should contact your nearest Maltese Embassy or High Commission for more information.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Malta. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Malta guide and contact the Maltese High Commission if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen areafor up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Malta, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Malta and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Malta. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Maltese High Commission what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Malta before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Maltese High Commission for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Malta, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Malta.
