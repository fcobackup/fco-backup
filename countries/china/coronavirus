There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19). The virus originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, but cases have been confirmed in all provinces of China.
Healthcare
Medical facilities may come under strain in response to localised outbreaks. Designated hospitals have been established in each province to take patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Emergency medical facilities, except in Hubei, are largely functioning as normal but mandatory health checks and quarantine restrictions may delay or limit access to such care.
Travel restrictions and quarantine
From 28 March, China is suspending the entry into China of foreign nationals with visas issued before 27 March. The Chinese authorities have told the British Embassy in Beijing that this includes transit passengers. The only exemptions will be diplomatic, service, courtesy or C visas.
All international passenger flights to Beijing will be diverted to 12 designated airports in Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Shanghai Pudong, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou and Xi’an.
Regulations for arrivals from overseas is continuously changing. Passengers are subject to health checks (likely to involve nucleic acid or swab tests) upon arrival, including during transit. It can take hours or days for test results. Those failing health checks may be sent to a designated hospital for treatment. Those seated close to those who fail health checks may be required to undergo 14 days centralised quarantine where they first landed. All passengers who are able to transfer on to Beijing are subject to 14 days centralised quarantine.
Families, including those with children, have been separated upon entering quarantine. Those undergoing observation will be asked to cover the fees for their period of quarantine.
International airports including Shanghai and Guangzhou have introduced similar mandatory health checks and 14 day quarantine for all international arrivals, regardless of destination.
There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19. In Guangzhou, in particular, there are reports of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, especially of those who are black and minority ethnic, including additional enforced quarantine and testing, as well as hotels and businesses not serving clients. Before you travel, check with your airline, travel operator or hotel for any changes or restrictions.
China issued an order to ensure compliance with health and quarantine regulations at borders. Refusal to comply with procedures or testing put in place or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals.
Other measures
Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations.
Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Most cities and provinces require travellers to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level, and procedures vary.
The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory quarantine in response to fresh outbreaks is high. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice.
Authorities announced a partial lifting of travel restrictions in Wuhan on 8 April. Due to the severity of travel restrictions and difficulty accessing medical assistance, the FCO assisted the departure of British nationals and dependents via charter flights on 31 January and 9 February.
