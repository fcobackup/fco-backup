Tajikistan is mostly a cash-only economy. Only change money at officially authorised currency exchanges. Very few establishments accept credit cards and none accept travellersâ€™ cheques. There is an increasing number of ATMs in Dushanbe and other larger towns, but none in rural areas. US dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency; other currencies, apart from Euros or Russian roubles, may be difficult to exchange.
