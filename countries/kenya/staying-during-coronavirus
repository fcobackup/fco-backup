This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Kenya as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Kenya to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Kenya
A daily nationwide curfew is in effect from 9pm to 4am (local time). On 6 July, the curfew was extended for a further 30 days. During curfew hours, everyone must stay at home or indoors, except for essential service workers.
The restrictions of road, rail and air movements in and out of the Nairobi Metropolitan area, and Mombasa and Mandera Counties, were lifted at 4am on 7 July.
The Government of Kenya has directed that face masks must be worn in public places, except when dining, or when adhering to social distancing in hotels, gardens or on beaches.
All bars are closed until further notice. Public places, tourism and hospitality establishments, travel and tour companies, hotels and other accommodations, restaurants, eateries, food and beverage outlets and entertainment and recreation facilities have been allowed to reopen, provided they comply with Government of Kenya public health protocols, including 1.5 metre social distancing and the daily curfew.
The Government has directed that, in addition to public transport systems, social distancing rules – in the form of capacity restrictions – will also apply when using private vehicles, including taxis. Vehicles are limited to carrying 50% of their passenger capacity. This means five-seater vehicles will only be allowed to carry one passenger in addition to the driver, while seven-seater vehicles will only be allowed two passengers in addition to the driver.
The suspension of large gatherings, meetings, conferences and political events was extended for a further 30 days on 6 July.
Kenyan citizens have been advised to avoid crowded places and to work remotely where possible.
Visas
If you need to renew your visa, the Kenyan Immigration Department has announced that visitor pass extensions will be processed online from 13 April 2020. Guidance on how to do so, as well as apply for other forms of documentation such as residence permits, is available from the Kenyan Immigration Department.
Health
The government of Kenya has indicated that persons testing positive for COVID-19, but presenting as asymptomatic or with only mild symptoms, can expect to be directed to self-isolate at home if able to do so. Vulnerable persons will be prioritised for hospital care. Ministry of Health guidance is available.
Pharmacies and other shops selling essential products remain open, though business hours may be affected by the daily nationwide curfew.
The authorities are conducting random temperature screenings in spaces frequented by the general public. If you show signs or symptoms of coronavirus and are able to self-isolate, you can expect to be directed to do so. If you cannot self-isolate, you can expect to be taken into a State health facility by the Kenyan authorities.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Kenya and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This is a last resort option for those most in need and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
