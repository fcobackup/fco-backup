This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in The Bahamas set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to The Bahamas
Different rules apply to residents and visitors, fully vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers and different age groups. All travellers must submit a Bahamas Travel Health Visa Trip application. The health visa application is available from The Bahamas travel page. To be granted a visa all travellers over two years old need to submit either a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test certificate (unvaccinated travellers over 12 years old) or a Rapid Antigen test (vaccinated travellers and children aged 2 to 11) prior to arrival. The test must have been taken within 5 days prior to the date of arrival. An email response will be provided once the application is completed, followed by an approval or denial of the health visa. This confirmation must be presented upon arrival in The Bahamas. You should allow 72 hours to process. A fee may be payable for certain categories of unvaccinated traveller.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
In addition to the health visa requirements, health screening and social distancing measures are in effect at all international and domestic airports. You should expect longer waiting times on arrival.
Unvaccinated travellers over 12 years old who are staying in The Bahamas more than four nights / five days will be required to take a rapid antigen test and complete daily health questionnaires. More details are available at the Ministry of Tourism’s website.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
The Bahamas will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals visiting are usually allowed entry into the Bahamas for up to 21 days. This can be extended up to a maximum of 8 months by applying to the Department of Immigration in Nassau. Penalties for overstaying include fines and detention pending deportation.
If you require a visitor visa, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has an electronic visa application process. The official website is: https://mofa.gov.bs/obtaining-official-documents/visitors-visa/. Please email mofaconsular@bahamas.gov.bs for more information on visa processing fees and turnaround times.
For all other types of travel, seek advice from the Bahamian High Commission in London.
If you are travelling via the USA, you may need to apply for an ESTA. The Bahamas counts as part of the ‘contiguous territory and islands’ for US visa waiver purposes and time spent in The Bahamas counts towards the 90 day maximum permitted stay in the US under this waiver. If you travel to The Bahamas via the USA under US visa waiver arrangements and are in any doubt about your US visa status, you should seek advice from either the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service or any US diplomatic mission before starting your return journey.
If you’re concerned about your immigration status (e.g. overstaying a visa) due to the emergency restrictions, contact the Department of Immigration on 225 5337 or immigration@bahamas.gov.bs. Guidance on how to apply for an electronic extension to stay and other COVID-19 related immigration concerns has also been published on the Department of Immigration website.
