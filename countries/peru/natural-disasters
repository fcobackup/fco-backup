Earthquakes
Peru is in an active earthquake zone and there are frequent tremors. If in a building when an earthquake strikes keep away from the windows and make your way to the safe zones marked in most buildings with an ‘S’ sign. If you are outside keep away from buildings and other areas where objects, like trees or power lines, could fall.
To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Volcanoes
If you’re planning to visit areas of known volcanic activity, pay careful attention to all warnings and follow the advice of the local authorities. See the Ingemmet (Peruvian Institute of Geology and Mining) website for more information.
Tsunamis and High tides
Although tsunamis are rare in Peru higher tides are often experienced either after an earthquake or for other reasons throughout the year.
See the Peruvian Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation website for information.
Flooding and landslides
The rainy season in Peru runs from November to April. It can rain and snow heavily in the Andes and there have been occasions of torrential rains in some parts of the country, including Cusco.
During the rainy season land, rock and mudslides, or snow can cause disruption to road and rail travel as well as to walking routes in mountain and jungle areas. These normally include Cusco, the routes to Machu Picchu (including the alternative Santa Maria-Santa Teresa-hydroelectric plant route, and the Salkantay route), the route to Manu (in Cusco and Madre de Dios) and the north of Peru. River levels are also higher.
Take care when travelling in these areas during the rainy season and check the latest conditions with your tour operator. Monitor local media for updates on travel information before starting your journey and contact Iperu (the official source of information for tourists in Peru) beforehand.
