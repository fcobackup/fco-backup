This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Bosnia and Herzegovina Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Bosnia and Herzegovina, your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 90 days after the date you plan to leave
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid, undamaged travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to Bosnia and Herzegovina for up to 90 days within a 6-month period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
For all other types of travel, check the conditions for temporary residence or contact the Bosnia and Herzegovina Embassy in the UK.  
Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit. 
If you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit. If you do not have a stamp, the Border Police may fine you when you leave.
Staying longer than 90 days in a 6-month period
If you want to stay longer than 90 days within a 6-month period, apply for a residence permit. You must provide a document showing that you have no criminal record in the UK. The British Embassy is not able to issue such a document. You can get a copy of your police records before you travel.
For more information, see the Bosnia and Herzegovina government’s page about residency and work permits.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Bosnia and Herzegovina guide.
Registering your stay
All foreign nationals must register with the police within 72 hours of arrival, at a local police station. Hotels and some hostels will usually register their guests. If your accommodation is not arranging this, you need to contact the nearest field centre (‘terenski centar’) for the Service for Foreigners’ Affairs.
Travelling with children
Children aged 17 and under who are travelling unaccompanied or with an adult other than their parents, must carry a notarised letter giving permission for travel. The letter must be signed by a parent or guardian and give the name of the accompanying adult.
This also applies if only one parent is accompanying the child, particularly if they have a different surname to the child’s.  
For further information contact the Embassy of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the UK.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into and out of Bosnia and Herzegovina. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
