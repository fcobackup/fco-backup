The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Nicaragua.
There has recently been a period of street violence in many areas in Nicaragua. This has involved the use of tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition, resulting in serious injuries and deaths. Major routes have become impassable at times due to disorder. The situation at present appears calm but remains volatile. There continue to be marches and demonstrations that, while currently peaceful, have the potential for further violence and disorder. If you’re in Nicaragua, you should stay well away from all demonstrations and gatherings, even if apparently peaceful, as it is against Nicaraguan law for foreigners to join marches and participation risks arrest.
There is no British Embassy in Nicaragua. If you need emergency consular assistance, you should contact the British Embassy, Costa Rica, tel +506 2258 2025.
