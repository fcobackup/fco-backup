Hurricanes
The hurricane season in the Caribbean frequently coincides with heavy rains, which may cause flash floods and landslides. In the aftermath of a hurricane in Cuba, power, communications and water supplies can be disrupted. Even in holiday resorts, utility services canâ€™t be guaranteed. In the event of extreme weather conditions flights to and from Cuba may be delayed or cancelled.
You should closely monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator including any evacuation orders. Spanish language alerts are available from the Cuban Defensa Civil (Civil Defense) organisation.
See our Tropical Cyclones page for advice on what to do if you are caught up in a storm.
Earthquakes
Cuba is located in an active earthquake zone. Strong earthquakes occur infrequently and most seismic events pass unnoticed. If a natural disaster occurs, follow the advice of the local authorities.
To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see this advice from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
