All incoming flights to Malta were suspended as of 2359 on Friday 20 March. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Malta, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
The Maltese authorities have introduced a number of measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
