Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Cuba
All commercial and charter flights are suspended from entering or leaving Cuba until 31 July 2020, and this date may be subject to further review. No foreign sea vessels are allowed in Cuban waters until further notice. On sea vessels, there may be exceptions made by Cuban authorities on the grounds of health, fuel or technical problems. Under the government’s phased recovery plan, the current rules on entry are:
Cuban nationals and foreign residents can enter (Havana is the only airport, and only with repatriation flights at present);
no foreign visitors are allowed to enter the country until phase three of the national recovery plan, except for
from 1 July, tourists can come to Cuba again with international charter flights directly to these destinations: Cayo Coco, Cayo Cruz or Cayo Guillermo (served by Jardines del Rey airport); Cayo Santa Maria (flying into Santa Clara airport), or Cayo Largo del Sur., with luggage limits of one case of up to 32kgs per passenger plus hand luggage.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the Cuban immigration authorities or the nearest Cuban Embassy/Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
If coming to Cuba, you should pack sanitary hand gel, handkerchiefs and other essential items that may prevent transmission, as these items are not always available in Cuba.

Some electrical items with heavy power consumption may be confiscated on entry to Cuba. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are also subject to import requirements and may be confiscated. Confiscated items are normally returned on departure.

Travelling to Cuba from the USA
Travelling for tourism reasons directly from the USA to Cuba isn’t allowed under US law. The law applies to US nationals and all foreign nationals who are either resident in the USA, or travelling through the USA en route to Cuba. Those travelling on direct flights between the UK and Cuba, or via other countries excluding the USA, are unaffected by this US legislation.
Under certain conditions, travel is permitted from the USA to Cuba, including on the direct flights which operate between the two countries. Everybody travelling on these routes (both US citizens and foreign nationals) will need to comply with US law and travel for one of 12 permitted reasons/categories of travel. Tourism isn’t one of these 12 permitted reasons/categories. For more information see the US Department of the Treasury website and the US State Department’s travel advice for Cuba. For travel-specific questions, see the Code of Federal Regulations 31 C.F.R. 515.560 and the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) frequently asked questions.
