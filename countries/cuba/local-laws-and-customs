Cuba has strict regulations governing the export of antiques and artworks. You should obtain and keep the receipt for anything you purchase as it may be requested by Customs on departure. Some art and antiques need an export permit from the Country Heritage Office (known as Bienes Culturales). It is advisable to ask the vendor if this is needed and if they have the required permit for the item you are buying.
Professional photographers may need an import permit for their photography equipment, as well as the appropriate visa. The policy on importation of drones is under review and, for the time being, Cuban Customs advises visitors not to bring drones. They may be confiscated on arrival and would normally be returned on departure; but the process of reclaiming the drones could be lengthy.
Cuba has strict laws on unauthorised professional photography, and on taking unauthorised images of children, young people or women.
Cuba has strict laws on the use, possession or trafficking of illegal drugs. Cuban courts tend to hand out severe penalties for those convicted of drugs-related offences. Pack all luggage yourself and donâ€™t carry items for anyone else.
Cuba prohibits the import of all meat products and fruit. If you arrive in Cuba with any meat or fruit, it will be confiscated and destroyed.
Avoid military zones and other restricted areas. Be particularly careful when taking photographs or videos in these areas, which are not always clearly signposted.
If you are suspected of having caused injury to someone, or broken a law, you may not be allowed to leave Cuba during the investigation and trial, and could be detained, depending on the nature of the offence. You should contact the British Embassy as soon as possible.
The Cuban authorities take any breach of their immigration rules very seriously. In some instances, those who overstay are detained by the immigration authorities on departure and remain in detention while investigations are carried out.
Homosexuality is legal in Cuba, yet gender diversity is not fully understood nor accepted by the general population. Same sex marriages are recognised by law and were approved by a Referendum on the new Family Code in October 2022. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
