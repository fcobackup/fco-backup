Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Argentina. The Argentine authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The FCO strongly advise non-resident British nationals in Argentina to return to the UK as soon as possible. For information on how to return to the UK from Argentina, see Return to the UK
Borders and travel
Argentina’s borders are closed to foreign nationals and non-residents entering the country until midnight on 26 April. The borders remain open for departures. However, all scheduled international flights have been suspended, although the government is permitting a limited number of exceptional international flights.
There are no longer direct flights from Argentina to the UK. Some airlines continue to fly very limited routes back to the UK via third countries, although these are likely to be affected by the closure of Argentina’s borders. All flights are subject to change and cancellation at short notice. Travellers should regularly check availability with these airlines.

Local measures
Argentina is under a nationwide quarantine until midnight on 26 April. The quarantine was introduced on 19 March and has been extended twice, most recently on 10 April. Exemptions to the quarantine are for single person journeys to buy necessities, such as medicines or foodstuffs, in your local area, and to travel to an airport if you already have a flight booked.
Anyone outside their accommodation without justification may be charged with committing a public health crime.
Some provinces in Argentina have introduced further measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus. For example, in Catamarca, Salta, Jujuy, La Rioja, Misiones and Santiago del Estero it is now obligatory to cover your nose and mouth with a facemask or other garment when in public. You could be subject to a financial penalty if you do not abide by these regulations. You should therefore make sure you follow the advice of local authorities, wherever you are in the country.
