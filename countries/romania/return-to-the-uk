There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Romania.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
The suspension of international road and rail transport to and from Romania will end on 1 June.
Flights
Direct flights between Romania and the UK have been suspended by the Romanian Government. We know the suspension of flights is concerning for British people trying to leave Romania. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Romanian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Travelling to the airport
Due to movement restrictions in place, when travelling to the airport make sure you carry:
your passport
a Romanian movement declaration form, if you are moving between towns, cities, or counties in order to reach the airport, either electronically or in paper form
your flight ticket
Overland travel and transit
Road transit across or through Romania is possible. To transit by land across Romania cross at any open border post, and (if travelling before 1 June) fill in and carry a Romanian movement declaration form with details of your route across Romania. After 1 June this declaration form should no longer be required, although carrying evidence of your onward journey is a sensible precaution in case you are stopped by the authorities. Carry your passport at all times.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Romanian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
