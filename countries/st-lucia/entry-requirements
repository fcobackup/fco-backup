The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.

Passengers arriving with proof of a negative PCR (Polymerized Chain Reaction) test may be exempt from on-island testing and advance through immigration, baggage claim, customs and arrivals for transportation to their COVID-19 certified hotel, pre-approved home quarantine facility or Government Operated Quarantine Facility. Anyone arriving without proof of a negative PCR test will be subject to immediate isolation and testing at their own cost. It is recommended that visitors check their local government websites to identify PCR testing locations. You will need to check with an accredited private healthcare provider in the UK for PCR testing options.

Any symptomatic passengers will be isolated and tested.
