International travel
Regular international flights to and from India have resumed from 27 March 2022 in view of the decreasing cases of Covid-19. This means termination of air bubble arrangements and restoration to the pre-Covid level of services. To book and for more information you should check airline websites, which contain important guidance prior to travel. The British High Commission cannot assist with ticketing. The aviation sector remains unpredictable and is subject to change with limited notice.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
