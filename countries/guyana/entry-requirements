This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Guyana set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Passengers arriving into Guyana must obtain a negative COVID-19 PCR test, taken within seven days prior to their arrival. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to Guyana. You should arrange a private test. If you arrive with a test completed within 72 hours you will be allowed immediate entry into Guyana without restrictions.
Passengers with tests within four to seven days prior to arrival in Guyana will be subjected to a second PCR test at the point of entry but will be allowed to self-isolate in their hotel or home until a negative result is obtained. You will not be allowed on the plane at the point of departure if your test is more than 7 days old. The test on arrival costs GY$16,000.
Borders
The Governments of Brazil and Suriname have both announced the closure of borders with neighbouring countries, including Guyana. There is no exit/entry available to Venezuela. Guidance for travellers coming to Guyana from a COVID-19 affected country is available from the Guyana Ministry of Public Health. The Guyana Ministry of Public Health hotline is +592 624 3067 and +592 227 4986 ext 215.
Visas
British nationals do not need visas to visit Guyana. Visitors are generally given 30 days to remain in Guyana, but extensions can usually be obtained from the Ministry of Home Affairs in Georgetown. The Guyanese authorities are very severe on visitors who overstay or abuse the conditions of their stay. Conviction for overstaying will result in one year imprisonment, a fine of up to G$50,000 (Guyana dollars) and deportation - at the deportee’s expense - upon release.
Check entry requirements with the Guyana High Commission in London before you travel.
