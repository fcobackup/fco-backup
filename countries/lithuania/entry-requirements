The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lithuania
From 00:00 7 September 2020, British nationals resident in the UK will need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test on arrival in Lithuania. This is in addition to the requirement to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. The test must be a PCR swab test. Other test results, including antibody tests, are not accepted. The test must be taken no earlier than 72 hours before. Lithuanian border authorities will not consider text message confirmation of results as sufficient proof – proof of results must include the name of the individual, along with the date and time of the test. Lithuanian border authorities reserve the right to refuse entry to individuals who fail to comply with these requirements.
Individuals travelling to Lithuania by air or sea will need to complete a registration form prior to arrival. Registration forms can be filled out on paper during your journey, or in advance online. If you are travelling to Lithuania by land, you must complete the registration form within 12 hours of arrival.
On arrival in Lithuania from a country where the incidence of COVID-19 has exceeded 16 cases per 100,000 of population in the last 14 days, you must self-isolate for 14 days. It is recommended that you use your own vehicle or ask a member of your household to take you to your place of isolation. Updated information on which countries this applies to can be found on the Lithuanian Government Korona Stop website.
On arrival in Lithuania from a country where the incidence of COVID-19 has exceeded 25 cases per 100,000 of population in the last 14 days you must self-isolate for 14 days and present proof of a negative COVID-19 test carried out up to 72 hours before your arrival in Lithuania. Updated information on which countries this applies to can be found on the Lithuanian Government Korona Stop website.
The movement of goods is not restricted.
Quarantine requirements
From 00:00 7 September 2020, British nationals resident in the UK will need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, taken no earlier than 72 hours before their arrival, in order to enter Lithuania. This is in addition to the requirement to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival.
British nationals traveling to Lithuania from a country where the incidence of COVID-19 has exceeded 16 cases per 100,000 of population in the last 14 days must self-isolate for 14 days.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Lithuania. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Lithuania guide and contact the Lithuanian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Lithuanian, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Lithuanian and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Lithuanian. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Lithuanian Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Lithuanian before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Lithuanian Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Lithuanian, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Lithuania.
