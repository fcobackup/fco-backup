Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

Don’t get involved with drugs of any kind. Although Denmark is generally a liberal society, drug use is illegal and laws are enforced. You will not be treated more leniently than residents. Drug dealers can receive heavy sentences. Anyone found in possession of illegal drugs deemed to be for personal consumption will often receive a police fine or a short prison sentence.
As of 1 August 2018, it’s illegal in Denmark to wear in a public place any clothing which conceals the face. There are exemptions allowed in Danish law, when concealing your face serves a “worthy purpose”, e.g. for health reasons. Failure to comply with this law is punishable by a fine of DKK1000 (around €135). The fine can increase for repeat offenders. The law applies to both residents and visitors.
Homosexuality is legal and Danish law allows same sex marriages.
Whale meat is available in The Faroe Islands but importing it into the UK/EU is illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Any importation of whale meat to the UK/EU will result in seizure of the goods, possibly a fine of up to £5,000 and a custodial sentence.
