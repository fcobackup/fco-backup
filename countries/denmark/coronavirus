Entry and borders
The Danish border will be closed to foreign nationals who do not have a ‘worthy purpose’ for entering Denmark until further notice. Border checks will be implemented at all entry points. Tourists and those the Danish authorities say cannot demonstrate a ‘worthy purpose’ will not be allowed to cross the border.
Foreign nationals normally living (temporary or permanent residents) and working in Denmark are still able to enter the country, as are those who need to transit through Denmark to return to their place of residence, and those who are providing a service or delivering goods to Denmark. Proof will be required to demonstrate a ‘worthy purpose’ to enter. The Danish authorities have set up a helpline (+45 7020 6044) to provide advice on the conditions of entry for foreign nationals. They have also published an online Q&A which includes clarification on the definition of a ‘worthy purpose’.
The Danish government announced on 17 March that everyone entering Denmark should stay at home for 14 days.
Local measures
Until at least further notice, no more than ten people are allowed to gather either outside or inside (public transport, supermarkets, airport and work places exempt). Public gatherings of more than five hundred people are not permitted until at least 31 August.
From 11 May shops and shopping centres will re-open. From 18 May restaurants, cafes and bars will re-open. Supermarkets and pharmacies remain open.
