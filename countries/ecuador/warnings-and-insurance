State of Emergency declared
On 8 January 2024, the President declared a 60-day state of emergency (SOE) across Ecuador following various security incidents and an increase in criminal activity.
The Ecuadorean Ministry of Tourism is no longer advising tourists to remain in their accommodation. There is a daily curfew from 11pm to 5am which you should observe. Exceptions to the curfew include passengers travelling to/from airports who will need to show their passports or ID and their relevant boarding pass or flight booking. For all airports, only passengers will be allowed to enter the airport, family members and friends will not be allowed into the terminals to drop off or pick up passengers. You may wish to leave extra time to travel to the airport, as extra security checks may be carried out on arrival. Check road conditions (in Spanish).
All airports are currently open but some airlines have cancelled flights. Please check your flight status with your airline or airport website (Quito Airport, Guayaquil Airport) before proceeding to the airport.
You may see increased military and police presence around key public buildings, airports, bus terminals and on the streets. Some public buildings, shopping centres and key tourist destinations may close without warning. You should monitor local media and stay away from areas involving increased security activity.
If an incident occurs near you, follow the instructions of police and other security officials at all times.
