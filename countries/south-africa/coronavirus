International travel
In response to a new variant of COVID-19 in South Africa, from 9am on 24 December direct flights from South Africa have been suspended. Visitors arriving into the UK who have been in or transited through South Africa in the previous 10 days will not be permitted entry. British and Irish citizens, and third country nationals with residence rights in the UK, will still be able to enter via indirect routes from South Africa. You will be required to complete a passenger locator form and must self-isolate for ten days after your arrival, along with your household. If you only hold a visit visa for travel to the UK, you will not be able to enter if you have been in South Africa in the past 10 days.
Until the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 those with residence rights includes: holders of Indefinite Leave to Remain; holders of existing leave to enter or remain (i.e those with biometric Residence permits) or an entry clearance/visa that grants such leave e.g. students, workers, etc (but excluding visit visas); those entering the UK under the EEA Regulations with a view to obtaining rights under the Withdrawal Agreements; holders of EU Settlement Scheme (“EUSS”) leave; EEA children (unless in the case of a child where the decision is in their best interests); family members of EEA nationals with rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.
From 1 January onwards those with residence rights includes: holders of Indefinite Leave to Remain; holders of existing leave to enter or remain (i.e those with biometric Residence permits) or an entry clearance/visa that grants such leave e.g. students, workers, etc (excluding visit visas); holders of EU Settlement Scheme (“EUSS”) leave; those who have rights of entry under the Withdrawal Agreements (including returning residents with a right of residence under the EEA Regulations and EEA frontier workers); family members of EEA nationals with rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.
In response to the new variant, some third countries, including major transit destinations, have also cancelled flights to and from South Africa. If you have a ticket to South Africa booked, you should check with your airline before travelling.
Strict health protocols are in place for international travellers to South Africa. You will need to show a paper copy of a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) COVID-19 test to border officials upon arrival in South Africa. The test must have taken place no more than 72 hours before your departure. It should be conducted by a certified medical practitioner, and should have the name and signature of the practitioner who conducted the test. You should carry several paper copies of your test, as you may need to present it more than once during your journey. If you do not present proof of a test upon arrival, you may be required to enter a government quarantine facility at your own cost. You will need to complete and produce an online travel health questionnaire on your personal device before arriving in South Africa. The questionnaire is available from the South Africa Department of Health See Entry requirements.

Travel in South Africa
Some internal flights are operating.
You must wear a mask if using public transport, which is operating with strict hygiene requirements and reduced passenger numbers.
Children aged 24 months or younger are not required to wear a face mask. However, regulations state that children aged two to five years should be ‘encouraged’ to wear a face mask while in public.
Failure to comply with South African government regulations could result in a fine or arrest.
Accommodation
Hotels, guest houses and private rental accommodation are allowed to open, with protective measures in place. Upon arrival at your accommodation, you will normally be subjected to a temperature test and asked to declare that you do not have coronavirus symptoms. Some accommodation providers will request your travel history. You should contact your accommodation provider for more information.
Public spaces and services
The South African authorities have published COVID-19 guidelines and advice and have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. Failure to comply could result in a fine or arrest.
South Africa has introduced a risk-based, five-level approach to lockdown restrictions. Level three restrictions are in place across the country, with some additional restrictions in areas declared ‘hotspots’.
National restrictions
Level three lockdown restrictions are in place across the country. There is a curfew between 9pm and 6am. You are legally required to wear a face mask when in public and may face a fine or imprisonment for breaking this rule. Sales of alcohol are prohibited and consumption of alcohol in public spaces has been banned. You should ensure you are in your accommodation before the curfew begins. Road blocks are used to enforce curfew in some places. International and interprovincial travel remain permitted subject to COVID-19 precautions.
There are rules limiting the number of people who can gather in groups, and concerning the capacity of public places. More details on these can be found in the regulations published by the South African government.
The government has declared 26 areas as ‘hotspots’, including Cape Town, Johannesburg, the Garden Route, and the Cape Winelands. A full list of hotspots is available here. All beaches, dams, lakes and rivers, including recreational facilities at these places, are closed in ‘hotspot’ areas. Beaches in non-hot spot areas are open from 9am to 7pm and are subject to strict health protocols.
You should comply with any regulations set out by the South African government. See details on regulations and guidance.
Healthcare in South Africa
If you take regular medication, make sure you can access a repeat prescription if you need to. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require a ‘script’ in South Africa (‘script’ is the widely used term in South Africa for ‘prescription’). If you need a prescription in advance, you can visit a local doctor. The doctor might prescribe on the basis of your visit, or they may ask you to obtain an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner in the UK to allow them to write a script. Pharmacies are readily available, with larger pharmacy groups Dis-Chem and Clicks having stores across the country. Some (but not all) of these stores have medical practitioners on site who can write prescriptions.
Private hospitals in South Africa are prepared to treat COVID-19, and the standard of care may be higher than in government hospitals.
For contact details for English speaking doctors, visit our list of doctors.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your health insurer for advice. You can also call the South African government local emergency hotline (0800029 999) or consult the online advice.
