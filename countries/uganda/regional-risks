Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Uganda.

This section has safety advice for regions of Uganda. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Uganda-DRC border
Western Uganda
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
Queen Elizabeth National Park
the area immediately south-west of Kasese town – from the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) at Kyabikere extending eastwards up to and including the A109 road and southwards to Queen Elizabeth National Park
Semuliki National Park
The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a militant group with links to Daesh, may target tourists and foreign nationals near the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). There have been several terrorist attacks in western Uganda, especially around the Bwera border crossing. See Terrorism.
Uganda and the DRC conduct joint military action against the ADF near parts of the Ugandan border, in North Kivu and Ituri provinces of eastern DRC. Ugandan troops are present on both sides of the border as part of the operations.
Border crossing points could close at short notice.
There is also a risk of banditry near the Uganda-DRC border.
FCDO advises against all travel to the DRC provinces that border Uganda. See DRC travel advice.
South-west Uganda
The provinces of DRC bordering south-west Uganda have a history of instability and violent conflict and this can flare up with little notice. FCDO advises against all travel to these DRC provinces. There is a potential for some spillover into Uganda. Take care when travelling in the area.
There are periodic clashes between DRC government forces and armed groups in the DRC close to the Ugandan border. The M23 armed group controls the Bunagana and the Kitagoma-Buszana border crossings in Kisoro district on the DRC side of the border. If you are in this area, keep your security situation under constant review.
Border crossing points have been temporarily suspended in the past following clashes, and could be closed again at short notice.
National parks near DRC and Rwanda
Use reputable, registered tour operators and contact the Ugandan Wildlife Authority (UWA) for up-to-date advice and information before you travel. Mgahinga Gorilla National Park and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park are in the extreme south-west of Uganda near the borders with DRC and Rwanda. It’s routine practice for security personnel to accompany tourists on gorilla-tracking visits in this area.
Some gorilla trekking operators cross into DRC. Avoid taking these tours. FCDO advises against all travel to the provinces of DRC that border Uganda, including Virunga National Park.
Uganda-South Sudan border
Be extra cautious near the Uganda-South Sudan border. FCDO advises against all travel to South Sudan. See South Sudan travel advice.
North-east Uganda
There is an increased security presence in north-east Uganda in the Karamoja sub-region (districts of Kaabong, Kotido, Abim, Moroto and Nakapiripirit) due to cattle theft. Military and civilians have been killed during security operations.
Armed raids to steal cattle and robberies related to cattle trading, some resulting in killings, have been reported in Karamoja. There have also been robberies that have resulted in multiple killings in districts that neighbour Karamoja in the Teso and Acholi sub-regions. The attackers do not usually target foreign nationals, but you should always:
stay alert
be cautious
avoid travel at night
Parts of the north-east are likely to experience flooding during the rainy seasons, from March to May and October to November. Monitor local media and only use suitably equipped 4-wheel-drive vehicles.
Eastern Uganda
Travel to eastern Uganda is largely trouble-free, but during heavy rains there is a risk of landslides, particularly in Bulucheke sub-county in Bududa District near Mount Elgon National Park, a popular tourist destination.
