Before you travel, check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 999 or 911 and ask for an ambulance.
For emergencies at sea dial 767 to contact the Virgin Islands Search and Rescue (VISAR).
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Emergency medical assistance
As the British Virgin Islands (BVI) is a British Overseas Territory, there is no formal British diplomatic or consular representation. The local authorities deal with all requests for emergency assistance.
For medical assistance, contact:
Dr. D. Orlando Smith Hospital
Vaccinations
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check:
the latest information on health risks and what vaccinations you need for the BVI on TravelHealthPro
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Health risks
Health risks in the BVI include:
Zika virus
risks from biting insects and ticks
dengue
See the ‘Other risks’ section of the TravelHealthPro BVI guide for more details.
Hospitals
There is only one hospital in the BVI (Dr. D. Orlando Smith Hospital) and medical facilities are limited. Complex medical problems are frequently referred to hospitals in the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, or mainland USA.
The US visa waiver scheme does not apply to one-off charter flights. Special arrangements must be made for any non-US visa holder who is medically evacuated by charter flight. Make sure you have travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
TravelHealthPro explains best practice when travelling with medicines.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
