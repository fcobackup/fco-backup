Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Eritrea.

This section has safety advice for regions of Eritrea. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Eritrea-Djibouti border
FCDO advises against all travel to within 25km of Eritrea’s border with Djibouti.  
All border crossings between Djibouti and Eritrea are currently closed. In 2008 there was fighting between Djibouti and Eritrea after an incursion of Eritrean forces into the disputed Djibouti border region. Though relations have improved, the situation remains unresolved.
Eritrea-Ethiopia border
FCDO advises against all travel to within 25km of Eritrea’s border with Ethiopia because of military activity on both sides of the border.
All border crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea are currently closed.
Landmines
There is a risk of landmines in the Eritrea-Ethiopia border area. If you are in the border area against FCDO advice, do not leave the main paved highways by car or on foot.
Eritrea-Sudan border
FCDO advises against all travel to within 25km of Eritrea’s border with Sudan because of military activity on both sides of the border. There are ongoing reports of banditry in and around the border area.
The border with Sudan is operational in response to the Sudanese conflict. 
Hanish Islands
It is highly unlikely that Eritrean authorities will issue permits for any vessels to visit the south-western Hanish Islands. These islands are very close to the conflict in Yemen. In the past 3 years, the authorities have detained mariners who landed without a permit.
