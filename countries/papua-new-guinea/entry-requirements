Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Papua New Guinea
Commercial options for travel to and from Papua New Guinea remain very limited. If transiting through another country, it is important that you also check the latest requirements for transit through that country.
Nobody may enter Papua New Guinea unless they have written exemption from the National Pandemic Controller or his delegate, and evidence of a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test result for COVID-19 taken within a 72 hour period prior to boarding at their first port of departure for Papua New Guinea. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
International visitors should apply for their exemption to enter Papua New Guinea by emailing the National Control Centre Travel Desk at covid19-travel@police.gov.pg with the following documents:
completed International Air Passenger Travel Form (I-APTF)
letter to the National Pandemic Controller, including your reason for travel, visa details, passport details (including the expiry date) and, if applicable, your work permit details (or letter from your employer) and/or resident permit details
copy of your passport biodata page
copy of your visa for Papua New Guinea and, if applicable, a copy of your work permit and/or resident permit
copy of your reservation at a designated hotel for quarantine or home quarantine request (as applicable)
proof of vaccination (if applicable)
You should submit your completed documents at least two weeks prior to travel. Approvals will not be granted for the purpose of holidaying or similar activity.
You will need to show evidence of your vaccination (if applicable), approved exemptions, negative COVID-19 test and hotel reservation (if applicable) to be allowed to board a flight to Papua New Guinea. (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’). You must also complete an online electronic health declaration form prior to departure. The barcode generated should be saved and provided at check-in as evidence of submission of the online form.
Unless home quarantine has been authorised, anyone arriving in Papua New Guinea must self-isolate – at their own expense - in a government approved hotel: 7 days for fully vaccinated arrivals and 14 days for partially vaccinated arrivals. Papua New Guinea citizens and permanent residents who are unvaccinated are to be quarantined for 21 days. Any foreign national who is not a permanent resident and who is unvaccinated will not be allowed entry into Papua New Guinea. COVID-19 tests are required on day 1, 5 or 6 for fully vaccinated people; day 1, 7 and 12 or 13 for partially vaccinated people and day 1, 7, 12 and 19 or 20 for unvaccinated people. All arrivals will also be subject to monitoring through either an approved tracking device or tracking application at their own cost. Full details are available on the official Papua New Guinea Government COVID-19 website.
Face masks must be worn on all domestic flights. All domestic travellers must submit a health declaration form to the Provincial Health Authority on arrival. No unvaccinated traveller may travel domestically by air unless they have a valid reason to do so. Domestic airline travellers may need to be tested for COVID-19. Testing requirements for domestic travel are at the discretion of each province, and travellers should check the latest requirements with their travel agent. Full details are available on the official Papua New Guinea Government COVID-19 website. Separate arrangements apply for travel to the Autonomous Region of Bougainville
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Papua New Guinea has not yet confirmed that it will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. You should confirm this directly with your airline. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination.
