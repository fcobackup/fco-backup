Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Finland. The Finnish authorities have declared a state of emergency and introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
Finnish borders will be closed initially between 19 March and 13 April to all non-resident foreign nationals entering the country, with some limited local exemptions. British residents should display an ID card or other proof of residence when arriving in Finland.
Non-resident British nationals are permitted to enter Finland for limited essential or compassionate reasons with evidence for their travel. See the Finnish Border Guard website for more information. Passengers are allowed to transit through Helsinki Airport as long as they can verify acceptance at their final destination.
