Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Qatar
Qatar’s Ministry of Public Health has published advice on how to limit the spread of coronavirus, and has introduced a number of precautionary restrictions on travel and events in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Public transport, including the metro and bus services, operates with a restricted 50% capacity from 9 July 2021. You should wear a mask at all times when using these services. No more than four people are allowed in a vehicle, if they are not part of the same family. The authorities may also stop vehicles to enquire about the reason for the journey.
It is mandatory to wear a face mask whenever you are outside your home, unless you are alone whilst driving a vehicle or exercising. From 22 May 2020, it is also compulsory to have Qatar’s contact tracing app, Ehteraz, downloaded and working on your smartphone whenever you leave the house. The authorities are deploying mobile patrols and setting up checkpoints to prevent social gatherings and check compliance with other measures.
Anyone violating these could incur a fine of up to QR200,000 and/or a prison sentence not exceeding three years.
Accommodation
Hotels are open, and facilities (ie gyms, pool) have reopened subject to restrictions on capacity. Some hotels are being used as quarantine locations.
Public places and services
With effect from 9 July 2021 restrictions on the number of people at gatherings have eased. Indoors, a maximum of 15 vaccinated people, or 5 unvaccinated people or mixed groups, can gather. Outdoors, a maximum of 30 vaccinated people, or 10 unvaccinated people or mixed groups, can gather. Capacity restrictions also apply in restaurants, malls and outdoor swimming pools. You will be asked to show your vaccinated status on the Ehteraz app. If you are unvaccinated entry may be denied. Playgrounds and exercise equipment in public spaces have been reopened, operating on a restricted capacity basis. Mosques and hairdressers also have restrictions on capacity. Entry may be dependent on presenting evidence of being fully vaccinated.
Schools continue to operate a blended approach to education – a mix of in person lessons and on line learning. For further details you should contact the school direct.
Healthcare in Qatar
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
If you have symptoms of coronavirus, you should contact the Ministry of Public Health’s helpline on 16000.
If you are confirmed to have coronavirus, you will be placed in isolation in one of the country’s medical facilities, or asked to self-isolate at home for 14 days, depending on your symptoms.
Emergency medical treatment is excellent but can be expensive. Routine treatment is available but expensive for visitors. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

The Qatari national vaccination programme started in January 2021 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. British nationals resident in Qatar are eligible for vaccination.

Registration for the vaccine can be done through this portal at the Ministry of Public Health.
