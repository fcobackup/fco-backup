If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test which is consistent with the published guidelines.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Bulgaria
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Bulgaria announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Bulgarian national vaccination programme started in January 2021 and is using the AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech and Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) vaccines. British nationals resident in Bulgaria are eligible for vaccination. There are two parts to the Bulgarian rollout programme:
the National Vaccination Plan, which is proceeding to vaccinate the population according to priority groups; and
the Mass Vaccination Scheme “green corridor”, which operates intermittently, as supplies allow.
UK nationals resident in Bulgaria will be offered a vaccination against COVID-19 at the same time as Bulgarian citizens under the provisions of the National Vaccination Plan. They can also put themselves forward as part of the “green corridor” scheme that allows hospitals and clinics to vaccinate all those who wish to come forward, regardless of age or priority grouping. Mobile vaccination buses are also being deployed in a number of areas around the country for ease of access under the ‘green corridor’ scheme.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Health has recommended the administration of a booster dose to the following risk groups of the population:
immunocompromised persons:
persons in care homes
medical staff with a high risk of infection
persons over 65 years of age
persons who have not developed sufficient immunity one month after the completion of the vaccination.
Booster jabs are available through the Bulgarian public health system and can be administered to all citizens at their discretion, not only the above-mentioned risk groups, at least 6 months after the completion of the vaccination, and for persons who have not developed sufficient immunity – one month after the completion of the vaccination.
Details of these and official information on the Bulgarian vaccination programme is available on Bulgaria’s coronavirus website (in Bulgarian).
Bulgarian Health authorities have announced that the AstraZeneca vaccine will not be administered to women under the age of 60 who are at risk of thrombosis, at the discretion of their GPs. Those who have received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine will be able to either receive a second dose of the same vaccine or receive a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, but not earlier than 84 days after the first shot. Those who have received a first dose, but in the meantime became infected with the coronavirus, can receive the second dose no earlier than 6 months after the laboratory confirmation the diagnosis. Those who have recovered from coronavirus, can be vaccinated no earlier than 3 months after the laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis.
On 18 May 2021, Bulgaria’s Health Ministry outlined the procedure to fix inaccuracies in COVID-19 vaccination certificates. Citizens who find discrepancies in their issued certificates (wrong name, date of vaccination, identification number, address, etc.) must send a formal request to the vaccination centre where they received the jab or to the relevant Regional Health Inspectorate, for the region where the vaccination centre is located. The request can be freely worded and should contain the vaccine recipient’s full name, contact details, information about the vaccines administered, as well as a detailed description of the error. If necessary, copies of relevant documentation can be attached. See here for a full list of the Regional Health Inspectorates and their contact details. In cases where the names in the vaccination certificate are misspelled, the errors can also be reported directly to the Ministry of Health by sending an email to mhcallcenter@mh.government.bg with an attached copy of the vaccination certificate and the correct spelling of the names.
On 3 June 2021, Bulgaria approved the use of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 12-15 year olds, which are available through the ‘green corridor’ scheme. If you are considering a vaccination for somebody in this age group, you should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider.
Bulgaria’s Health Ministry has approved the EU Digital COVID certificate. From 4 June 2021, all citizens who have already received their certificate will be able to download the document in the new European format on the National Health Information System website without the need to present an electronic signature. In order to obtain the certificate, citizens need to enter their personal identification number, ID card number and the reference number of one of the two vaccines they received. The vaccine reference numbers can be found in the lower left corner on the existing certificates. Foreign citizens will have to fill in their personal number and the number of their permanent residence document, respectively.
Citizens who haven’t received their certificate yet, can obtain it either through the National Health Information System with an electronic signature, at the vaccination centre where they received their jabs, or through their GP. The document can also be saved as a PDF file, which allows it to be printed later or stored on a mobile device.
The process for correcting any errors on the EU compliant versions is still though the Regional Health Inspectorates as detailed above. There is an agreed six week grace period where older versions can be used within the EU, but it is advised that travellers check the current travel advice for their chosen destination before arriving.
Residence can be demonstrated by using either your Bulgarian residence permit or passport along with another form of documentation showing that you are legally resident in Bulgaria, such as a tenancy agreement, S1 social security document or similar.
National Vaccination Plan
To participate in the national vaccination plan, you should make sure that you are registered with a GP/family doctor and ensure that they are aware that you wish to be vaccinated. The family doctor can let you know when the vaccine will be provided under the relevant phase.
Mass Vaccination Scheme (‘green corridor’)
The ‘green corridor’ scheme is designed to facilitate mass vaccination when vaccine supply permits. To participate, check the list of all participating medical establishments.
If you would like to participate in the scheme, visit Bulgaria’s coronavirus website to register. Currently, the platform is available only in Bulgarian. The registration process requires users enter their personal identification data, to select their preferred vaccine, vaccination centre and time slot. Permanent and long-term residents in Bulgaria can use their ‘personal number of a foreign national’ (ЛНЧ – личен номер на чужденец) in order to register.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad. If you’re a British national living in Bulgaria, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
