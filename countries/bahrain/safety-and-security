Security situation
Demonstrations and protests can take place occasionally. This may include attempts to disrupt traffic, disturbances in villages and near economic centres. These occasionally result in localised clashes between government security forces and protesters. Anniversaries of significant events in Bahrain sometimes carry an increased risk of protests, which can start with little warning. Locations where such incidents have taken place in the past include Sitra, Bani Jamra, Karbabad, Saar, Karzakan, the Budaiya Highway and surrounding villages.
You should remain vigilant, follow the advice of the local authorities and be aware of your surroundings wherever you are on the island.
Violent protests pose a risk to those who might inadvertently find themselves near to an active demonstration.
If you encounter a large public gathering or demonstration, leave the area immediately. If you see any suspect item, don’t approach or touch it. Move away and call the police on 999 or the Police Hotline 8000 8008.
Travel on the main routes during daylight hours is generally orderly. There are some police checkpoints.
During demonstrations, roads can become blocked, resulting in diversions. These may re-route you to areas with which you are unfamiliar. You should familiarise yourself with alternative routes.
Developments in the wider region continue to have an impact on local public opinion. You should be aware of local sensitivities on these issues. Follow news reports and be alert to local and regional developments, which may trigger public disturbances.
The Ministry of Interior has issued a reminder that all residents and visitors must carry photographic ID. Under Bahraini law, it’s an offence not to be able to present photographic ID if asked to do so by a member of the Bahraini authorities, and you may be subject to a fine of up to 300BHD.
Crime
Around 4,000 British nationals live in Bahrain, and thousands more visit each year. Most visits are trouble free. Crime is generally uncommon in most areas, but nevertheless visitors should take due care and attention, including using reputable taxi companies.
Road travel
You can drive in Bahrain with a valid UK driving licence for up to 3 months. If you’re staying longer, you will need to get either a local licence or an International Driving Permit (IDP). If you are using an IDP, please ensure that you visit the Traffic Authority upon arrival to have it certified.
As of 28 March 2019, the IDP you will need in Bahrain is a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP). 1926 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use in Bahrain after this date. From 1 February 2019, you can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Bahrain operates a zero tolerance policy to drink-driving. If you are caught you will be arrested and put in the drivers’ prison. Your case will not be heard until the next working day. First time offenders will have to pay a minimum £900 fine and could be banned from driving in Bahrain. Visitors from Saudi Arabia will be subject to the same punishment but with the addition of a driving ban there also. For repeat offenders the fine and ban will be more serious.
Air travel
Bahrain International Airport is modern and efficient.
Although alcohol is available at Bahrain airport, security officers and airline staff deal firmly with passengers believed to be drunk - even those who are in transit through the airport. In such circumstance you may be denied boarding, detained and fined.
Sea travel
There is a Government of Bahrain imposed curfew on the waterways around Bahrain between 6.30pm and 4am. You should respect the curfew.
Take care when travelling by Dhow. The safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available.
Many sea areas of the Gulf are considered highly sensitive by local authorities. Vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected, and there have been occasional arrests. Make careful enquiries before entering these waters or visiting ports.
Regional tensions may affect your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of maritime attack.
