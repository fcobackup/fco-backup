Political situation
Belarus is governed by a strong Presidential system with the police and security services loyal to it. The authorities show little tolerance for their opposition counterparts. You should maintain a high level of security awareness, particularly in public places and avoid demonstrations.
Belarusian authorities launched a violent crackdown against demonstrators across Belarus following Presidential elections on 9 August 2020. Further demonstrations and protests are possible and are likely to become confrontational, with security forces using force to disperse and detain demonstrators. You are advised to remain vigilant, avoid crowds, and if protests do break out, you should leave the area immediately. British media representatives should make sure they are clearly identifiable.
Polish border situation
Due to the recently increased migratory pressure, the FCDO advises against all but essential travel to areas close to the Polish border, specifically around the Bruzgi-Kuzniсa crossing. The crossing is now closed to vehicles and more border checkpoints may close or implement restrictions at short notice. There are increased restrictions on movement and activities in the border areas. If you are near the border you should remain cautious and avoid large crowds or gatherings.
Crime
There is little crime in Belarus but, you should be alert at all times to the possibility of mugging, pickpocketing and theft from vehicles or hotel rooms. Take extra care when travelling by train; there have been instances of theft from travellers, especially on sleeper trains to Warsaw and Moscow.
Road travel
Licences and documents
You need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in Belarus. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use in Belarus after this date. You can get IPD’s over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
A green card is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad. You need to carry a green card to drive in Belarus.
At the border
There may be long queues at borders. Customs and immigration can be lengthy and bureaucratic. You should ignore any private facilitators who offer to help you pass through checkpoints and border crossings.
You must be able to produce ownership documents or a letter of ‘power of attorney’ at border crossings. Only originals of these documents are accepted. You must have third party car insurance or you may get an on-the-spot fine. You can only buy this when entering Belarus. Ask at Customs’ border offices for further information.
Don’t overstay the temporary import terms for your vehicle. Violation of the exit deadline may result in confiscation of your vehicle at the Belarusian border or if stopped at an in-country police checkpoint.
Driving regulations
Drivers with foreign licence plates must pay a fee to use toll roads, via an electronic toll collection system. Information can be found on the BelToll website. The website includes toll road maps and guidance on registration, purchase of the required on-board unit, and payment. There are fines for non-compliance, so follow the installation instructions carefully to make sure your vehicle is successfully identified at checkpoints.
Buses may require permits for picking up passengers in Belarus, or for transiting. These permits are free. Find out when a permit is required and how to get one.
You should observe the speed limit at all times. The standard speed limit is 60 km/h (37 mph) in built up areas; 90 km/h (55 mph) outside built up areas; and up to 120 km/h (74 mph) on motorways (Brest-Moscow). Visiting motorists who have held a driving licence for under 2 years must not exceed 70 km/h (43 mph).
There is a zero-tolerance policy towards drink driving.
There are police checkpoints on routes throughout the country. You should stop when instructed and have vehicle documentation to hand. You should only make official payments.
Driving standards
The quality of driving in Belarus is unpredictable. A-class highways are in good condition. The condition of B-class roads varies considerably and some are impassable for periods in winter. Road works and potholes are usually poorly marked. Horse and carriage combinations are a specific hazard for drivers in rural unlit areas.
See the AA and RAC guides on driving in Belarus.
Air travel
On 23 May 2021 a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius was diverted while in Belarusian airspace following a reported security alert on board. The aircraft was escorted into Minsk International Airport by the Belarusian Air Force. After a number of hours on the ground in Minsk, the aircraft was allowed to leave and continue to Vilnius.
On 24 May 2021 the UK government issued an advisory notice to strongly advise all UK airlines to cease overflights of Belarusian airspace. The operating permit of the Belarusian airline Belavia to fly between the UK and Belarus has been suspended. This means there will no longer be any direct flights from Belarus to the UK. All Belarusian airlines have been banned from entering UK airspace without prior authorisation. On 25 May the European Union agreed to ban the overflight of EU airspace by Belarusian airlines. The Ukrainian Government has also banned overflight of its airspace by Belarusian airlines. We understand many flights departing Belarus have recently been cancelled and a number of international carriers have cancelled their Minsk bound flights. You are advised to check with your carrier on the status of any flights you have booked.
People wishing to travel from Belarus to the UK will now have to exit Belarus by the land border and fly via neighbouring countries, or take an indirect air route via a country that has not imposed a ban. If you have tickets booked with Belavia you should contact the airline directly to arrange a refund. British nationals who entered Belarus by air under 30-day visa free provisions and who wish to leave Belarus across a land border will need to apply for an exit visa. Applications should be made to the local Citizenship and Migration office.
If you plan to depart Belarus by air using one of the routes still operating you should check FCDO Travel Advice for the country you are travelling to or transiting through. You are also advised to check the requirements for entering the UK.
There are no internal flights currently available in Belarus.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation has carried out an audit of the implementation level of critical elements of safety oversight in Belarus.
