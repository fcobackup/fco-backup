Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for mainland Portugal, Madeira and the Azores on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Portugal, any pre-departure test you may need has to be booked in advance and paid for in full. You will not need a prescription, but you will have to show your passport and confirmed travel bookings. It can take up to 24 hours for the results to be returned. You can schedule a test at any private clinic. Find one near you from this list of approved facilities.
If you are staying in the Algarve, find a clinic near you on the Algarve tourist authority’s website.
If you are travelling to Madeira or Porto Santo, schedule a COVID-19 test at one of the facilities approved by the Madeira Health authority.
If you are travelling to the Azores, book your return COVID-19 test at a clinic on the island where you are staying. Ask your hotel or local tourist office for help in finding a clinic closest to you.

If you need a pre-departure test for the country you are transiting through, you can get one in Portugal by scheduling an appointment at an approved facility. You will not need a prescription, but you will have to show your passport and confirmed travel bookings. You will also have to pay in full. It can take up to 24 hours to get the results.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 in Portugal, you will have to self-isolate. The public health authorities will give you guidance on when you can stop self-isolating. In these circumstances, make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
If you need medical advice while you are in isolation, you should contact one of the helplines listed in the section below on Healthcare in Portugal or 112 in an emergency.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Portugal
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Portuguese government announces any new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Portuguese national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) vaccines. British nationals resident in Portugal who have a permanent or temporary healthcare user’s number are eligible for vaccination.
If you live in mainland Portugal and you have not yet had a COVID-19 vaccination, you can take a digital ticket and arrange to be vaccinated now at a vaccination centre near you. If you do not have a healthcare user’s number, apply for a temporary one using this form or ask your health centre to register you for healthcare. You will need a Portuguese mobile number for this purpose.
COVID-19 Boosters
The Portuguese authorities have initiated their booster programme. Keep up-to-date with the programme on the health authority’s website. When you go for your booster, take your passport or other form of identification, your healthcare user’s number and/or your COVID vaccination card.
The Portuguese authorities are also vaccinating children aged between 5 and 11. Check the health authority’s website for further information.
If you live in Madeira, and have not yet had a COVID-19 vaccination or COVID-19 booster, call the health authorities on 800 210 263 or send an email to vacinacao@sesaram.pt to book an appointment now. Alternatively, go to your health centre on vaccination days and ask whether you can have the vaccination without an appointment. If you live in the Azores and you have not yet been vaccinated, use this form to register for the vaccine.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Portugal, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you have received your COVID-19 vaccination in Portugal, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the health authorities. Remember to download or print your certificate again after you have had the booster vaccine. For further information, visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
