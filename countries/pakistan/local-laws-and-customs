You should dress modestly at all times. Men and women should cover their shoulders and legs when in public. Women should cover their heads when entering mosques or other holy places, and when travelling in rural areas.
Homosexuality is illegal. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.

The death penalty can and has been imposed for crimes including blasphemy, murder, drug offences, rape and unlawful assembly.
