The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British nationals do not need visas to visit Guyana. Visitors are generally given 30 days to remain in Guyana, but extensions can usually be obtained from the Ministry of Home Affairs in Georgetown. The Guyanese authorities are very severe on visitors who overstay or abuse the conditions of their stay. Conviction for overstaying will result in one year imprisonment, a fine of up to G$50,000 (Guyana dollars) and deportation - at the deportee’s expense - upon release.
Check entry requirements with the Guyana High Commission in London before you travel.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Guyana.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into Guyana.
Departure tax
All passengers leaving Guyana must pay a compulsory departure tax/security levy. The current fee is G$4,000/£13/US$20 and must be paid in cash (Guyana dollars or US dollars).
