Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Antigua and Barbuda. The authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The Antigua and Barbuda Emergency Medical Service are asking the public to call the COVID-19 inquiries hotline on 462 6843 if they suspect they might have contracted the virus, been exposed to or any other matters relating to the virus. The public are asked to call the hotline and not visit a healthcare facility unless instructed to.
On 12 March the government of Antigua and Barbuda announced that with immediate effect, until further notice, any non-Antiguan and Barbudan national with a travel history in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, France and Germany within 28 days will not be permitted entry into Antigua and Barbuda. Travellers arriving from Montserrat are being screened, which may result in extended travel time.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
