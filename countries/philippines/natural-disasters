Typhoons
Around 20 typhoons hit the Philippines each year. Most typhoons occur from June to November. There may be flooding and landslides.
You should monitor the progress of approaching storms on the websites of the Philippines state weather agency, the Philippines Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council and typhoon.com, or follow  @Typhoon2k on Twitter.
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you’re caught up in a storm.
Earthquakes
The Philippines is in an earthquake zone. There were around 30 earthquakes between May 2016 and May 2017. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency. You can find more information about earthquakes on the Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) website.
Volcanoes
There are numerous volcanoes in the Philippines, any of which can erupt without warning. Sudden steam and ash explosions may occur at any time. Mt Kanlaon, Negros Island erupted in December 2015. Check news reports and follow local advice before travelling to volcanic areas. Avoid volcanic areas during and immediately after heavy rainfall when there’s increased risk of lava flows. You can find more information about volcanoes on the Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) website.
The capacity of the Philippine emergency and rescue services to deal with large natural disasters is limited.
The eruptive activity of the Mayon volcano in Albay Province (Bicol region) has reduced since 2018, although it remains at a moderate level of unrest with a risk of sudden eruptions, lava collapses and ash fall. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) has lowered the alert to level 2 but an exclusion zone remains in place. If you’re in Albay Province, you should follow the advice of the local authorities, including the advice not to enter the designated danger zone. You should remain vigilant and follow developments on the PHIVOLCS website.
Ash plumes can affect air quality and have an impact on health. A properly fitted face mask may provide some protection. If you have any pre-existing respiratory conditions, you might be at increased risk of triggering or worsening your symptoms. Additional advice on the potential health hazards can found on the International Volcanic Health Hazard Network website.
