The Honduran authorities request that people keep up to date with the latest restrictions by visiting the following official page where all important information about COVID-19 as well as all advice from the Honduran authorities can be found. See Health.
Entry to Honduras
Airports in Honduras are now open for domestic and international travel. You must follow the social distancing rules and wear a mask at all times while at the airport.
Prior to arrival, you are required to pre-register online with Honduran Immigration. You must present a negative COVID-19 test result upon arrival from a test taken in the previous 72 hours.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the Honduran immigration authorities or the nearest Honduran Embassy/Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Testing/screening on arrival
You should comply with any additional screening or testing measures put in place by the authorities.
Quarantine requirements
If you are eligible for entry, you should self-isolate for 14 days after arrival. Local authorities will provide further instructions about the place where you should complete the quarantine.
Data collection
Upon arrival in Honduras, you will be asked to complete an immigration form where you will be required to provide the address where you will be staying. Local authorities will provide further instructions on any other details you should provide upon arrival.
Testing on departure
There is currently no testing upon departure in Honduras. They will take your temperature upon arrival at the airport.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals do not need a visa to visit Honduras. You can get a 30 day visit entry stamp on arrival. If you wish to extend this you can do so up to a maximum of 90 days by applying at an Immigration Office.
If you overstay you should expect to pay a fine at the Immigration Office when you apply to extend your stay or before departure. For information on which office to go to and how to follow this process contact the National Institute of Migration (Facebook).
For more information on entry requirements for other purposes, like voluntary work, contact the Honduran Embassy in London hondurasuk@lineone.net.
Children travelling with only one parent or without both parents or legal guardians must present a notarised letter of consent from the non-travelling parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to enter and exit Honduras. Contact the nearest Embassy or Consulate of Honduras, or if you’re in Honduras the nearest National Institute of Migration (Facebook), for information about the process and language requirements for consent documents.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Honduras.
Central America Border Control Agreement
Honduras is party to the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4). Under the terms of this agreement, British tourists can travel within any of the CA-4 countries (Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala) for a period of up to 90 days without completing entry and exit formalities at border immigration checkpoints. This period begins at the first point of entry of any of the CA-4 countries. Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90-day limit, although a request for an extension can be made for up to 30 days by paying a fee before the 90 day limit expires. If you are expelled from any of the four countries you are also excluded from the entire CA-4 region.
If you are planning on travelling to Nicaragua, prior to your trip you should check information on entry requirements with your travel company, the Nicaraguan Immigration authorities or by contacting your nearest Nicaraguan embassy. You should also check our travel advice for Nicaragua.
Land borders
If you arrive or depart at a land border, the immigration authorities may charge you a fee of US$3 at the border crossing. Keep the receipt until you leave the country and make sure your passport is stamped.
Due to the movement of migrant caravans, you should take extra care at the walking border crossings with Guatemala. On 1 October, a caravan of approximately 3000 migrants from Honduras, forced their way through Frontera de Corinto (in Izabal) border crossing between Honduras and Guatemala.

There is a US$48.44 (or Lempira equivalent) airport departure tax which should be included in the price of the ticket (if not, be prepared to pay this in cash or with a credit card). There is also an airport departure tax for domestic flights of 54.13 Lempiras (or the equivalent in US dollars). For more information, check the Honduras Airports website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
