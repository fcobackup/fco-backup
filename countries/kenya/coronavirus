International travel
The Government of Kenya has announced that, from 11 January 2021, all persons departing Kenya will be required to have a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test and an associated Trusted Travel code, which airlines and Port Health authorities will verify at the airport. After visiting an authorised laboratory to undertake an RT PCR COVID-19 test, travellers will receive a text message from PanaBIOS and an email from the laboratory itself and/or admin@panabios.org with a link to generate a Travel Code at trustedtravel.panabios.org. If the test result meets Kenya’s exit requirements, a Travel Code will be issued to the traveller.
All Kenyan RT PCR COVID-19 testing laboratories are party to the Trusted Travel system.
Commercial flights are operating to and from Kenya. Check with your travel company for the latest information.
The Kenya-Uganda, Kenya-Somalia and Kenya-Tanzania borders re-opened on 1 August.

Renewal of visas
The Kenyan Immigration Department has lifted a COVID-19-related amnesty on visitors who have overstayed their stipulated visiting period.

Travel in Kenya
The nationwide curfew has been extended to 12 March 2021. The curfew is in effect from 10pm to 4am (local time). During curfew hours, everyone must stay at home or indoors, except for essential service workers.
The Government of Kenya has advised that passengers departing the airport during curfew must retain their boarding pass as proof of their arrival time, which will allow for movement to their accommodation. Similarly, evidence of air passengers arriving during curfew will enable access for drivers coming to collect passengers during curfew hours.
You do not need a COVID-19 negative test to board domestic flights within Kenya.
The Government of Kenya has directed that, in addition to public transport systems, social distancing rules – in the form of capacity restrictions – will also apply when using private vehicles, including taxis. This means five-seater vehicles will only be allowed to carry two passengers in addition to the driver, while seven-seater vehicles will only be allowed four passengers in addition to the driver.
Public places and services
The Government of Kenya has directed that face masks must be worn in public places, except when dining, or when adhering to social distancing in hotels, gardens or on beaches.
Public places, tourism and hospitality establishments, travel and tour companies, hotels and other accommodations, restaurants, eateries, food and beverage outlets and entertainment and recreation facilities are allowed to operate, provided they comply with Government of Kenya public health protocols, including 1.5 metre social distancing and the night-time curfew. Bars reopened on 29 September.
On 4 November, the Government of Kenya directed that eateries and restaurants will close at 9pm (local time), but will be permitted to sell alcohol.
The suspension of large gatherings, meetings, conferences and political events was extended for an additional sixty days on 3 January 2021. The maximum number of persons permitted to attend funerals and weddings has been capped at 150, with all in attendance expected to abide by Ministry of Health protocols.
Kenyan citizens have been advised to avoid crowded places and to work remotely where possible.
Healthcare in Kenya
The Government of Kenya has indicated that anyone testing positive for COVID-19, but presenting as asymptomatic or with only mild symptoms, can expect to be directed to self-isolate at home if able to do so. Vulnerable persons will be prioritised for hospital care. Ministry of Health guidance is available.
Pharmacies and other shops selling essential products remain open, though business hours may be affected by the nationwide curfew.
The authorities are conducting random temperature screenings in spaces frequented by the general public. If you show signs or symptoms of coronavirus and are able to self-isolate, you can expect to be directed to do so. If you cannot self-isolate, you can expect to be taken into a State health facility by the Kenyan authorities.
