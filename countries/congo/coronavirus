Flights
An Air France flight is currently scheduled to depart Brazzaville on 27 July. The flight will travel to Paris (Charles de Gaulle) where passengers can take onward connections to the UK. For details and booking, you should buy tickets from Air France directly:
Air France Pointe Noire Ticket Office (open 9am to 3.30pm):

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM is a commercial partner of the FCO and authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
