Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in China.
You should check local testing facilities information on the National Health Commission website.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes that may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, current Chinese government advice is that you should remain at home if you’re asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Those suffering more severe symptoms should seek medical assistance.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in China
There are no mandatory COVID-19 related requirements or restrictions for domestic travel. Mandatory mask wearing on public transport, including on flights, has now been lifted, although many people still choose to wear face masks on public transport (as per government advice).
Masks remain mandatory when a person has tested positive for COVID-19 or is displaying symptoms, during local outbreaks and in medical institutions and nursing homes.
COVID-19 restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements for travel between different parts of the country have been removed.
If you’re planning to leave China in the near future you should regularly check with your airline for updates.
