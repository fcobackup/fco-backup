The Malagasy Ariary (MGA) is the local currency of Madagascar. The most accepted foreign currency is the Euro, but US dollars and GBP are easily changed. You can exchange money at banks or make withdrawals from local ATMs. If you use a money exchange office, count your money immediately to make sure you haven’t been short changed. There have been a number of reports of this type of fraud in the exchange offices operating in the Antananarivo international airport.
