Burkina Faso has a large Muslim population. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times. You should be aware of your actions so that they do not offend others, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas.
See Travelling during Ramadan.
Do not get involved in drugs of any kind. If you commit a criminal offence you can expect to be subjected to local law. Penalties can be severe. Convicted offenders can expect heavy fines and long jail sentences. Local prison conditions are harsh.
Burkina Faso’s custom authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning export from the country of items like masks, religious materials and antiquities. Exporting art objects is subject to the prior approval of the Ministry of Culture.
Do not photograph military or other government installations. If you’re a tourist, you no longer need to get a photograph permit from the Tourist Office but there remains a list of prohibited buildings/installations for which film crews still need permits. Mobile phone networks can be unreliable especially outside towns and cities.
Homosexuality is illegal. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Carry ID (passport or residence permit) at all times.
