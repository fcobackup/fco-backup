Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Samoa
Samoa’s international borders are currently closed under an ongoing State of Emergency, unless approved by the Samoan government due to exceptional circumstances, e.g. repatriation.
The Samoan Ministry of Health issued updated travel advice on 30 December 2020 which denies entry to travellers originating from or transiting the UK and South Africa. This is due to the emergence of a COVID-19 variant. See the Samoan Health Advisory website for further details, including a list of other countries from where entry will be denied.
The Samoan government announced that, with effect from 26 March 2020, all international travel to and from Samoa by plane will cease until further notice.
All international cruise ships and yachts will not be granted entry into Samoa.
Some countries in the region have also introduced travel restrictions to and from the Pacific islands. You should check specifics for any countries that might be involved in your travel when planning a trip to and/or from Samoa.
In this context, all travellers from outside of New Zealand must spend 28 days in New Zealand before onward travel to Samoa and must comply with all requirements. All passengers entering Samoa from New Zealand will be quarantined for 14 days at a designated facility.
Testing/Screening on arrival
Travellers from New Zealand need: to complete the Health Declaration Card in flight; to have a COVID-19 test within three days before arrival; and to undergo a medical examination by a Registered Medical Practitioner within three days before arrival.
You will not be permitted to board the plane if you have a positive COVID-19 test or a COVID-19 test has not been done. Additionally, you will not be allowed to board if you have any of the following symptoms: cough; fever; sore throat; or flu-like symptoms.
All travellers need to present a hard copy of a COVID-19 test and medical report on arrival to health officers. Failure can result in denial of entry, with individuals returned to the point of departure before Samoa.
Quarantine requirements
You will be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival into Samoa at a designated location. You must bring your own personal necessities, such as soap, tooth brush, toothpaste, to last for the 14 days of quarantine.
Passengers are advised to check in 1 piece of luggage (max 20 kgs) when boarding. If you have any known medical conditions, please ensure you have enough medication to last for 2 months and inform relevant officials on arrival. You’re not allowed to bring alcohol into the quarantine site or allowed to consume any alcohol. Passengers who are on special diets will be responsible to pay for their own special dietary needs. You need to wear a face mask at all times and advised to maintain social distancing in flight.
Whilst in quarantine the cost of accommodation, breakfast and lunch for passengers should be borne by the Samoan government, but dinner will be the passenger’s responsibility. All children and infants less than 18 years must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Parents must ensure all immunisations are up to date. Parents/legal guardians travelling with children must ensure sufficient supplies of basic needs while in quarantine, such as diapers, wipes, formula. A family member must travel with passengers having chronic medical conditions, the elderly and those with special needs. There are penalties if the conditions of the quarantine are breached.
Travel via Australia or New Zealand
The government of Australia has announced that from 9pm Australia Eastern Standard Time on 20 March 2020, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March 2020.
