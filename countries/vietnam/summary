The Vietnamese Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has confirmed that further testing at the scene of a fire at a light bulb factory in Hanoi’s Thanh Xuân district on 28 August has discovered levels of mercury significantly in excess of World Health Organization recommended limits. Vietnamese authorities have advised residents living within 500 metres of the factory to take precautionary sanitary measures, including cleaning the home and avoiding using food or water from that area which has been open to the environment. If you’re visiting or living in an affected area, you should follow the advice of the local authorities. If you have reason to believe that you may have inhaled or ingested mercury or are experiencing physical symptoms, seek medical advice.
