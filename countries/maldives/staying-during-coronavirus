Moving around in Maldives
A Public Health Emergency is in place until 29 June.
The curfew in the Greater Male’ area which includes Male’, Vilimale’ and Hulhumale’ has been extended for 14 days, effective from 12 June to 26 June. Entry and exit from the Greater Male’ area is also banned for the duration of this curfew. Under new restrictions, effective from 15 June, no permits are required for movement within the Greater Male’ area from 0500 to 2130 (local time), after which movement is restricted to authorised personnel only.
There are no travel restrictions between islands without Covid-19 cases. Travel to and from islands with confirmed Covid-19 cases are restricted. Public and mass gatherings have been banned, including parties, ceremonies, picnics, swimming, group sports, social events and gatherings of any size at people’s homes. Social distancing measures have been put in place and no gatherings of more than three people are allowed in any public space.
Travel from and to resorts from all inhabited islands is suspended. All excursion activities (such as day trips to picnic islands, fishing and dolphin watching) from all islands, resorts, safaris and guesthouses are now banned across the country until further notice.
Public spaces such as parks or sports grounds are open with hand hygiene measures and washing stations in place.
Accommodation
Guest houses and city hotels on all islands across Maldives are currently banned from accepting any new bookings. This ban does not affect guests currently checked-in to any facilities.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Maldives, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
