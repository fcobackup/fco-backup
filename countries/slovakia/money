Only exchange money in banks and certified exchange offices. You can find these in all major hotels and some department stores. Travellers’ cheques aren’t generally accepted in stores, small hotels or restaurants. You can’t exchange Scottish or Northern Irish bank notes.
ATM machines accept UK bank or credit cards (Cirrus, Maestro or Visa) are common. Shops - particularly in the main tourist areas - increasingly accept credit cards, but are sometimes reluctant to accept cards issued by foreign banks. Check first that the shop will accept your card and that it can be read (there are sometimes problems with “Maestro”). Check your statements carefully when you get home.
