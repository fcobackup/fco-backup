This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Sri Lanka set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
All visitors are advised to apply online for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) to enter Sri Lanka. Visitors can apply for an ETA on the ETA website. Further information on eligibility is available on the Department of Immigration and Emigration website.
On arrival visa facilities are available, however applying for an ETA before travel is advised for ease of travel and to prevent delays on arrival.
All visitors need to comply with the guidelines imposed for tourists by the Government of Sri Lanka.
If your visa is expiring you will need to apply for an extension through the Department for Immigration and Emigration. You should ring the Department for Immigration and Emigration on +94 70 710 1050 or visit their website to make an appointment.
Entry requirements could change at short notice, and government websites are not always up to date. You should follow the instructions of the local authorities.

Proof of vaccination status
Sri Lanka will only accept the UK’s printed version of proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.

Unvaccinated travellers aged 12 and above entering Sri Lanka, will need to show proof of either a negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours before embarkation), or a negative Rapid Antigen Test report (taken within 48 hours before embarkation). Self-swab tests will not be recognised. See information on getting a test before entry. (Children under the age of 12 are exempt.)
