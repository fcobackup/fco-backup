This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Mauritius’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Mauritius set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Mauritius High Commission in the UK.   
Passport validity requirements 
Your passport must:  
be valid for the duration of your stay 
have one blank page 
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Visa requirements 
You can visit Mauritius without a visa for up to 60 days. When you arrive, a border official will stamp your passport to show the end-date for your permitted stay.  
You must be able to show proof of onward or return travel.  
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Mauritian government’s entry requirements. 
Digital travel form 
You must fill in the Mauritius All in One travel form online before you arrive. Print out a copy of your completed form with a QR code on it. You’ll need to show the form to officials when you arrive at the airport. If you do not fill in the form before you arrive, you’ll be asked to fill in an immigration disembarkation card at the airport.  
Vaccine requirements 
For details about health entry requirements and recommended vaccinations see TravelHealthPro’s Mauritius guide.  
Travelling from Reunion Island to Mauritius
On arrival in Mauritius, you may be asked further questions about your health and recent travel history, although plans to ask people to show a PCR test for Chikungunya have been postponed.
Health screening
If you travel to Mauritius from a country where malaria is common, border officials may ask you for a blood sample to meet Ministry of Health requirements. If you are not tested at the airport, officials may contact you later during your visit. 
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Mauritius. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
