If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with any UK government testing requirements. Test providers can be found on the Visit Jamaica website.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will need to self-isolate until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment in Jamaica.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Jamaica
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Jamaica announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Jamaican national vaccination programme started in April 2021 and is predominantly using the AstraZeneca vaccine, although other vaccines may be available in limited supply. The Jamaican authorities have confirmed that they have and will continue, to offer vaccines to foreign residents who fall into the eligible categories, as and when these are applied to Jamaican citizens. Further information on the vaccination programme is available on the Government of Jamaica’s Ministry of Health and Wellness website.
