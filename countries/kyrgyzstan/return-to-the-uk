There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Kyrgyzstan. There are no commercial flights scheduled and all land borders are closed. Turkish Airlines have now suspended their earlier draft plans to resume commercial flights between Bishkek and Istanbul from 22 June, as the Kyrgyz government have not granted permission for international flights to resume.
A number of Turkish Aviation companies are, however, considering running a series of repatriation flights from Bishkek to Istanbul for Turkish passengers. If relevant permissions are granted for the flights and there are spaces available tickets may be opened up to other foreign nationals wishing to return to Europe. The exact dates of travel and costs have not yet been decided. If you want to register your interest in these flights, contact Consular.Bishkek@fco.gov.uk and provide us with:
A copy of the information page from your passport
Your contact e-mail address, phone number and WhatsApp Number
Your consent for us to share this information with relevant Airlines, the Turkish Embassy in the Kyrgyz Republic, and Kyrgyz authorities.
These flights are not yet confirmed and registering your interest is not a commitment to travel, or to buying a ticket, neither does it guarantee you will be able to get a ticket on these flights. For the moment the relevant airlines want to assess the level of interest to establish whether a flight might be possible. If flights do go ahead you will need to make your own arrangements for onward travel from Istanbul.
We know the lack of commercial flights is concerning for British people trying to leave Kyrgyzstan. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Kyrgyz authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Whilst you cannot leave Kyrgyzstan at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options become available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM is a commercial partner of the FCO and authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK

are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
