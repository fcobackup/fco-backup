Travel in Hungary
Budapest Airport is open, but travel disruption and short notice flight cancellations are possible.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Hungary to limit the spread of COVID-19.
There is a nationwide curfew in force between midnight and 5am, except for people working or commuting to and from work. You should generally not be outside your place of residence during these hours.
It is mandatory to wear a face mask on public transport and taxis, in shops, in bars and restaurants (except when eating or drinking), at sports events, in cinemas, theatres, concert halls, health and social care institutions, and public offices. Compliance with the rules is monitored and violators can face a fine.
Sporting events, cinemas and theatres must restrict attendance using only every third seat in the venue.
New restrictions on events that have recorded or live music mean that many will no longer be able to go ahead. Some venues, like nightclubs, will close. Venues with seating, like bars and restaurants, will be able to stay open for seated customers. Indoor events with over 500 attendees are currently banned.
Visitors to hospitals and social care facilities are banned. As of 1 October, only teachers and students will be allowed into school buildings and will be required to undergo temperature screening upon entry.
Parking nationwide is currently free of charge, to reduce crowds on public transport.
Local authorities have some powers to introduce additional restrictions, so follow local instructions.
