The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Non-resident foreign nationals may enter Paraguay subject to compliance with health protocols.
Foreign travellers must complete an online health declaration available on the Paraguayan Health Ministry website. All travellers must complete the health card at the time of entering the country at the immigration check informing the Paraguayan Ministry of Health of any potential issues or exposure.
Non-resident foreigners must present international medical insurance with complete health coverage to include attention to COVID-19 cases, PCR tests, laboratory studies, outpatient care, hospitalisation, and stays in the ICU. Children under 18 years old that have a mother or father with Paraguayan nationality are exempt from this requirement.
Travellers over the age of 10 years that arrive with a negative PCR test result issued 72 hours before departure will not require isolation, however those without a test result should isolate for 14 days. Travellers under 10 years need not enter with a test.
All people entering the country must comply with the sanitary measures imposed by the Ministry of Health, such as physical distancing, use of facemasks and frequent hand washing.
Visas
From 2 November, tourists and non-resident foreigners who are still within Paraguayan national territory and whose period of lawful stay in the country has expired, must pay the corresponding penalty (Gs. 253,050) when registering their departure at the border post or airport immigration control or when approaching the offices of the Direccion General de Migraciones.
Likewise, foreign citizens whose temporary residence has expired must approach the Direccion General de Migraciones to obtain a new residence card, pay the corresponding penalty in case of being in breach and update their immigration status.
If you are in Paraguay and your period of lawful stay has expired, contact the Direccion General de Migraciones for further information.
You can find more information on the Paraguayan Dirección General de Migraciones website (in Spanish).
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Passport holders do not need a visa to enter Paraguay. On presentation of a valid British passport you will normally be granted a 90-day stay in the country.
You must make sure on arrival that your passport is stamped by an immigration official, dated and signed. Anybody without an entry stamp in their passport will be fined when they leave the country. This is particularly important for anyone entering Paraguay at a land border, typically the crossing between Ciudad del Este and Foz de Iguazu (Brazil). Sometimes long distance bus drivers tell foreign nationals that they can complete immigration formalities in Asunción. This is not true, and visitors will incur a fine if they do not get their passport stamped at the point of entry.
If you wish to extend your stay for another 90-day period, seek advice from the Direccion General de Migraciones.
If you are travelling to Paraguay to work or study you should contact the Paraguayan Embassy in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Travelling with children
If you’re under 18, travelling across borders in the region without one or both parents, it’s advisable to have written permission to travel from both parents, duly certified by the Paraguayan Embassy in London, or your nearest Paraguayan Embassy. Single parents or other adults travelling alone with children should be aware that immigration officers often request documentary evidence of parental responsibility before allowing lone parents to enter the country or, in some cases, before permitting the children to leave the country. For more information on this contact the Paraguayan Embassy in London.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Paraguay. The validity requirements are the same as for full validity British passports. If you plan to travel to Argentina or the US you will need a visa in your ETD. You must contact the nearest Embassies of those countries in order to apply.
Be aware that the British Embassy in Asunción does not produce ETDs. In case you require an ETD it will be done so through the British Embassy in Buenos Aires.
