Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in South Africa
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in South Africa.
The main threat is from individuals who may have been inspired by terrorist groups, including Daesh, may carry out ‘lone actor’ attacks. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners such as shopping areas in major cities.
Kidnap
Terrorist kidnap is a risk in South Africa.
British government policy is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. Paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can increase the risk of hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.
Political situation
There are regular protests and demonstrations that can turn violent.  Violence could affect participants and bystanders. This can happen anywhere in South Africa at short notice.
Avoid areas where protests, demonstrations, or marches are taking place, especially in city centres and townships. Do not cross protester roadblocks. This could provoke a violent reaction. Monitor local and social media for updates, including local radio.
There are currently ongoing strikes in the Cape Town area.  These have the potential to turn violent and may impact multiple areas including journeys to and from the airport. Please check for any disruption on your route before travelling, avoid violent protests and try to stick to major routes.  Where safer to do so, consider delaying your journey and, if possible, seek advice from a trusted local source, such as your hotel or travel provider.  You can find up to date information from Cape Town Airport’s twitter feed and the City of Cape Town feed
Crime
Violent crime
There is a high crime rate, including carjacking, house robbery, rape, sexual assault and murder. Violent crime can take place anywhere, including in tourist destinations and transport hubs.  Most violent crimes occur in townships on the outskirts of major cities or in isolated areas. The threat is higher in central business districts of major cities than in suburban areas, and increases after dark.
The risk of violent crime to visitors in the main tourist cities is generally low. There is usually additional security personnel in the main tourist areas who can assist tourists. However, policing and security can be limited, so always remain vigilant.
To protect your personal safety:
do not have valuables on show
do not leave valuables in your car
take safe and reliable transport see Public Transport
stay alert and be wary of people who approach you
do not walk around after dark
travel with friends and make sure someone knows your plans
if you visit a township, only go with a responsible and reliable tour guide.
For more information on crime statistics, see the Statistics South Africa website.
Fraud and scams
Be alert to the risk of scams, including through business or employment opportunities, visa facilitation or offers of romance and friendships.
Card skimming and confidence scams are widespread. There has been an increase in cybercrime and internet scamming. Do not meet up with or send money to someone you do not know.
Crime around ATMs is common. You should:
hide your PIN when withdrawing money or paying by card
be aware of fraudsters, such as strangers offering to “help” when your card doesn’t work, or who try to lure you to an ATM
change large sums of money in banks or secure shopping malls, not in busy public areas
If you use a visa agent, be wary of fraud. Always follow the correct visa application process through the Department of Home Affairs.
Criminals often use the details of British High Commissions and embassies to carry out their fraud. These scams come in many forms and can pose great financial loss for the victims. Be cautious and check the authenticity of details before responding.
Criminals may pose as officials for financial or personal gain. If in doubt, ask to see their ID and move into a safe, public and open space. All police officers must carry their Appointment Certificate on them. If you have any concerns, call:
police on 10111
emergency services on 112
Criminal kidnaps
The threat of kidnap throughout South Africa is increasing. Kidnaps are generally for financial gain or motivated by criminality. In recent years, several foreign nationals, including British nationals, have been kidnapped. There have been reports of young children being kidnapped from shops, shopping malls and beaches.
British nationals can be seen as wealthier than locals and may be at particular risk of kidnap for financial gain.
Safety in airports
Crime can happen in and around the airport, including robbery and theft of baggage and valuables. People have been followed from OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg to their destinations and then robbed, often at gunpoint.
You should:
be careful in and around the airport
use main roads and highways when driving to and from airports
go through public areas quickly
avoid isolated areas
consider being met on arrival by your hotel or tour operator
go to your connecting flight quickly if travelling through
consider vacuum-wrapping luggage if local regulations allow
keep valuables in your carry-on luggage and look after it
Vehicle hijacking and robbery
Vehicle hijacking and robbery are common, particularly after dark and around traffic lights, junctions, petrol stations and driveways. It is common for thieves to break car windows and take valuable while cars are waiting at a junction.
Criminals sometimes force a vehicle to stop so they can rob those inside. Common tactics include throwing spikes (sometimes hidden in plastic bags), stones or glass in front of the vehicle. If you are targeted, drive as far as possible, or to a place of safety, before you stop.
Criminals may pose as police and use ‘blue lights’ on plain (often white) vehicles to stop motorists and steal the vehicle. If you are suspicious, do not stop and continue to a police station, petrol station or other place of safety to call the police.
Don’t pick up strangers or stop to help apparently distressed motorists. Continue driving and report the incident to the police. If you are involved in a hijacking, stay calm and surrender your valuables and your vehicle if asked. Do not resist.
There have been reports of long queues leading to armed robberies and express kidnappings close to the Lembombo border at Nelspruit, Mpumalanga. These often take place after dark. Consider whether you can use a different crossing or only approach the border during daylight hours.
To reduce your risk:
use a GPS and check your route for any hazards before you set off
keep to main roads and park in well-lit areas
always take care and be aware of your surroundings
avoid being stationary inside your vehicle for long periods
check your car is locked when you leave it
keep your windows closed, especially when stopped at junctions
keep valuables out of sight, ideally kept in the boot of the vehicle
ask your hire car company for a vehicle with ‘smash and grab’ film installed on the windows
stop at junctions or in queues ensuring you can see the tarmac and the tyres of the car in front of you, giving you space to escape if you need to
Power cuts
There are ongoing nationwide power shortages with rolling power cuts. Scheduled regular power outages (‘loadshedding’) have become longer and can occur daily power cuts affect:
private accommodation
shops
banks and ATMs
public lighting
traffic lights
security systems
petrol stations
water and communication services
There may be higher risk of crime where security systems or public lighting do not work.
Planning for power cuts
To check how it might affect you, you can:
ask your accommodation provider how they mitigate loadshedding
check planned power outages on the Eskom website or ‘loadshedding’ apps
follow the advice of local authorities if water restrictions, including avoiding drinking tap water, are in place
Preparing for power cuts
Prepare for long power cuts by:
writing down emergency contact numbers and carry a notepad and pen
having an emergency plan so you can let relatives and friends know where you are
carrying a power bank with extra charging cables for electronic devices you need
carrying portable lighting, for example a torch
taking enough medicine and first aid supplies
finding safe areas close by in case you need help, such as hotels, hospitals and police stations that may have power
reading our advice for if you are affected by a crisis
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
Always carry a copy of your passport photo page and the page with your visitors permit or residence permit for South Africa. South African officials may request identification and proof of residence at any time. Keep your passport itself in a hotel safe or another secure location and do not carry it with you, unless needed for official identification.
Legal and illegal drugs
It is illegal to buy or sell cannabis or to use it in public. Using cannabis for consumption in private is legal. Public and private use of cannabidiol oils (CBD oils) is also legal.
The use, sale and purchase of all other drugs is illegal.
LGBT travellers
Homosexuality is legal, and it is illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation. See our advice for LGBT travellers.
Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs
It is illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade any of its parts without a permit. Trading ivory or rhino horn is banned. Anyone caught buying or trafficking banned goods will be prosecuted.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Kruger National Park
After a violent attack that killed a tourist, South Africa National Parks (SANParks) advise against using the Numbi gate entrance to Kruger National Park. There have been protests and violent incidents on the R538 road leading to the gate.
Follow SANParks advice on using alternative entrances. If you stay outside the park, contact your lodge in advance to find out if any disruptions will affect your trip. Get up-to-date SANParks news on the park website.
Swimming safety
Beach conditions and local safety measures vary. Every year, many people drown due to strong sea currents.
On beaches where there is no equipment or warning signs, speak to local people who know the conditions. If in doubt, do not enter the water.
On busier tourist beaches, follow warnings displayed and instructions from lifeguards. Learn more about rip currents on the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) website.
In an emergency, call:
112 - emergency services
+27 87 094 9774 - NSRI emergency line
Hiking and walking
When visiting national parks, South African National Parks advise:
hiking in groups of 4 or more
sticking to busy marked trails on popular days (such as weekends)
planning your route
being prepared for bad weather
telling someone when you expect to return
Avoid isolated beaches and picnic spots. Do not walk alone in remote areas or on beaches when deserted or after dark.
Table Mountain National Park
There have been violent attacks on hikers and tourists in Table Mountain National Park. Take care in quieter areas of the park, especially early in the morning or just before the park closes. Some Cape Town residents use social media (Meet up, Facebook) to coordinate hikes in larger groups. See the South African Nationals Parks website for more on hiking on Table Mountain.
Transport risks
Road travel
Uber (e-taxis) and taxis
Uber scams do occur in major cities. Check the vehicle registration and identity before entering the vehicle. Do not wait in the street and keep your phone or valuables out of sight. When inside the vehicle, ask the driver to close rear windows and lock doors if you cannot do so yourself. At airports, be wary of unregulated drivers posing as Uber drivers. If you order an Uber, go to the designated area to wait.
Tension between Uber and metered taxi drivers can lead to armed violence, particularly around Gautrain stations and airports. Uber passengers have been harassed. High-risk areas are generally flagged in the Uber app, but exercise caution when using Uber or metred taxis.
Driving standards and road conditions
Driving standards vary in South Africa. Road accidents resulting in death are common, particularly around major public holidays.
On highways, overtaking or undertaking can occur in any lane including the hard shoulder. On single-lane roads, the hard shoulder is also sometimes used by trucks and slower vehicles to allow faster vehicles to overtake. At most intersections, including 4-way stops and where traffic lights are out of service due to power outages, the first vehicle to arrive generally has priority. On larger roundabouts, you should give way to the right, although this rule is often ignored. Small roundabouts (called circles) are treated the same as a 4-way stop.
Road conditions are mostly very good. Some roads in remote areas are less well maintained and may have potholes. If you are travelling to a lodge in a remote area, check road conditions with the lodge management as a car with good ground clearance may be required. Drive cautiously, obey speed limits and avoid unfamiliar rural areas at night. To avoid running out of fuel, keep fuel levels above half a tank. Learn more about road safety awareness on the Arrive Alive website.
If you rent a car, save the emergency roadside assistance numbers. Download an offline map if you do not have access to a GPS.
Driving licences in South Africa
You can drive in South Africa with a valid UK photocard driving licence for up to 12 months. If you have a paper licence, you should also get an international driving permit (IDP) before you travel.
If you become a permanent resident, exchange your UK licence for a local licence within 12 months of getting your residency. See our Living in South Africa guide for more information.
Public transport
These transport options are generally safe and reliable:
‘Gautrain’ train between Johannesburg, Pretoria and ORTambo International Airport. Do not walk to or from Gautrain stations after dark.
MyCiTi bus in Cape Town (central business district and Atlantic Seaboard). Do not travel into townships by MyCiTi bus. There have been violent attacks reported in Khayelitsha.
airport shuttle buses through internationally recognised hotels.
internationally recognised e-hailing apps if bookings confirmed through the app
Some transport services can be unreliable and passengers have been subject to theft and violence. These include:
minibus taxis
Metrorail train services
long-distance public train and coach services
Borders
South Africa shares a border with Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Botswana. Be careful when crossing land borders and avoid crossing at night. Border queues can be a target for crime. Protests can happen at some border crossings, particularly at the Mozambique border.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Flooding
Heavy rainfall can lead to widespread flooding. Always check local weather reports and local news for any hazards before you start your journey.
