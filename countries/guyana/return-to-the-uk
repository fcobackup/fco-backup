There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Guyana.
The Government of Guyana has announced the cancellation of all international flights from Cheddi Jagan International Airport at Timehri and the Eugene Correia Airport at Ogle. The closure started on 17 March 2020 and is scheduled to last for the foreseeable future.
The flight which departed on 7 May will be the only UK organised special flight from Guyana.
KLM has announced a flight from Paramaribo, Suriname to Amsterdam on 6 June 2020. Subject to clearances from the Governments of Suriname and Guyana, there will be a private charter flight from the Eugene F. Correia Airport at Ogle to Paramaribo in order to connect with this KLM flight. There will only be limited seats available.
Due to the urgent need for travellers to book on KLM, seats on the charter flight from Guyana will be on a first come, first served basis. If you wish to take this flight you will need to book onward flights with KLM. You are also responsible for making arrangements to get from Amsterdam to the UK. Email returnfrom.guyana@fco.gov.uk if you wish to be considered for passage on the aircraft from Guyana to Suriname. This is a private charter and therefore the British High Commission does not accept responsibility for delays or cancellations.
The Governments of Brazil and Suriname have both announced the closure of borders with neighbouring countries, including Guyana. There is no exit/entry available to Venezuela.
