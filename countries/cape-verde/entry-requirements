The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
There are no regular commercial flights flying to and from Cape Verde. See International Travel.
TAP Air Portugal are operating a limited number of flights between Lisbon and Santiago and São Vicente islands for essential travel only. You’ll not be allowed to enter Cape Verde if you cannot prove your travel is of an essential nature. You’ll need to check the conditions for travel with the airline before you book a flight.
See our travel advice for Portugal on the requirements for entry and transit through Lisbon.
The Cape Verdean authorities have re-opened sea borders and passenger ferries have resumed services (75% maximum capacity). Internal inter-island flights are operational. If you are travelling between islands, you’ll need to complete an online health surveillance form before you travel.
If you are travelling from the islands of São Nicolau, Santiago, Sal and Ilha Do Fogo:
You must have a COVID-19 test in a local municipal health facility or in a certified private laboratory, no later than 72 hours prior to travel
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test
You’ll need to pay 1,000 CV Escudos (around £8-£10) for the test, a health declaration and result certificate
Make sure the fee you pay includes the health declaration and test result.
You can consult Cape Verde legislation on testing requirements online (in Portuguese only).
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.

If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Cape Verdean embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
From 1 January 2019, if you have a British Citizen passport you can enter Cape Verde as a visitor for stays of up to 30 days without a visa.
In place of a visa, before travelling you should register with the Cape Verde authorities on the EASE website and, if arriving by air, pay a new Airport Security Tax (TSA) of 3,400 escudos (approximately £30). This does not apply to visitors under 2 years of age or those who are normally resident in Cape Verde. Check with your tour operator or airline what arrangements are in place for your booking, as some tour operators and airlines may complete this on your behalf and have specific registration requirements. You can find more information on the pre-registration process and TSA in this information leaflet.
