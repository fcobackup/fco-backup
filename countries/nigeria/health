Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Medication
Pharmacies are widely available in Nigeria. They will accept prescriptions from the UK.
Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in Nigeria. If you need a new prescription, a doctor in Nigeria can issue one for a fee. Take your existing packaging to show them exactly what you need.

Healthcare in Nigeria
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Nigeria. 
Medical standards differ from the UK and you will have to pay for any medical treatment at public hospitals. Private hospitals are more expensive. Local hospitals may be crowded and there can be shortages in medical supplies and equipment.
