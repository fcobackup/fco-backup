All travellers
Travel ban on foreign nationals
Taiwan has in place a temporary ban on foreign nationals entering Taiwan. However there are certain exceptions, as follows.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has announced that, from 13 April 2022, foreign relatives of Taiwan citizens and foreign residents in Taiwan, with the exception of migrant workers, are now able to apply for a special entry permit to enter Taiwan. Applicants will be required to complete an online visa application form and to submit the required documentation to the Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA) for consideration.
In addition, exceptions apply for the following groups: ARC/APRC/Gold Card holders, business travellers, foreign spouses of Taiwan passport holders and their children under the age of 20, foreign relatives of Taiwan passport holders, international students and foreign professors and researchers.
All foreign nationals will be required to have obtained the correct entry permissions and a visa before they arrive in Taiwan. Currently there is no set date for when these border measures will be lifted. Exceptions may be made for emergency or humanitarian reasons. You should contact your local Taipei Representative Office for further information. Anyone entering Taiwan will be required to follow the quarantine requirements set out below.
All passengers travelling to Taiwan will be required to follow the quarantine and testing requirements set out below.
Screening on arrival
All passengers arriving in Taiwan are required to present a certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken within two calendar days of boarding their flight to Taiwan. The test will be calculated based on the “specimen collection date” not the test report date. Any exemption due to exceptional circumstances will require prior approval before departure.
Test Certificates of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR must be issued by a recognised medical institution in the country of departure and include the following information:
the passenger’s full name as per their passport,
the date of birth or passport number of the traveller,
specimen collection date and test report date,
the virus name, testing method and the test result
Test Certificates are required to be produced in either English or Chinese; however, in situations where the passenger provides a certificate in either French or Spanish, if the certificate is in the official language of the place of departure, and ground personnel of the airline are able to assist with the inspection of the content, the certificate may be accepted.
All passengers arriving in Taiwan will be required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test using a saliva sample upon arrival before being permitted to proceed to their pre-arranged quarantine facility. If the COVID-19 PCR test comes back positive, passengers undergoing quarantine at their residential property will be notified and permitted to undergo home care at the same location during their quarantine period. Passengers who test positive and are quarantining at a designated quarantine hotel will be notified and transferred to an enhanced epidemic prevention hotel, designated quarantine centre or hospital for further treatment. The decision regarding these arrangements will be made by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and will depend on the severity of your symptoms.
From 15 June 2022, all passengers arriving in Taiwan from overseas will now be able to choose between taking a quarantine taxi or having a friend or relative pick them up from the airport and take them to their pre-arranged quarantine accommodation.
Anyone found to provide false or incorrect test results, or evade or obstruct the quarantine measures, may face a fine of between NT$10,000 to NT$150,000 and further criminal charges.
Refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control for further information regarding Test Exemptions, Test Certificates and COVID-19 test requirements.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Quarantine requirements for passengers arriving in Taiwan
The Central Epidemic Command Centre has announced that starting from 15 June 2022, the mandatory quarantine period for international arrivals in Taiwan will be reduced from 7 to 3 days, followed by a 4 day self-initiated epidemic prevention period (previously called self-health management). There is currently a maximum ceiling set of 25,000 arrivals permitted per week into Taiwan.
You will be required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test using a saliva sample upon arrival at the airport and a further self-administered rapid COVID-19 test will be required on the last day of your mandatory quarantine. You should submit the result of your rapid COVID-19 test to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) using the instructions provided. The local authorities will cover the costs of the COVID-19 PCR test and the self-administered rapid COVID-19 test.
Passengers who are eligible and choose to complete their mandatory quarantine at their residential property rather than a quarantine hotel or a designated quarantine facility will be required to declare that their residence complies with quarantine requirements.
You should refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) or contact their helpline on 1922 for further information.

Visa extensions
The Taiwanese authorities announced in March that travellers already in Taiwan who arrived under a visa waiver, visitor visa or landing visa before 21 March 2020, and had not overstayed their entry conditions, would be granted an automatic 30-day extension of their stay. This has now been extended by further 30 day periods. The extension will be applied automatically, no application is required. Your total period of stay, including extensions, cannot exceed 900 days (comprised of 180 days on a visitor visa, plus 24 automatic 30 day extensions). For more information, you should contact the National Immigration Agency (NIA).
If you arrived after 21 March 2020, your maximum stay is determined by your visa. If you wish to stay over 180 days, you may apply to do so if you have a legitimate reason for needing to remain in Taiwan or are unable to leave. Restrictions apply and not all British nationals will be eligible. You cannot apply more than 15 days before the 180 day point. For more information, you should contact the National Immigration Agency (NIA). The British Office is unable to issue letters or endorsements to support any application to remain.
From 10 March 2022, in line with existing arrangements in the UK, UK nationals in Taiwan who hold a Youth Mobility Scheme (YMS) visa will be able to apply to switch in Taiwan to a working visa or a visa to study a degree course at undergraduate level or higher.
All applications should be submitted to the Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA) for consideration. You will then be able to apply for an Alien Resident Card at your local National Immigration Agency (NIA) Service Center once your application has been approved.
