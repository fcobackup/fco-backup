This page has information on travelling to France.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in France set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how France’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for France before travel.
From 1 August 2022, COVID-19 travel restrictions for travellers to France were lifted. The rules that previously applied to travellers coming to France no longer apply (with the exception of travel from China):
you are no longer required to present proof of vaccination
you are no longer required to fill out any forms prior to your arrival in France, such as a justification for travel or a sworn statement
you are no longer required to show proof of a negative PCR or antigen test upon arrival in France
This also applies to travel between metropolitan France and each of the French overseas territories.
Similarly, no travel justification is required by the French authorities to travel to another country from France.
Exceptions may apply and new rules can come into force at short notice. You can check with your travel operator or the relevant French Embassy before travelling. Separate entry requirements are in place for travel to France from China; details of these requirements can be found on the French Government website.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for France are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
Further information
Check our COVID-19 advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for France are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
Children and young people
There are no specific requirements for children and young people.
If you’re transiting through France
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Transiting through France is permitted for travellers from the UK in line with the entry requirements set out above.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must be:
Issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.
Contact the embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area, which France is part of, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training. Find more information here.
If you are travelling to France and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the French government’s entry requirements. To see what your individual entry requirement might be, you should visit the France Visas website.
You can input your specific requirements and you will be advised whether you need a visa; it is also the site for visa applications.
If you are travelling to France for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in France with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
British citizens who are unable to return to the UK before the expiry of their visa / permit or the end of their visa-free limit should contact their local prefecture in France.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through France as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
At French border control, you may need to:
show proof of where you intend to stay, for example, a booking confirmation or proof of address if visiting your own property (e.g. second home). Further information is detailed below
show proof of insurance for your trip. Please check the guidance on travel insurance here
show a return or onward ticket
prove that you have enough money for the duration of your stay. Further information is detailed below
France categorises possible accommodation arrangements for visitors as follows:
Staying with family, friends or third party - you may be asked to provide an ’attestation d’accueil’ (welcome invitation) from your host if you are staying with friends or family. The French resident hosting you will need to obtain this attestation d’accueil from their local Mayor’s office, and send the original attestation before you enter France. You should also be prepared to show proof of funds of at least €32.50 per day, for the duration of your stay. If you do not have an ‘attestation d’accueil’ you should be ready to fulfil the requirements of option 4 below.
You have a second home in France - you will need to be able to prove ownership or tenancy of your property e.g. a tax or utility bill.
You are staying in a hotel or other commercially provided accommodation - you may be asked for confirmation of your reservation when entering France. You should also be prepared to show proof of funds of at least €65 per day for the duration of your stay.
You do not have an ‘attestation d’accueil’ or any pre-booked accommodation - in this instance, you may be asked to prove you have sufficient means for your visit, of at least €120 per day for the duration of your stay.
British citizens who are unable to return to the UK before the expiry of their visa/permit or the end of their visa-free limit due to COVID-19 restrictions should contact their local immigration authorities in France.
For further information on these requirements, visit the French government’s website on travel conditions for British citizens.
If you are resident in France, read our Living in France guide for passport stamping information.
Travelling with children
From 15 January 2017, any child (under the age of 18) who is (a) living in France and (b) leaving France unaccompanied by a parent or guardian, must present the following documents on departure at the French border: (i) the child’s own ID card or passport, (ii) a completed AST authorisation form signed by a parent/guardian (Authorisation de Sortie du Territoire) and (iii) a copy of the ID card or passport of the parent or guardian who has signed the AST form. For more information visit the French Ministry of Interior website.
Travelling with pets
If you wish to travel with a pet dog, cat or ferret to the EU, please read our guidance. You can no longer use a pet passport issued in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) for travel to France. If your pet passport was issued in an EU Member State or Northern Ireland it remains valid for travel to France.
If you wish to travel to France with other pets (for non-commercial means) - rodents, rabbits/hares, ornamental tropical fish, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates (except bees and crustaceans), you will need a health document which must be signed by a vet.
Travel with pets for non-commercial means is limited to five animals.
You can find more information (in French) at this link and by then scrolling down and clicking on the link to a pdf document entitled note d’information sur l’importation d’animaux de compagnie en provenance de pays tiers. The health document mentioned above is on page 17 of the pdf (annex IV).
On arrival in France, pet owners travelling with pets will need to enter through a designated travellers’ point of entry (TPE) e.g. Calais, Dunkirk.
Customs checks upon entry into France
There are limits on the volume and value amounts for certain goods that you can bring into France as a traveller. You should check the French Directorate General of Customs and Excise website to confirm the latest allowances per traveller.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from France.
