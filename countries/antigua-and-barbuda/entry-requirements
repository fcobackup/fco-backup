If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.

Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Testing / screening on arrival
The following measures apply to travellers to Antigua and Barbuda regardless of vaccination status:
All passengers 12 years and older arriving by air in Antigua and Barbuda, including those transiting the country, must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken no more than seven days before arrival. Only tests administered by health care professionals are valid. Home tests are not permitted. Further health screening is in place at VC Bird International Airport and the private jet terminal for all international arrivals. The measures are subject to change but may include mandatory temperature, travel history checks, a check on whether your accommodation is on the Government of Antigua and Barbuda’s Approved List, completion of a Health Declaration Form and further testing for Coronavirus. You should expect long waiting times on arrival.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Passengers arriving by sea must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken no more than seven days before their last point of departure and follow the Government of Antigua and Barbuda’s Yachting Health and Safety Guidance and Operational Protocols. All Marine Pleasure Craft and Ferry Services entering the waters of Antigua and Barbuda should contact the Antigua Port Authority, using VHF Channel 16, at least six (6) hours prior to arrival. Instructions will be given to guide the crafts to either the Nevis Street Pier or English Harbour Ports or to a holding area where they must follow the screening and quarantine instructions of Port Health.
Visitors instructed by the local authorities to take a Coronavirus test on arrival may be asked to pay a fee of US$ 100 in cash.
Quarantine requirements
On arrival, you will be subject to health screening. The Ministry of Health and Wellness of Antigua and Barbuda advise that all arrivals will be monitored for coronavirus for up to 14 days and that ultimately it is the decision of the Quarantine Authority on who must self-isolate or quarantine on arrival.
In practice, tourists arriving with pre-booked hotel accommodation from the Government of Antigua and Barbuda’s Approved List will normally be permitted to travel to their accommodation after screening and be allowed to move around the country providing they adhere to local social distancing measures.
Visitors staying with family, friends, in private accommodation, in their own place of residence, or other location not on the Government of Antigua and Barbuda’s Approved List will be subject to an interview to determine suitability to leave for their accommodation arrangements. Those permitted to self-isolate in their accommodation will have to do so for a period up to 14 days and may be required to wear a quarantine bracelet to ensure compliance.
Regardless of whether they have been vaccinated, residents and visitors not deemed to have suitable accommodation arrangements will be obliged to remain in government quarantine at their expense for the period directed by the Quarantine Authority up to a period of 14 days. The fee is XCD 100 per day.
Failure to comply with any order, guideline or direction of the Quarantine Authority or other health authorities is considered an offence carrying a fine of up to XCD 10,000 and/or six months imprisonment.
Entry to Antigua and Barbuda
All aircrafts must arrive at VC Bird International Airport or the private jet terminal. Only licensed taxis are permitted to pick up or drop off passengers at either the airport or private jet terminal.
All Marine Pleasure Craft and Ferry Services entering the waters of Antigua and Barbuda should contact the Antigua Port Authority, using VHF Channel 16, at least six (6) hours prior to arrival.
