Following measures taken by the authorities in Kosovo, there are no commercial options for returning to the UK directly from Kosovo. The government have announced they will review flight restrictions in early June. You should contact your airline for the latest information on flight status and availability over the coming months, however bear in mind that flights could be cancelled at short notice.
As restrictive measures ease, there may be options to return to the UK from neighbouring countries. Certain land border crossings have re-opened but with some protective measures. You should check FCO travel advice for the relevant country for options and before attempting to cross borders. See Entry requirements.
This travel advice will be updated if direct departure options become available.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
