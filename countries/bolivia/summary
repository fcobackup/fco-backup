The political and security situation remains uncertain across Bolivia following an extended period of wide-scale political demonstrations and civil unrest since disputed elections in October 2019, and the resignation of the President and senior public officials on 10 November.

You should continue to avoid large crowds and public demonstrations, don’t attempt to cross blockades, and pay close attention to developments via local media and this travel advice. If you’re intending to travel within Bolivia, you should plan your travel carefully, regularly check the viability of your plans and be prepared to change them at short notice.
