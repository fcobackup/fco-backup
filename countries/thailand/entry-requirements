This page has information on travelling to Thailand.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Thailand set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Thailand’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
From 1 October, passengers will be no longer required to present COVID-19 related documents such as a certificate of vaccination and COVID-19 test results upon arrival in Thailand.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Thailand are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Thailand are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
Children and young people
There are no specific requirements for children and young people.
If you’re transiting through Thailand
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Check with your airline before departing.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport must have at least 6 months’ validity remaining from your date of entry into Thailand. You may be refused entry to Thailand if your passport is damaged or has pages missing.
If you’re a dual national, you must leave Thailand on the same passport you used to enter. If you don’t, you may experience difficulties as you pass through immigration.
Visas
You need a valid visa to stay in Thailand. If you do not have a valid visa you will have to pay overstay penalties. You should speak to your local Immigration Office or visit the Thai Immigration website.
You are legally required to have a valid passport in Thailand. If your passport expires, your visa will become invalid. If you need to renew or apply for a new British passport, see Overseas British passport applications.
If you cannot renew or change your visa and are not able to travel to the UK (because the border is closed, for example) contact the British Embassy in Bangkok.
If you have queries about visas or entry requirements, check with the Royal Thai Embassy, Thai Immigration Authority and Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Thai authorities may introduce further measures in response to COVID-19. You can monitor the latest updates from Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health website.
From 1 October 2022 to 31 March 2023, British passport holders arriving by air or land can enter Thailand for 45days without a visa (a ‘visa exemption’).
If you plan to stay for more than 45 days or you will work in Thailand, you must get the appropriate visa before you travel. For more information, contact the nearest Thai Embassy or Consulate.
The only legal way to get a new visa, entry permit or extension of stay is from a Thai Embassy or Consulate, an Immigration Officer when you enter Thailand, or one of the Immigration Offices around the country. Visas issued by visa shops, travel agents or by any other means are likely to be illegal and lead to criminal proceedings.
If you stay beyond the period of your visa (‘overstay’), you’ll be fined 500 baht per day up to a maximum of 20,000 baht. You also risk being held in detention, fined, deported at your own expense and banned from re-entering Thailand. The enforcement of penalties for overstaying is strict and conditions in detention centres can be harsh. Deportation by the Thai authorities can be a lengthy process and you will also be banned from re-entering Thailand for up to 10 years.
If you’re living or staying in Thailand on a long-term visa, immigration rules can be complex and are subject to change. It is your responsibility to ensure you meet the requirements of your visa. Stay informed and contact your local immigration office for more information.
If you have any queries about visas or entry requirements, check with the Royal Thai Embassy or Thai Immigration Authority.
Proof of onward travel and funds
Immigration officials in Thailand may ask you for proof of onward travel (eg a return or onward air ticket). You should make all reservations before travelling to Thailand. Some airlines have refused to board passengers without evidence of onward travel.
Immigration officials may also ask for evidence of adequate finances and have refused entry to people who could not show this. This is not defined in law and can be interpreted in a number of ways.
Employment
To work in Thailand you will need a work permit or business visa. Failure to follow this rule can lead to arrest and deportation.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Thailand. The purpose of the visit to Thailand using an ETD and whether approval is granted, is entirely at the discretion of the Thai authorities. They consider applications on a case-by-case basis. If you’re planning to enter Thailand using a UK ETD, you should contact the nearest Thai Embassy or Consulate before you travel to seek advice about whether an ETD will be accepted and if so is a visa required.
