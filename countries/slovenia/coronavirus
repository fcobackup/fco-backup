Public spaces and services
Most services (including retail services) are permitted to re-open, provided that health and safety guidance can be implemented. However there are some exceptions, including nightclubs.
Protective masks (or other material covering the nose and mouth) must be worn in indoor public areas, on public transport and in busy public outdoor spaces such as high streets, where maintaining social distance is not possible.
Restaurants and bars are permitted to open from 6am to 10pm, if they are able to serve customers whilst observing social distancing requirements. You must use the supplied hand sanitiser upon entry.
Public transport (buses and trains) resumed service on 11 May. You are required to wear a protective mask, sanitise your hands with the supplied hand sanitiser and maintain a safety distance of at least 1.5m.
Wherever possible, tickets should be bought in advance (online, ticket machines and at sales counters). Taxi services continue to be available.
Gatherings of up to 50 people are permitted without prior approval from health authorities, where health and safety guidance can be implemented. The organiser of events which are attended by more than 10 people, must keep a record of personal information of participants (full name and address). This information may be requested by the National Institute of Public Health, for monitoring purposes and preventing the spread of coronavirus.
