This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Uzbekistan set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Uzbekistan
From 3 December 2021, air traffic (including transit flights) with South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Madagascar, Lesotho, Eswatini, Tanzania and Hong Kong will be suspended. Also, citizens of the listed states, stateless persons permanently residing in these states, as well as citizens of third countries who have visited these countries in the last 14 days, are prohibited from entering Uzbekistan, although this could change at very short notice.
British nationals arriving from the UK are permitted to enter Uzbekistan. A valid negative PCR test certificate, issued within the last 48 hours, is required for arrival into the country. From 3 December 2021, visitors arriving into Uzbekistan from the UK will be required to self-isolate for 10 days at home or at a hotel, at their own expense. This is currently being reviewed and may change at short notice.
PCR test for entry into Uzbekistan
To enter Uzbekistan you must be able to show a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test for coronavirus taken no more than 48 hours before your arrival into the country. This includes people who are vaccinated, including with boosters.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You must arrange to take a private test.
Testing/Screening on arrival
Individuals entering Uzbekistan will also be subject to a rapid coronavirus infection antigen test at border checkpoints, at your own expense (around US $5).
If you test positive
Foreign visitors arriving by car who test positive at the border will be denied entry. Foreign citizens and stateless persons permanently residing in Uzbekistan will be quarantined in a medical institution located in the relevant territory.
Transiting Uzbekistan
British nationals can transit Uzbekistan airside, if they meet the requirements for the next country they are travelling to.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you have a British citizen passport you can enter Uzbekistan as a visitor for stays of up to 30 days without a visa.
If you’re travelling on a different type of British passport, are travelling for a purpose other than tourism or business, or intending to stay longer than 30 days, you should check entry requirements with the Embassy of the Republic of Uzbekistan in London.
If you’re entering Uzbekistan on an Uzbek visa make sure that you check it once issued and carefully note the date of expiry and the number of entries permitted.
Do not overstay your visa, or exceed your permitted duration of stay, even for a very short period. Any traveller found to have overstayed will face a fine and possibly deportation. It is not always easy or possible to extend your stay or a visa if you wish to remain in the country for longer than you originally intended. If you are travelling overland, make sure you arrive at your intended border crossing in good time before your period of stay or visa expires.
For further information contact the Embassy of the Republic of Uzbekistan in London.
Registration
You must register within 3 days of arrival. Saturdays and Sundays count as part of the three day period. If you are staying in a hotel, you will be asked for your passport at check-in and it will be retained for a short period. Hotel staff will complete the registration paperwork and return your passport to you.
If staying in a private house, your host should register you with their local district OVIR (Department of Foreign Travel & Exit (they also deal with the registration of Foreign Citizens)) or on the electronic registration system Emehmon. If you travel to another city and plan to stay for longer than three days, you will need to register again. You must follow this procedure, as a full record of your whereabouts whilst in Uzbekistan is required upon departure. Visitors who are unable to account for their whereabouts could be fined and possibly deported.
If you are a tourist transiting Uzbekistan in a recreational vehicle or staying in tents/camping, you are responsible for your own registration. You should register online via the electronic registration system Emehmon within three days of arrival. During the online registration process there will be a tourist tax charge for each day of your stay. At the moment tourist tax can only be paid online by Uzbek debit card in local currency, therefore you should seek assistance from hotels or local tour operators.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 3 months beyond your date of entry to Uzbekistan.
Dual nationality
Dual nationality is not recognised in Uzbekistan. See Dual nationality for more information
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry (with a valid Uzbek visa), direct airside transit and exit from Uzbekistan. If your ETD has been issued in Tashkent, you’ll need an exit visa from the OVIR (Department of Foreign Travel & Exit) before you can travel out of Uzbekistan. This process can take at least 5 working days.
Customs declarations
You should fill out two copies of the customs declaration form on arrival. Make sure that both copies are signed and stamped by Customs officials. You will need to present one to the customs authorities as you enter the country and produce the other on departure. Any currency or valuables found in your possession and not declared on your customs declaration form may be confiscated.
Travelling with medicines
If you enter Uzbekistan with medicines, whether prescription or non-prescription, you should check in advance the list of prohibited medicines and the legal quantities of medicines that are allowed to be imported. You can find information on the website of the State Customs Committee of Uzbekistan.
You should carry a doctor’s prescription if you intend to travel with prescription medicines and declare the items on your customs declaration form. Some non-prescription medicines in the UK cause problems on entry into Uzbekistan, including codeine. Possession of these items can lead to administrative or criminal proceedings if you don’t have a prescription, or if you’re carrying more than you need for the visit and don’t declare them on arrival. Issues have most frequently been reported at land borders.
Border crossings
