Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Nigeria
International commercial flights to and from Niugeria are due to resume on 29 August..
The Nigerian Immigration Service announced the resumption of passport and migrant registration on 1 July.
The Nigerian authorities have advised that British nationals who exceed their authorised visa stays because of travel restrictions linked to coronavirus, will not be penalised for overstaying when they depart.
Testing / Screening on arrival
Passengers returning to Nigeria must have tested negative for COVID-19 within 2 weeks of their departure to Nigeria, and carry evidence of the test and result. On arrival all passengers will be screened by Port Health Officials and be required to complete a health declaration form and provide full contact details, including their address in Nigeria. Passports will be retained by the Nigerian immigration authorities until the 14 day quarantine period is complete.
Quarantine requirements
All new arrivals are expected to self-isolate at one location in the city of their arrival for 14 days where they will be remotely monitored by the Nigerian authorities. At the end of the 14-day period of self-isolation an exit interview will be conducted by Nigerian authorities. If the authorities are satisfied that there are no indications of COVD-19 they will authorise the release of the retained passport.
Anyone that has developed symptoms of coronavirus during their travel will be required to undergo quarantine at a government-monitored hotel.
