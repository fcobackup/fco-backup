Terrorist attacks in Argentina can’t be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. Since 2004 there have been a number of small explosions in Buenos Aires and the surrounding provinces which are believed to have been the work of local anti-globalisation groups. The targets have mostly been banks.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
