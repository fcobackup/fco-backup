Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities. A test can be booked on the Government of Rwanda online platform.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 in Rwanda before returning to the UK, the local authorities will expect the vast majority of people to self-isolate at home for 14 days or until you test negative for COVID-19. If you are visiting and staying in a hotel, you may be asked to self-isolate in your room, or to relocate to another hotel or another floor in your current hotel.
If you test positive, the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC) will follow up and offer further tests until you test negative. You will be expected to self-isolate after testing positive and the RBC will conduct checks to ensure self-isolation compliance.
The RBC will monitor your symptoms and if they are serious, you may be moved to a treatment centre.
Further information about what to do if you test positive for COVID-19 in Rwanda and how you can keep in contact with the health system can be found on the RBC website.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
