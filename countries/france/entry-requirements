This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in France set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to France for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
COVID-19 entry requirements
France has introduced a new system governing international travel to and from France. There are three categories of measures: green, amber and red. You should regularly check the status of the country you are travelling to or from on the French government’s website.
Travel between the UK and France
The UK is currently on France’s amber list. Please see the section below on all the requirements for travelling to France from an amber country.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test from a private coronavirus testing provider.
HGV or van drivers arriving in France from the UK are no longer required to provide a negative COVID-19 test to enter France. The latest information for HGV or van drivers is available on this UK government website.
Amber list countries:
The UK is currently on the French amber list.
If travelling to France from a country on the amber list, those who are not fully vaccinated will only be permitted to travel for essential reasons (from the list specified for this category of country). Those who are not fully vaccinated will also need to present the following documents:
a completed International Travel Certificate to confirm their essential reason for travel. In exceptional circumstances, the French Consulate in London may be able to assist with travel for an essential reason not listed on the International Travel Certificate
a completed ‘sworn statement’ (déclaration sur l’honneur) form self-certifying they are not suffering from symptoms associated with coronavirus and have not been in contact with confirmed cases in the preceding fortnight, and that they will self-isolate for seven days after arrival. This can be found on the French government’s website
those travelling aged 11 years old or over, will need evidence of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure, or an antigen test within 48 hours of departure. There will be random antigen testing for unvaccinated arrivals.
Travellers who are not fully vaccinated will need to self-isolate for 7 days after arrival, then take another PCR test following this period of self-isolation.
Travellers who are fully vaccinated do not need an essential reason to travel to France and do not need to self-isolate on arrival. Fully vaccinated travellers will need to present the following documents:
those travelling aged 11 years old or over, will need evidence of a negative PCR test result taken within 72 hours of departure, or a negative antigen test result taken within 48 hours of departure
a completed ‘sworn statement’ (déclaration sur l’honneur) form self-certifying they are not suffering from symptoms associated with coronavirus and have not been in contact with confirmed cases in the preceding fortnight. This can be found on the French government’s website
proof of vaccination status
Further detail on who is considered fully vaccinated by the French government, and how you can prove your status, can be found below under ‘vaccination status’.
If you are not fully vaccinated, you will need to have an essential reason to travel from France to a country on France’s amber list. If you are fully vaccinated, you do not need to complete the certificate to leave metropolitan France, unless you are travelling to a country on France’s red list.
Green list countries:
The European area (defined by the French government as EU Member States, Andorra, Holy See, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino and Switzerland) is currently on the French green list. The full list of countries on the green list is available from the French government.
If travelling from a country on the green list, travellers will not need to have an essential reason to enter France or to self-isolate.
If you are fully vaccinated you will not need a pre-departure test.
If you are not fully vaccinated, you will need to present a negative PCR or antigen test result from within 72 hours of departure.
All arrivals will need a completed ‘sworn statement’ (déclaration sur l’honneur) form self-certifying they are not suffering from symptoms associated with coronavirus and have not been in contact with confirmed cases in the preceding fortnight. This can be found on the French government’s website.
The French government does not impose restrictions on travellers leaving France for a country on its green list.
Red list countries:
The full list of countries on the French red list is available from the French government. A full list of the documents you will need to complete can be found on the French government’s website.
If travelling from a country on the red list, you must have an essential reason for travel (from the list specified for this category of country).
If not fully vaccinated, you will have to self-isolate for 10 days, and could be subject to security checks.
If you are fully vaccinated, you will need to self-isolate for 7 days.
If you are travelling from France to a country on the red list, you will need to complete the international travel certificate, to confirm your essential reason to travel.
Vaccination status
The French Government recognises the following vaccines: Pfizer, Moderna, Oxford/AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson (the vaccines recognised by the European Medical Agency). “Fully vaccinated” is defined by the completion of a vaccination schedule, specifically:
2 weeks after the second dose of Pfizer, Moderna, Oxford/AstraZeneca
4 weeks after the single and only dose of Johnson & Johnson
2 weeks after the single dose of any of the above vaccines if you have previously tested positive for COVID-19
Children under the age of 18 years old, who are travelling with fully vaccinated adults, will be exempt from requirements to self-isolate and provide an essential reason for travel, regardless of whether the minor has been vaccinated or not.
The French government have provided information on how to prove your vaccination status.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
If you live in England, France will accept the NHS COVID Pass or your NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. If you live in Scotland or Wales, France will accept your respective NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Travel from France to the UK
As the UK is subject to the French government’s amber list requirements, if you are not fully vaccinated and wish to travel from France to the UK you must complete a Certificate to leave Metropolitan France, which specifies exemptions for travel. If you are fully vaccinated, you are not required to present an essential reason for travel. No UK citizen or resident should be prevented from leaving France to travel to the UK. However, return to France will be subject to the restrictions outlined above.
If you intend to travel to England, Scotland, or Wales, including UK nationals returning home from travel abroad, you must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result, taken up to 3 days before departure. If you do not comply (and you do not have a valid exemption) your airline or carrier may refuse you boarding and/or you may be fined on arrival. You can access tests in France via the French government’s website. Travellers will then be subject to quarantine measures in place in the UK upon entry.
Travel to French overseas territories
Regular flights between metropolitan France and its overseas territories resumed in late June 2020.
There are different restrictions depending on which overseas territory you are going to. Please refer to the French government’s website to check the measures in place in each territory.
See also travel advice pages for the French overseas territory you are visiting.

Check our COVID-19 advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area, which France is part of, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training. Find more information here
If you are travelling to France and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the French government’s entry requirements. To see what your individual entry requirement might be, you should visit the France Visas website
if you stay in France with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
British citizens who are unable to return to the UK before the expiry of their visa / permit or the end of their visa-free limit due to COVID-19 restrictions should contact their local immigration authorities in France.
Any time you spent in France or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At French border control your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You should also be prepared to:
Queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA or Swiss citizens.
Show proof of where you intend to stay, for example, a booking confirmation or proof of address if visiting your own property (e.g. second home). Further information is detailed below.
Show proof of insurance for your trip. Please check the guidance on travel insurance here.
Prove that you have enough money for the duration of your stay. Further information is detailed below.
France categorises possible accommodation arrangements for visitors as follows:
Staying with family, friends or third party - you may be asked to provide an ’attestation d’accueil’ (welcome invitation) from your host if you are staying with friends or family. The French resident hosting you will need to obtain this attestation d’accueil from their local Mayor’s office, and send the original attestation before you enter France. You should also be prepared to show proof of funds of at least €32.50 per day, for the duration of your stay. If you do not have an ‘attestation d’accueil’ you should be ready to fulfil the requirements of option 4 below.
You have a second home in France - you will need to be able to prove ownership or tenancy of your property e.g. a tax or utility bill.
You are staying in a hotel or other commercially provided accommodation - you may be asked for confirmation of your reservation when entering France. You should also be prepared to show proof of funds of at least €65 per day for the duration of your stay.
You do not have an ‘attestation d’accueil’ or any pre-booked accommodation - in this instance, you may be asked to prove you have sufficient means for your visit, of at least €120 per day for the duration of your stay.
British citizens who are unable to return to the UK before the expiry of their visa/permit or the end of their visa-free limit due to COVID-19 restrictions should contact their local immigration authorities in France.
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in France. If you are resident in France, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on for residents, see our Living in France guide.
For further information on these requirements, visit the French government’s website on travel conditions for British citizens.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Travelling with children
From 15 January 2017, any child (under the age of 18) who is (a) living in France and (b) leaving France unaccompanied by a parent or guardian, must present the following documents on departure at the French border: (i) the child’s own ID card or passport, (ii) a completed AST authorisation form signed by a parent/guardian (Authorisation de Sortie du Territoire) and (iii) a copy of the ID card or passport of the parent or guardian who has signed the AST form. For more information visit the French Ministry of Interior website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from France.
Travelling with pets
If you wish to travel with a pet to the EU, please read our guidance.
On arrival in France, pet owners travelling with pets will need to enter through a designated travellers’ point of entry (TPE).
If your pet passport was issued in an EU Member State it remains valid for travel to France.
Customs checks upon entry into France
There are limits on the volume and value amounts for certain goods that you can bring into France as a traveller. You should check the French Directorate General of Customs and Excise website to confirm the latest allowances per traveller.
