At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronanvirus
On 12 March the Lebanese Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGCA) issued a circular which advised the following:
Immediate cancellation of all flights from China, Italy, South Korea, Iran.
That all airlines flying to Beirut Rafic Hariri Airport do not board passengers who have been in the UK, France, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Germany and Spain. This will affect those boarding direct flights from those countries, and those transiting through third countries to Lebanon. This decision came into force at 0000 on 13 March.
That Lebanese Nationals, those with Lebanese Residency, or those who are a member of a family of a Lebanese National can return to Lebanon from the affected countries up to, and including, 16 March.
Direct flights from the affected countries will then be suspended from 17 March, with the decision reviewed on 23 March.
There are exceptions for Diplomats and those working for International Organisations accredited to Lebanon until 17 March.
There may be further restrictions to entry and exit requirements to Lebanon, or flight options, at short notice, and if you have visited an affected country you may be denied entry at the border or asked to self-isolate for 14 days. From 17 March, direct flights to and from Lebanon from the countries listed above are suspended. Travel restrictions in others countries may also prevent you from transiting via third countries when travelling to and from Lebanon.
There are also restrictions on entry in effect at the Lebanese land border with Syria. Exemptions may be in place for Diplomats, those working for International Organisations accredited to Lebanon, Lebanese Nationals, those with Lebanese Residency, or those who are a member of a family of a Lebanese National until 16 March.
UK nationals are therefore strongly advised to immediately review travel plans to Lebanon, and contact their nearest Lebanese Embassy, airline and/or travel agency for further details.
The Government of Lebanon has also announced significant restrictions on movement, events, public and private spaces within Lebanon. Travelers are advised to comply with local restrictions
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lebanese embassy.
If you are in Lebanon and displaying symptoms of coronavirus (cough, a high temperature, shortness of breath) you should self-isolate, not go to a hospital, and telephone for medical advice. You can do this via your insurance/medical assistance company. Alternatively you can call the Lebanese Ministry of Health on +961 76592699.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
You can find more information about cases in Lebanon on the TravelHealthPro country page.
Local medical care
Medical treatment in Lebanon can be expensive. Most hospitals are well equipped. Doctors are generally well qualified though nursing standards vary. The majority of medical staff speak French and English. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Medical supplies may become increasingly scarce. You should therefore bring any medicines you need with you to Lebanon.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 112 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
