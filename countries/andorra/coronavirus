The Andorran authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and in line with measures taken in neighbouring France and Spain.
We recommend that British nationals who wish to leave Andorra contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
On 16 March the Andorran authorities announced a series of preventive measures, including the closure of most shops other than those selling food or other essential items such as pharmacies. This follows the cancellation of all leisure, cultural and sports activities organised by public administrations, and closure of ski resorts. Public transport is operating at a reduced capacity and schools, higher education institutions and vocational training centres are closed.
You can find more information regarding the measures in place on the Andorran government website (in Catalan).
If you believe you have symptoms, do not go directly to a hospital or healthcare facility. Instead, please call 116. For general information surrounding the measures introduced by the Andorran authorities, call 118.
You should refer to the Spain travel advice or France travel advice for information on the restrictions to movement in those countries, and follow the advice of the Spanish or French authorities if transiting through either country.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
