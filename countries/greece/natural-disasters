Earthquakes
Greece can experience earthquakes and earth tremors. You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake and follow advice given by the local authorities. The Greek General Secretariat for Civil Protection website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, and issues announcements about ongoing incidents.
A reported 5.1 magnitude earthquake occurred on 19 July in Magoula, Attica region, and was felt strongly in Athens. Local authorities are responding. If you’re in the region you should follow the advice of local authorities. Further information is available on the Greek General Secretariat for Civil Protection website
Forest fires
Forest fires often occur during the summer months across Greece due to the dry/hot weather.
Forest fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, and don’t light barbecues. Causing a forest fire is treated as a criminal offence in Greece even if unintentional. If you see a forest fire, call the emergency services on 112.
Forest fires can also cause travel disruption in wider areas. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the Greek Meteorological Service or European Meteorological Services, follow the advice of local authorities at all times and check with your travel provider for travel updates.
For further information on the risk of forest fires, visit the Civil Protection website. For severe weather warnings, visit the European Meteorological Services website.
