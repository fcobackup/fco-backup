The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
In response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Government of Guyana, announced the cancellation of all international flights from the Cheddi Jagan International Airport at Timehri and the Eugene Correia Airport at Ogle. The closure started on 17 March 2020 and is scheduled to last for the foreseeable future. Some repatriation charter flights are being allowed to leave Guyana.
From early in the pandemic many countries in the region closed their borders. That meant that only Barbados had direct flights to the United Kingdom. The High Commission have previously managed to facilitate charter flights to connect with such flights. However these direct flights to the UK from Barbados have now stopped and it is unclear when they will restart (please consult the Barbados Travel Advice for further information). There will therefore be no further charter flights to Barbados until further notice.
If you are a British national in Guyana or Suriname and wish to leave, you should contact the British High Commission by email at:returnfrom.guyana@fco.gov.uk, They will inform you as soon as departure options become available.
Borders
The Governments of Brazil and Suriname have both announced the closure of borders with neighbouring countries, including Guyana. There is no exit/entry available to Venezuela. Guidance for travellers coming to Guyana from a COVID-19 affected country is available from the Guyana Ministry of Public Health. The Guyana government hotline is +592 624 3067 and +592 227 4986 ext 215. Guyana is currently not allowing any visitors, or nationals, into the country.
Visas
British nationals do not need visas to visit Guyana. Visitors are generally given 30 days to remain in Guyana, but extensions can usually be obtained from the Ministry of Home Affairs in Georgetown. The Guyanese authorities are very severe on visitors who overstay or abuse the conditions of their stay. Conviction for overstaying will result in one year imprisonment, a fine of up to G$50,000 (Guyana dollars) and deportation - at the deportee’s expense - upon release.
Check entry requirements with the Guyana High Commission in London before you travel.

Passport validity
