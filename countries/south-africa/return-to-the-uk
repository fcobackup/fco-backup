South African airspace is closed to commercial airlines as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus. International commercial passenger flights are unlikely to resume for some time.
Land borders
Land borders to neighbouring countries are closed except for essential trade.
Flights
The British government has finished operating charter flights between South Africa and the UK. We are not planning any more of these flights.
Some other countries are still organising a limited number of repatriation flights, which British nationals may use to get connecting flights to the UK. All repatriation flights are subject to approval from the South African authorities. It is not uncommon for such approval to be granted after flights have been advertised. You should therefore check with all airlines offering flights whether their published schedules are confirmed or subject to change before booking tickets and travelling. If the flight is subject to change, you should check with your airline 48 hours before you travel to ensure the flight is still going ahead.
The British High Commission is not responsible for the organisation or approval of the flights listed below. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter.
