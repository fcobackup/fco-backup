All borders are closed for an initial period of 15 days with effect from 16 March. Peru announced a ban on all flights arriving from and departing to Europe and Asia, with effect from Monday 16 March. The ban is for 30 days and could be extended.
Peru is now processing diplomatic requests to enable flights to be exempted from the curfew. The British Embassy continues to work closely with the Peruvian authorities and commercial airlines on all possible options for a return to the UK for British nationals in Peru.
As part of their efforts, they are inviting British people in Peru to send their full name, location and best form of contact (ideally email address) to belima@fco.gov.uk. They will use this information to inform British nationals of the availability of outgoing flights secured through diplomatic permissions, which exempt them from the State of Emergency lockdown. They will communicate this to those who have contacted the Embassy via belima@fco.gov.uk and through social media channels.
Individuals who have already contacted the Embassy through other means up to and including 19 March have been logged, and do not need to re-register.
In the meantime, you should continue to contact your airline or tour operator regarding any possible return flights. This will ensure any existing reservations, whether in the past or the future, are logged in the airlines own assumptions about the number of people waiting to return to the UK. The British Embassy is in constant contact with the local authorities, airlines and other diplomatic missions to explore all possible avenues.
The British Embassy in Lima is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with advice and the latest available information on flight departure options for British nationals wishing to leave Peru.
