Travel in France
The health situation in France remains severe. France has put measures in place to limit the spread of Covid-19.
The French government announced a national lockdown from 30 October, with the relaxation of some measures coming into force on 28 November. A full list of circumstances under which you can leave your home is detailed on the French government’s website and includes shopping for food, attending medical appointments, looking after someone, and accompanying children to school. You can leave your home for exercise (including going for a walk) – but you must remain within one kilometre (extended to 20km from 28 November) of your home and be outside for no longer than one hour (extended to three hours from 28 November).
You will need an attestation (or self-certificate) when you do go out. The attestation is available on the Ministry of Interior website, and through the digital app ‘Tous anti-Covid.’
Travel between regions is not permitted, unless for a reason specified by the government. Public services and schools will remain open but restaurants, and cafes are closed. From 28 November, non-essential shops will be authorised to reopen until 9pm under strict sanitary protocols.

Public spaces and services
Wearing face masks in enclosed public spaces has been compulsory since 20 July. This applies to those aged 11 and over. Local authorities in an increasing number of cities and regions (including Paris), have extended this to also include outdoor public spaces. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine. Please refer to local guidance for more information.
Since 11 May, wearing masks on public transport has been compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen.
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.
