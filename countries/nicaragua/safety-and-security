Crime
Street crime is common in Managua, but also occurs in other large towns. Pickpockets and thieves operate on public transport and around bus terminals. Many criminals have weapons, and injuries and deaths have resulted when victims have resisted. If you are robbed, inform the police and get a signed and stamped copy of their report.
Express kidnappings have occurred involving passengers using unauthorised taxis, where cash is demanded for release a short while later.
If possible, use radio-dispatched taxis. If you get a taxi on the street, use an authorised taxi, which has red plates, and the driver’s identification number, name and photograph clearly visible on the dashboard. Take note of the colour and number of the vehicle before you get in.
It is a common local practice to share taxis with strangers. If you prefer to avoid this, agree a fare with the driver for a solo journey. Always agree the fare before you set off. Assaults and robberies have occurred when using unlicensed taxis and when a stranger offers to call a taxi for you. Do not take a taxi if it has been called for you by someone you do not know well.
There are reports of violent crime in Nicaragua affecting foreigners. Keep the windows of your car closed and the doors locked.
Do not travel on buses after dark.
Take care when walking around, particularly in markets, bus stations, the area around the old cathedral in Managua and poorer areas of towns. Do not walk alone after dark.
Female visitors and residents should take care when walking or travelling alone, and should use reputable taxi companies. You may also want to read the advice for women travelling abroad.
Use hotels that are staffed at the front desk 24 hours a day and have adequate security measures.
Avoid wearing jewellery. Do not carry large amounts of cash, credit cards or other valuables.
Local travel
When demonstrations occur, they have led to disruptions to traffic and public transportation and we advise that you check local information carefully before undertaking any travel.
The North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN) is very remote. You should plan any travel to this area carefully.
Do not hike on volcanoes or in other remote areas without an experienced guide.
Although extensive de-mining operations have been carried out in rural areas of northern Nicaragua, some landmines may remain. Take care if you venture off the main roads.
Road travel
In addition to the difficulties mentioned above, road conditions are generally poor. There is no street lighting on the main highways between major cities and only minimal street lighting in towns. You should therefore avoid travelling at night. The standard of driving is low and the condition of vehicles, particularly taxis and buses is poor. There is a risk of drivers ignoring traffic lights and driving dangerously, including under the influence of alcohol.
Drivers of vehicles involved in serious injury or fatal road traffic accidents are often arrested and detained.
Right-hand drive vehicles may not be driven or imported into Nicaragua.
Air travel
During the wet season (April to October), it is usually better to fly to and from the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua on early morning flights because of the risk of severe storms later in the day.
Sea travel
Safety regulations and standards vary greatly. Although local law requires operators of public water-transport to have insurance, some operators still do not carry recognised insurance. You should check the operator’s insurance cover before beginning your journey.
Swimming and water sports
 
Take care if you are swimming or taking part in water activities. Strong currents off sections of Nicaragua’s Pacific coast have resulted in drownings. Warning signs are not posted and lifeguards and rescue equipment are not readily available.  
Political situation
Stay away from all demonstrations and gatherings, even if apparently peaceful, as these could result in outbreaks of violence.
Under Nicaraguan immigration law it is illegal for foreigners to involve themselves in internal national and local politics. There is serious risk of arrest if you take part in any protest, breach of the peace, or other activity that might be perceived as acting against the government.
Although Nicaragua’s national blue and white flag is widely flown by the authorities, its use, and colours, as a means of protest have led to arrests and imprisonment.
