Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 03 (or 103 from a mobile phone) and ask for an ambulance. The operator will likely only speak Tajik and Russian.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Tajikistan
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Tajikistan.
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Tajikistan. Read more about altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
Basic medicines including painkillers are available without a prescription. Phone a Tajik pharmacy in advance to check if your UK prescription will be accepted. You may need to get your UK prescription translated into Russian or Tajik. You can get a translation in Tajikistan– find an interpreter or translator.
Some prescription medications are not widely available. Medications often come under different brand names and Western brand name drugs may be counterfeit, so ask for the drug’s generic name. If your medication is not available, you may be able to get it couriered from a third country, though this could take time.
You may need to pay cash for medication
Healthcare in Tajikistan
Tajikistan has poor medical facilities and a shortage of basic medical supplies. Medical facilities outside Dushanbe are quite basic and in some locations almost non-existent.
Tajikistan has limited mountain rescue capability. This will be further limited in cases where individuals need rescue in high altitude or where weather conditions do not allow. Weather conditions can change rapidly at short notice, particularly in mountainous and high altitude locations.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Tajikistan where some staff will speak English.
