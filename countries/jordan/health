At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
In response to the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Jordanian authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures, including restrictions on entry to Jordan.
On 14 March the Jordanian Government announced that commercial flights in to and out of Jordan will be stopped and all land and sea borders will be closed at 23:59 on Monday 16 March; this decision will be reviewed on 30 March.
On 16 March, the Government of Jordan declared additional precautionary measures, with immediate effect. The measures include compulsory quarantine for all those arriving into Jordan. All passengers arriving through airports and border crossings from early on Monday 16 March are subject to a 14-day compulsory quarantine in designated hotel facilities set by the government, either in the Dead Sea region or in Amman. Passengers departing later on 16 March are required to sign before departure a declaration committing to enter such quarantine before being allowed to board. On arrival, through airports and border crossings, passengers will be transported directly to the designated quarantine areas.
British nationals in Jordan or intending to travel to Jordan are strongly advised to immediately review their travel plans and consult their insurance provider; tour operator, and transport or accommodation provider about the impact on their plans.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
Other health risks
Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in patients from Jordan have been reported to the World Health Organization. You can find more information on this virus on the website of the National Travel Health Network and Centre.
Temperatures in summer months can be very high. Drink plenty of water and use high factor sun-block.
Local medical care
Medical facilities outside Amman are basic. In an emergency you should seek treatment in Amman. Emergency treatment is also available in Aqaba. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. A list of medical practitioners is available here.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
