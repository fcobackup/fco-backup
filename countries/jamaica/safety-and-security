Crime
Crime levels are high, particularly in and around certain areas of Kingston and Montego Bay. Gang violence and shootings are common, and while these incidents are generally confined to inner city neighbourhoods there have been recent incidents outside of these where the risk of becoming a collateral victim does exist. Be especially cautious if you’re travelling to West Kingston, Grant’s Pen, August Town, Harbour View, Spanish Town and certain parts of Montego Bay, including Flankers, Barrett Town, Norwood, Glendevon, Rose Heights and Mount Salem.
The motive for most attacks on tourists is robbery. There are mobile police patrols, but you should take steps to protect yourself and your belongings. Be vigilant at all times, even if you’re staying with friends and family. Don’t walk alone in isolated areas or on deserted beaches, even during the day. Take particular care when withdrawing money from ATMs. Don’t carry large amounts of cash or wear eye-catching jewellery. Try to vary which restaurants you use. Using the same place too often might make you a target for thieves. Avoid using buses at night.
Most hotels and resorts are well guarded, but robberies can occur. Follow hotel security procedures. Use hotel safe, lock windows and doors and report suspicious activity. If you are in residential accommodation, make sure proper door locks and window grilles are fitted and consider employing a guard and fitting a house alarm. Gated and guarded compounds are normally the safest type of accommodation.
Criminals have targeted visiting British nationals and those returning to resettle permanently in Jamaica. Before returning to resettle, seek advice from the Jamaican High Commission in London and the local Jamaican Information Service. The Jamaican Constabulary Force have produced a safety and security guide for returning citizens.
There have been some violent incidents, including armed robbery, murder, rape and sexual assault, including the specific targeting of tourists and visitors. You should take care when using dating apps in Jamaica especially those used by the LGBT community. Criminals have used apps to lure foreign visitors into meeting in public spaces and later assaulting and robbing victims. You should maintain a high level of personal safety awareness, including at popular events. The FCDO has guidance for women travelling abroad that may be helpful.
Don’t resist in the event of an attempted robbery. If you need the police in an emergency, call 119.
Security operations
Security operations are ongoing and further activity including curfews could occur with little or no notice. You should exercise caution if you’re travelling to affected areas, particularly if travelling at night, and follow the advice of the local authorities, including any restrictions. These may also result in road closures or travel delays, and the operating hours of some businesses may be subject to change.
As part of security enhancement measures, the Government of Jamaica may impose a State of Emergency (SoE) or other measure with little warning. Such measures allow the military to support the police in joint security operations in response to recent violence and shooting incidents. Police and military checkpoints may be established on roads from time to time, and full cooperation with security forces is recommended.
Crowds and demonstrations
Public order incidents, demonstrations and large celebratory gatherings can occur across Jamaica, and may cause significant disruption to traffic and public transportation. You should avoid all demonstrations and exercise caution around large crowds; they have the potential to turn violent and are often used by criminals as cover for robbery and theft.
Local travel
The Jamaican police may impose curfews at short notice for specific towns or areas. 
Travel to and from Norman Manley International Airport
There have been outbreaks of violence in recent years in the Mountain View area on the route between Kingston and Norman Manley International Airport. Therefore, you should avoid the Mountain View Avenue route and use the alternative signposted Humming Bird route via South Camp Road instead.
There have been police reports of British nationals being robbed when travelling to private accommodation from Norman Manley International Airport. Be especially vigilant when travelling from the airport to your accommodation.
Air travel
Travellers can expect delays and cancellation of flights in and out of Jamaica at short notice. These can be as a result of poor weather conditions or operational problems.
Road travel
You can drive in Jamaica using a UK driving licence for up to 6 months. If you aren’t familiar with Kingston, don’t drive in the city. If you get lost, you risk putting yourself and your passengers in personal danger. Some hire cars and minibuses don’t have seatbelts fitted in the rear. Check with the hire car company before you arrive.
Road accidents and fatalities are common. Many roads are badly maintained with poor signage. Roads in rural areas are narrow, winding and poorly lit at night. Speeding and drink-driving are common.
Drive defensively, and take great care on the roads, whether you are in a vehicle or a pedestrian. Drivers and front seat passengers must wear seat belts at all times. Keep the windows up except when passing through a police checkpoint and doors locked. Be particularly vigilant when stopping at junctions or traffic lights. Criminals are known to use techniques which distract drivers to gain access to vehicles to steal handbags and other items of value.
Motorcycle riders must wear a helmet.
Hurricanes, tropical storms and road-works can temporarily block roads. Check your route in advance.
Only use Jamaica Tourist Board (JTB) approved taxis or minibuses for excursions, airport transfers and sightseeing. Don’t hail a taxi in the street and don’t share a taxi with strangers. Most hotels and resorts have assigned JTB drivers who carry photo ID and display a prominent blue JTB sticker on the front windscreen.
