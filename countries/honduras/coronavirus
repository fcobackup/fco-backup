Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Honduras. The Honduran authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The FCO strongly encourage non-resident British nationals in Honduras to consider leaving to avoid difficulties they will face if flights out of the country and the region are further restricted and they are unable to get home. See Return to the UK.
On 15 March 2020 Honduras closed its land, air and maritime borders for the transit of people. Borders will be open for the transportation of cargo and supplies. All public events remain suspended.
All businesses are closed, except supermarkets, markets, small stores, pharmacies, hospitals, hotels, petrol stations and private banks. Businesses that have permission to remain open must take precautions and keep people at least one meter apart from each other. In all cases, they must ensure that the number of people in these businesses do not exceed 50 people.
Honduran authorities have suspended academic activities in both public and private institutions for 14 days. All kinds of public gatherings are suspended for 14 days with the exception of religious activities which may go ahead but with precautions and measures suggested by the international health organisation.
These measures include a curfew for seven days lasting until Sunday 22 March. The curfew is stricter in areas where there are confirmed cases: Choluteca, La Ceiba and Distrito Central, with San Pedro Sula, Puerto Cort√©s, Santa Cruz de Yojoa and El Triunfo added to the list on 19 March.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the Honduran immigration authorities or the nearest Honduran Embassy/Consulate.
