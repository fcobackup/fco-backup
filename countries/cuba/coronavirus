Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Cuba since 11 March 2020. The Cuban authorities have introduced a number of measures to counter the spread of coronavirus in Cuba.
There are significant implications for tourists and foreign residents. Where details were not given, the British Embassy in Havana has sought clarifications from the Cuban authorities.
Entry and borders
From midnight on 1 April 2020: all commercial and charter flights are suspended from entering or leaving Cuba until further notice; and, all foreign sea vessels are to leave Cuban waters. On sea vessels, there may be exceptions made by Cuban authorities on the grounds of health, fuel or technical problems.
Since Monday 23 March (midnight), only Cuban nationals and foreign residents of Cuba have been allowed to enter Cuba, who were put in government-managed self-isolation accommodation for 14 days. These measures are likely to be in place for 30 days and is subject to review. Returning residents were taken to their province of residence for quarantine.
On 1 April, the Cuban government announced that anyone who arrived in Cuba between 17 and 23 March will be tested for Coronavirus.

Measures for tourists
Tourists staying in hotels will be confined to those hotels. They cannot leave the hotel unless there are essential reasons, e.g. to get money, go to the clinic, go to the airport (only when flights resume). All excursions are suspended. A medic will visit the hotel twice per day. As the number of guests in hotels reduces, the hotels will close and the guests will be moved into one hotel.
Tourists can only stay in authorised casas particulars (private houses), and must stay in the house until they are moved to government hotels. The government will cover the transport. The cost of the hotel may not be the same as the private house.
Tourists who did not leave on the scheduled commercial flights (last one on 1 April 2020) will have to stay in a designated hotel until the Government of Cuba reviews the measures.
All discos, nightclubs, gymnasiums, etc (government or private owned for public access, and in hotels) will be closed.
Restaurants and bars will be restricting services; only delivery or take away services will be allowed unless exceptions are made.
Camp sites will be closed.
Tourists can only move around for essential trips and in officially authorised and licensed transport, e.g. yellow taxis to go to a clinic.Tourists can no longer rent cars.
Other local measures
Areas of Havana (parts of Cerro and El Carmelo in Vedado so far) have been designated as quarantine areas to combat further spread of COVID-19. It could happen elsewhere. In these areas, a limited number of people will be given permission to leave and return, e.g. people in essential jobs. There will be designated entry and exit points. Everyone leaving will be tested for COVID-19. No traffic will be allowed in other than essential services and supplies organised by the authorities.
Transport between provinces will be suspended. Urban transport services will be limited from 11 April to essential services and fewer people will be allowed to travel in a bus or car. Masks will be compulsory. Private taxi services will be suspended.
People in queues must maintain a minimum of distance of one metre between them. There will be an increased police presence in the streets and shops, to monitor that people are following the measures.
Cubans who are dual nationals are subject to Cuban measures and should check their immigration status to clarify if they can leave Cuba while current travel restriction are in place (and when flights resume).
Further information
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the Cuban immigration authorities or the nearest Cuban Embassy/Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
If coming to Cuba, you should pack sanitary hand gel, handkerchiefs and other essential items that may prevent transmission, as these items are not always available in Cuba.
