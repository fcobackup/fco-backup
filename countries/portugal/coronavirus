Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Portugal. The Portuguese authorities have put in place a series of measures to limit the spread of the virus. If you are currently in Portugal, follow the advice of local authorities.
Portugal declared a state of emergency on 18 March. This activated a series of measures including significant restrictions on movement throughout the country. These measures (available in Portuguese) affect:
Public places and transport
Public gatherings are banned, most shops other than those selling food or other essential items such as pharmacies are closed. All citizens have been instructed to remain at home unless they need to carry out one of the following activities:
to buy food or other essential items
to go to work if unable to work from home
to go to hospital or health centres
to carry out caring or similar duties or in case of real need
to return to their primary residence
to exercise outdoors or walk pets, for short periods and never in groups
Public transport services are operating at reduced levels.
Though not mandatory, the Portuguese health authority has advised the use of a non-surgical mask in enclosed public spaces, such as in supermarkets, shops and pharmacies and on public transport. Further information, in Portuguese, is available on the Portuguese Health authority website.
Campsites and motorhome parks
Campsites and motorhome parks are closed to tourists and visitors. If you are a permanent resident of a campsite or motorhome park you will not be affected.
Ports and vessels
Cruise ships can berth at ports on mainland Portugal, but passengers can only disembark if they are Portuguese nationals or residents. Recreational vessels and private yachts are not permitted to dock, except for refuelling or taking on supplies. Passengers may only disembark to return to their country of origin and once they have completed 14 days’ self-quarantine on board, starting from the day the vessel entered Portuguese territorial waters.
Madeira and the Azores
The regional governments of Madeira and the Azores recommend against all but essential travel to and from the archipelagos until further notice. If you are travelling to these regions you will be subject to health screening and mandatory quarantine for a period of 14 days. If you are travelling to Madeira, complete and submit this online form 24-48 hours before arrival. If you are travelling to the Azores, complete and submit this form 24-48 hours before arrival.
On 2 April, the regional government of the Azores imposed restrictions on movement between municipalities on the island of São Miguel, except:
to buy food or other essential items
to go to work (and provided you have an explanatory letter from your employer)
to go to hospital or health centres
to carry out caring or similar duties or in case of real need
Cruise ships and yachts will not be permitted to dock at any of the ports in Madeira, Porto Santo or the Azores.
