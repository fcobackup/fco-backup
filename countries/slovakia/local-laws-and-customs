You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

You must carry your passport (or Slovak identity card if you have one) with you at all times as identification. Keep it safe in a zipped up pocket or secure bag, and keep the details separately in case you lose it.
The Residence Permit card issued in Slovakia (Trvaly Pobyt) isn’t considered acceptable proof of identity and can’t be used to travel outside Slovakia. You’ll need to use your passport to leave the country.
Bratislava has become a popular destination for stag parties and tourists have been fined or imprisoned for causing a public nuisance. Unruly or rowdy behaviour between 22:00 and 06:00 is illegal and could attract the attention of the police. It is an offence in Bratislava Old Town to drink alcohol in the street. There may be exceptions for seasonal markets (such as the Christmas Market) and outside seating areas of restaurants and bars. But drinking alcohol (for example bought in a supermarket) in other public areas could result in a fine of €33.
Don’t get involved with drugs in any way. Penalties for smuggling, possession and use of drugs are severe.
Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as a military establishment or somehow security related, may result in problems with the authorities.
Same-sex relationships are legal in Slovakia, but same-sex marriages and civil partnerships aren’t recognised in Slovakian law. Public displays of affection may be frowned upon or attract unwanted attention. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
