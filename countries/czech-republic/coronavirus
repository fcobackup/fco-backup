Travel in the Czech Republic
There are various measures in place to control the spread of coronavirus. The details of these measures can be found in the sections below.
Public spaces and services
It is mandatory to cover your mouth and nose in all indoor and outdoor public spaces in built up areas with a face covering of surgical mask standard or higher. In places with a high number of people, such as public transport, shopping centres and medical facilities, you are required to wear a face covering of FFP2 standard or higher (in Czech known as ‘respirátor’). The Czech government advises that people adhere to social distancing of 2m where possible when in public.
Up to 2 people from different households are allowed to meet indoors and outdoors. Some shops and services are open and operating with social distancing measures in place. Restaurants and bars are closed, but some offer a takeaway service.
All cultural venues, including museums, galleries and theatres, are closed. Zoos and botanical gardens are open.
Full details of all restrictive measures in place including a list of open shops and services and rules on their operation, can be found in English on the Czech government Covid portal.
Schools are open for some age groups. UK nationals in need of specific information on education are advised to contact their local Czech authority.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Czech Republic
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
Residents of the Czech Republic, including British nationals, are eligible to receive the vaccine through the Czech national vaccination programme in accordance with their rollout plan. If you are currently eligible for a vaccine, i.e. you have residency in the Czech Republic and are 55+ or work as a health professional, teacher or a critical infrastructure worker, you can now register for a vaccine. Details of the national vaccination programme and the online booking system are available on the Ministry of Health website.
The Czech Ministry of Health has recently updated the online booking system and UK nationals can now register for a vaccine by using their health insurance number instead of a birth registration number. The health insurance number is provided by your Czech health insurance company and can be found on the insurance card issued by the company, in the box labelled “číslo pojištěnce”.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
