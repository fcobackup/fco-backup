There are a limited number of commercial options to return to the UK from Estonia.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Estonia you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Estonia because commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no special charter flight is advertised here.

Road
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
