Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Panama. The Panama authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Local measures
On 23 March 2020 President Cortizo announced an extension to the national curfew which is now in place between 5pm and 5am, effective from 5pm on 24 March 2020 with limited exemptions. You should not leave your accommodation during these times unless it is an emergency.
On 15 March, Panamanian authorities announced new restrictions on access to medical services for routine care, as well as widespread closures of commercial and leisure establishments. Further restrictions were announced on 20 March.
Commercial businesses have been ordered to close, except for supermarkets, pharmacies, health clinics, fuel stations and other key businesses. Supermarkets can have no more than 50 people inside.
Members of the public have been urged to wear masks while visiting establishments that are permitted to remain open.
The police and security forces are empowered to enforce restrictions on movements and events due to the current state of emergency. You should follow their instructions.
Sanitary cordon
On 19 March 2020, the Panamanian Government began establishing sanitary cordons in different provinces of the country, including Panama City, with checkpoints in various locations. The Panamanian Government may change suddenly the provinces that are sanitary cordons, and may introduce other restrictions on movement. These are posted on the Panamanian Ministry of Health Twitter feed.
You should avoid any unnecessary travel to and from any of the listed areas. If you urgently need to travel, you will need to show ID and proof of your reason for needing to cross the checkpoint in order to pass, such as evidence of your flight out of Panama.
