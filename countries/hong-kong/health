At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus in China. The virus originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province but cases have been confirmed in other parts of China, including Hong Kong.
On 28 January the Hong Kong SAR Government announced a series of measures designed to prevent the spread of the virus. These measures include the suspension or scaling back of flights, trains, ferries and buses between Hong Kong and mainland China.
The Hong Kong SAR Government has stated that all border crossings with mainland China will remain closed indefinitely from 4 February 2020, with the exception of the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. All ferry crossings between Hong Kong and mainland China, and Hong Kong and Macao will also cease. On 5 February, the Government announced that Kai Tak Cruise and Ocean Terminals would also be closed to passengers indefinitely.
From 12.01am on 8 February, all those who have been to mainland China in the past 14 days, irrespective of whether they have visited Hubei Province, will be required to undertake 14 days of mandatory home quarantine.
Those transiting through Hong Kong airport will not be automatically subject to mandatory quarantine, but will be subject to advanced screening measures, including temperature checks. Those deemed to have high temperature will undergo further checks by the Port Health Office at the airport. If they meet further risk criteria, they will be transferred to Hong Kong public hospital for mandatory further checks/treatment.
Anyone found to be lying about their travel history could face punitive measures. For more information, see this Hong Kong SAR Government press release.
If you’re returning to the UK from Hong Kong, consult the latest advice from the Department of Health and Social Care on actions you should take if you develop symptoms on your return.
Further advice on coronavirus is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
Health risks
Mosquito-borne diseases like dengue fever occur all year round. You should take appropriate precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. UK health authorities have classified Hong Kong as having a risk of dengue virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with dengue fever visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) website.
You may undergo temperature screening at borders. Depending on the results, further medical examinations may be required.
Medical treatment
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. The cost of medical treatment in Hong Kong is high.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
