COVID-19 restrictions in New Zealand are subject to change at short notice and can apply regionally or nationally. On 12 September 2022, New Zealand announced the removal of most COVID-19 restrictions. This includes removal of mandatory mask wearing in most settings and removal of all vaccination and testing requirements for incoming travellers and air crew. Masks are only required in healthcare and aged care settings.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will still be required to isolate for seven days from symptom onset, but members of your household will no longer be required to isolate as long as they return a negative RAT test each day. Although not mandatory, some businesses, public venues and events in New Zealand may continue to require evidence of vaccination status and mask use.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
