There are a limited number of commercial options to return to the UK from Estonia.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Estonia you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Estonia because commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no special charter flight is advertised here.
