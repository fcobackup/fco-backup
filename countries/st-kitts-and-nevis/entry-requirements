The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
A travel advisory is in place. Travellers from the UK are currently not allowed to enter St Kitts and Nevis. Once the advisory has been lifted, all travellers from the UK must have received two doses of COVID vaccine and submit online notification to the St Kitts and Nevis authorities.
Fully vaccinated travellers will be asked to “Vacation in Place” at a Travel Approved hotel for a period. Check the latest guidelines on the St Kitts Tourism website.
Visitors will be able to leave quarantine after 5 days once negative PCR tests have been received. Whilst in quarantine, visitors will not be allowed to move freely around their hotel.
Vaccinated parents travelling with a non-vaccinated child under 18 will not be allowed to integrate into St Kitts and Nevis until PCR tests for the child taken on day 14 have come back negative.
Travellers should regularly check the St Kitts Tourism Authority websites St Kitts Tourism and Nevis Tourism Authority for updates and information on pre-travel authorisation, documentation required, permitted hotels and other travel requirements. Changes may take effect at short notice.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Demonstrating your vaccination status from the UK is not formalised for entry into St Kitts and Nevis, so you should follow alternative advice for entry. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
