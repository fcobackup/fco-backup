The Republic of Cyprus government has announced stricter measures on UK nationals entering Cyprus applicable from 14 March. All UK nationals arriving in Cyprus from that date should self-isolate for 14 days. Those who are due to leave the country before the end of 14 days may do so provided they do not display symptoms. UK nationals who arrived in Cyprus prior to 14 March are not affected by these measures. The above measures are expected to remain in place until further notice.
The administration in the north of Cyprus has introduced a temporary ban on British nationals entering the north of Cyprus from 12 March. This ban, aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), does not apply to British nationals with residency status in the north of Cyprus. The administration also requires anyone who enters the north of Cyprus to self-isolate for 14 days if they have arrived on the island from a range of countries / territories, including the UK, within the last 14 days. Anyone entering self-isolation is required to complete the full period of 14 days before leaving again. Some crossing points between the north and the south of the island have been temporarily closed. See Health
