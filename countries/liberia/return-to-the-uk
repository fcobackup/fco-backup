Given the rise of the number of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) the Government of Liberia has announced the suspension of all commercial flights (except cargo, charter and special flights) for 21 days, effective 23:59 GMT 23 March. This will run until 14 April.
We are not advising British nationals resident in Liberia to leave as the risks of quarantine for them are much lower.
Keep up to date with real-time information from your airline, tour operator or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
