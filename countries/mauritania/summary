The FCO advise against all travel to:
the province of Tiris Zemmour (except the town of Zouérat)
the province of Adrar (east of Atar)

Following the attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March, and subsequent US airstrikes, tensions may be raised across the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Mauritania, including kidnapping. You should be especially vigilant in public places and monitor local media. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
Consular support is not available from the British Embassy in Nouakchott. If you’re in Mauritania and need consular support, you should contact the British Embassy in Rabat, Morocco.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
