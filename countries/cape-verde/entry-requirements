You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Prior to your travel you will need to complete and submit:
the Airport Security Tax Form (TSA) on the EASE website and pay 3,400 escudos (approximately £30). This does not apply to visitors under 2 years of age or those who are normally resident in Cape Verde. (See Visas). If you’re travelling with a tour operator, check whether the cost of the TSA is included in your package.

Screening on arrival
Your temperature will be taken on arrival in Cape Verde. If it is high, you will be taken to an assigned area at the airport where it will be measured again. If your temperature remains high, the Cape Verde authorities may need you to do a COVID-19 test.
If you arrive in Cape Verde without a negative COVID-19 test, you won’t be allowed to disembark. In exceptional circumstances, the Cape Verde authorities may allow you entry but you will have to take a COVID-19 test at your own expense.
