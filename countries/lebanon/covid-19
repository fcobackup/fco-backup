Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Lebanon. The Lebanese authorities have announced a number of measures and restrictions to limit the spread of the virus.
Travel and borders
On 15 March, the Lebanese authorities announced the closure of Lebanon’s borders, including Beirut Rafic Hariri Airport, effective from March. The decision will be reviewed on 29 March.
There will therefore be no routes in or out of Lebanon for British nationals from 15 March. You are therefore strongly advised to immediately review travel plans to Lebanon, and contact your nearest Lebanese Embassy, airline and/or travel agency for further details.
There are some exceptions to the closure, including for diplomats accredited in Lebanon and those working for international organisations. Those with Lebanese nationality, Lebanese residency or who are a member of a family of a Lebanese national should contact their nearest Lebanese Embassy.
Entry into Lebanon by travellers who have recently visited the UK (and several other countries) was suspended from 12 March. As a result, direct flights to and from the UK are also suspended. Those who have recently been in affected countries may, on arrival in Lebanon, be required to spend 14 days in self-isolation or turned around at the border, or be denied boarding a plane if transiting to Lebanon via a third country.
British nationals may be able to travel from Lebanon back to the UK (and other destinations) via third countries up to 18 March, before Beirut Rafic Hariri airport closes on 19 March. However, restrictions on flights from Lebanon, and travel restrictions in other countries, may prevent this. Changes to restrictions to entry and exit requirements in third countries, and flight options, are likely to change at short notice.
Public measures
The Lebanese authorities have also announced a lock-down in Lebanon. This will be reviewed on 29 March. This means that:
Individuals must remain at home. Public and private gatherings are banned
Public departments, municipalities, unions, universities, public and private schools, and nurseries are closed, with the exception of core institutions, including security agencies, hospitals, pharmacies and banks (though ATMs and electronic transfers are functioning)
All private companies and stores are closed, with the exception of bakeries, supermarkets, and haulage companies.
You should comply with local restrictions introduced by the Lebanese authorities.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Lebanese embassy.
Further information
If you’re in Lebanon and displaying symptoms of coronavirus (cough, a high temperature, shortness of breath) you should self-isolate, not go to a hospital, and telephone for medical advice. You can do this via your insurance/medical assistance company. Alternatively you can call the Lebanese Ministry of Health on +961 76592699.
