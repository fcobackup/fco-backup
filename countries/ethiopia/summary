There is a military conflict ongoing in northern Ethiopia. The conflict has potential to escalate and spread quickly and with little warning. The FCDO advises against all travel to Tigray, Amhara and Afar regional states. If you are in Tigray, you should leave where safe to do so. If you are in the vicinity of military activity and you cannot leave safely, you should stay indoors, away from windows and remain alert to developments that would enable you to leave safely. See Tigray Region, Amhara Region, Afar Region and Oromia Region.
On 2 November 2021, a nationwide State of Emergency was declared, with further directives being added since that date. This provides the police with greater powers to arrest and to search property, which they are using. Those of Tigrayan or Oromo ethnicity may face increased scrutiny, although this power could affect all people, including at the airport and through direct police operations. A small number of British nationals of Tigrayan ethnicity have been detained for a number of weeks without charge.
Under the State of Emergency, public meetings and demonstrations are banned; movement without ID is restricted, including when departing from Bole airport; curfews and roadblocks may be introduced with little or no warning; there is an enhanced security presence; publication of any military activity or views on the conflict that dissent from the Federal Government’s view, including on social media, is banned. You should avoid large gatherings and demonstrations. You should comply with the law, including on carrying ID cards, possession of foreign currency and possession of weapons. You should avoid confrontation and follow the instructions of the authorities. You should monitor local news and social media closely for further updates. See Addis Ababa
