Cape Town minibus taxi strikes
There are currently minicab taxi strikes in the Cape Town area. These strikes have the potential to turn violent and may impact multiple areas including journeys to and from the airport. Check for any disruption on your route before travelling, avoid violent protests and try to stick to major routes (for example the main N2 motorway route).  See safety and security situation for more advice.
