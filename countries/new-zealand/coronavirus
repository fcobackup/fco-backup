Travel in New Zealand
After confirmation of new cases of Covid-19 outside of Managed Isolation or Quarantine facilities, the New Zealand Government announced the re-introduction of some lockdown measures.
Auckland is currently at Level 2 of its Covid-19 Alert Level System. At 11:59pm New Zealand time on Wednesday 7 October it will move to Alert Level 1, bringing it into line with the rest of the country. You can find detailed information on the alert levels and the measures introduced from the New Zealand Government.
While not mandatory at Alert Level 1, Government advice encourages the use of face coverings on public transport and where it is not possible to maintain physical distance from people who you do not know, for example in supermarkets. The Government also encourages people to keep track of their movements and who they have seen to help with contact tracing, if required. A NZ COVID Tracer app is available to download for this purpose. Detailed information on face coverings is available from the New Zealand government.
Travellers may continue to undertake domestic travel by plane or road in order to connect with international flight departures from Auckland or Christchurch.
New Zealand’s border restrictions remain in place and public health measures remain unchanged (wash hands and high-touch surfaces regularly, stay home if sick, and get tested if symptomatic).

From 1 July 2020, foreign nationals experiencing serious hardship in New Zealand as a result of COVID-19 can apply to the New Zealand government’s Programme for Assistance for Foreign Nationals Impacted by COVID-19, which will provide temporary, in-kind assistance to eligible people to help meet basic needs such as food and accommodation. The Programme will run for three months. See the Programme website to check eligibility and apply. Further information is available on the New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs website.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
With effect from 1 August 2020, pre-departure COVID-19 testing will be mandatory for flights with Emirates and Etihad Airways. Further information on the specific requirements is available in the travel advice for United Arab Emirates.
The British High Commission in Wellington and Consulate General in Auckland are unable to offer certification or a negative test result. Those requiring testing should contact their GP or visit the Healthpoint website for further information on accessing medical services. Emirates have confirmed they will accept SMS/TXT notification of a negative test result, which passengers can present at the airport. The Travel Advice will be updated as further information comes available.
