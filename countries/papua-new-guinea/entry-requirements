Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Papua New Guinea.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Papua New Guinea’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Papua New Guinea set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Papua New Guinean High Commission in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Papua New Guinea, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive. 
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Papua New Guinea. Visas can be obtained in advance online or at a Papua New Guinea (PNG) Embassy or High Commission. Tourist/visitor visas can also be obtained on arrival at Jacksons International Airport in Port Moresby.
Applying for a visa
Apply for a Papua New Guinea visa online before you travel using the ‘Online Services’ tab on the Immigration & Citizenship Services Authority (ICSA) website.
PNG has recently reintroduced visa on arrival for certain categories of traveller. Details are available on the ICSA website. You may need to show evidence of an onward flight ticket.
Vaccine requirements
You must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Papua New Guinea guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Papua New Guinea, see:

duty-free allowances for travellers
You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
It is illegal to enter Papua New Guinea with many fruits, vegetables and animal products due to local quarantine controls.
