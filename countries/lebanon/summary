Protests which started on 17 October 2019 in response to new tax measures proposed by the Lebanese government are ongoing in Beirut and across the country. While protests have been generally peaceful, there has been sporadic violence, including clashes between protestors, security forces and supporters of political groups, as well as incidents of looting and vandalism. You should remain vigilant, avoid all protests, demonstrations and large political gatherings, and keep up to date with developments via local media and this travel advice.
As a result of protest activity, all major roads in and out of Beirut remain blocked. New road blocks may appear at short notice, including on roads to and from Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport. Limit your movements by road into and out of the city, plan any journeys carefully, seek local advice before departing and be prepared to change plans at short notice. Make sure you have sufficient cash, a charged mobile phone and adequate supplies of any necessary medication when travelling. If you’re travelling to or from the airport, check your flight status before leaving and allow extra time for your journey. If you’re unable to leave the airport, wait there until the authorities confirm access roads are open. If you need urgent consular assistance, call the British Embassy Beirut on 00 961 1 960 800.
The security situation in parts of Lebanon can deteriorate quickly. See Political situation
On 1 September 2019 there was an exchange of fire between the militant group Hizballah and the Israeli Defence Force, across the Blue Line with material damage but no reported injuries on either side. A conflict with Israel could spark with little warning with a rapid escalation in violence - you should keep up to date with the news and this travel advice while travelling.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Lebanon. You should be vigilant at all times, avoid crowds and crowded places and follow the advice of the Lebanese authorities. On 3 June 2019, 3 Lebanese security personnel were killed in Tripoli by a suspected militant. Be particularly vigilant at this time. See Terrorism
There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.
There are unexploded ordnance and land mines in many places. You should avoid travelling away from established paths, especially when hiking. This is particularly a concern in southern Lebanon. See Local travel
Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. Offences committed under the act – including funding and supporting proscribed organisations – may be liable to prosecution in the UK.
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Lebanon where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
