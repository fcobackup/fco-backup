Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Chad.

The authorities in Chad set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Chadian Embassy in Belgium or the Chadian Embassy in France, which does not have a website:

Passport validity requirements
To enter Chad, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.  
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.

Registering with the police
If you stay in Chad more than 72 hours, you must register with the police. The immigration officer will tell you to go to the Commissariat Central (police headquarters) on Avenue General Kerim Nassour (formerly Boulevard de Strasbourg). You must bring a passport photograph.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Chad, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
