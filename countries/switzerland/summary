The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Switzerland based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
Due to COVID-19 restrictions, UK nationals and other non-Swiss / EU / EFTA citizens arriving from the UK or a ‘high risk country’ are not permitted entry to Switzerland. However, exemptions do apply.
UK nationals who hold a residence or cross-border permit for Switzerland or Liechtenstein, or who are travelling from other Schengen countries, can enter Switzerland
Travellers arriving from the UK must complete an online contact tracing form before entering Switzerland.
Flights from the UK to Switzerland are limited. Travellers need to present a negative COVID-19 test result (PCR), carried out less than 72 hours before arrival. Children aged 12 or under are exempt from this requirement.
Travellers from the UK must quarantine for 10 days from arrival in Switzerland. You can reduce the quarantine period to 7 days with a new, negative COVID-19 test result (rapid antigen test or PCR) and have approval from the local cantonal authority
UK nationals are currently unable to transit Geneva Airport to enter France unless you hold a residence or cross-border permit for Switzerland.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
