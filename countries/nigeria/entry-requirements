The authorities in Nigeria set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You will need a valid visa to enter or travel through Nigeria as a visitor.
See Visas section for more information.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Prior to departure, all passengers travelling to Nigeria must register and complete the on-line pre-boarding health declaration at the Nigeria International Travel Portal.
Travellers must present two documents at their point of departure. A verifiable proof of vaccination certificate and a permit to travel certificate, which will be obtained after completion of the pre-boarding health declaration.
From 00:01am on Monday, 4th April, 2022 in-bound passengers to Nigeria who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 are no longer required to carry out a COVID-19 PCR test.
Fully vaccinated passengers arriving in Nigeria will not be required to carry out a post arrival PCR test or a rapid antigen test upon arriving in Nigeria.
Proof of vaccination status
On arrival in Nigeria, where applicable you must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated.
Nigeria will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. You should also carry a printed offline copy. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least two weeks prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Nigeria doesn’t accept UK’s proof of recovery.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Prior to departure, all passengers travelling to Nigeria must register and complete the on-line pre-boarding health declaration at the Nigeria International Travel Portal.
Passengers must have tested negative for COVID-19 within 48 hours of their departure to Nigeria, and have uploaded their PCR test certificate to the on-line Travel Portal.
Passengers must carry evidence of the test and result when they travel. Only a COVID-19 PCR test is acceptable to the Nigerian authorities. Passengers must also provide a copy of the permit to travel certificate, which will be obtained after completion of the pre-boarding health declaration.
Partially or unvaccinated passengers must also book and pay for a repeat PCR test for day 2 of their arrival and a day 7 post-arrival exit PCR test. Evidence of test booking will be required on arrival. This must be booked through the Nigeria International Travel Portal.
On arrival all passengers will be screened by Port Health Officials and be required to provide full contact details, including their address in Nigeria. The Nigerian government has said it will closely monitor whether passengers are following the quarantine measures and conducting the repeat PCR test.
Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated passengers must self-isolate for 7 days on arrival, until they receive a negative COVID-19 test result from their day 7 PCR test.
