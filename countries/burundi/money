You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

Take US dollars dated post-2006. Most outlets and individuals will not accept or exchange older currency. Euros may also be exchanged. There’s a shortage of foreign exchange currencies in Burundi.
Credit and debit cards are accepted in some places, (including Bon prix shops / Rocagolf and Club du Lac hotels) but rarely outside Bujumbura. ATMs are available, mainly in Bujumbura.
