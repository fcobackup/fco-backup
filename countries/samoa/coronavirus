The Samoan authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. A State of Emergency was declared on 20 March by the Government of the Independent State of Samoa. Effective immediately, Samoan borders have closed to entry by all foreigners. You should monitor the health advisory website.
To transit through Australia before 1200 AEDT on 24 March you need to have applied for exemption. You can find out more information on this and apply here. Please contact our Sydney consulate once you have requested your exemption so we are aware.
The New Zealand government has announced, with strict health and onward flight criteria, the ability for travellers from Pacific Island Countries to transit NZ; this ability to transit may change at short notice and is only available for a short period. More information on this is available from Immigration New Zealand.
The Government of Australia has announced that from 9pm Australia Eastern Standard Time on 20 March, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March. As many flight connections to and from Samoa connect in Australia and New Zealand, options to depart Samoa are likely to reduce. If you’re currently a visitor in Samoa, you’re advised to prepare to leave as soon as possible. If you’re resident in Samoa, you should be aware of the potential impact of the border closures and flight restrictions on future travel plans.
