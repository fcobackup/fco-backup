Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in New Zealand. The New Zealand authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
As of 11.59pm local time on 19 March 2020, most foreign travellers can no longer enter New Zealand.
New Zealand citizens, permanent residents, residents with valid travel conditions, and their immediate family (partner or spouse, legal guardian, and dependent children under the age of 24) travelling with the New Zealand citizen can still come to New Zealand.
The New Zealand Government has announced, with strict health and onward flight criteria, the ability for travellers to transit New Zealand; this ability to transit may change at short notice and is only available for a short period. More information on this is available from Immigration New Zealand. Further information will be shared on the British High Commission’s Facebook and Twitter sites when available.
If you’re in New Zealand, follow the New Zealand guidance to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival – see New Zealand Ministry of Health website. You should contact your insurance company and airline for the latest travel information, and contact i-SITE if accommodation is needed.
Returning residents and citizens will be required isolate themselves for 14 days upon arrival.
If a British National is required to self-isolate in New Zealand and does not do so, they may be detained and may face deportation.
Given the fast changing situation, you should check the latest entry requirements for your destination on the New Zealand Immigration website or check with your airline before you travel.
