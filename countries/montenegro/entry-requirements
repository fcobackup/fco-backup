This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Montenegro set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Montenegro Embassy, London.
Land and border crossings may close at short notice and entry into neighbouring countries may be subject to entry requirements.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Montenegro.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Montenegro, your passport must:
issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’) 
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’) 
Check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. 
Contact Montenegro’s embassy in the UK if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Checks at border control
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
The dated entry stamp helps avoid any problems about the length of your stay in the country.
Visa requirements
You can travel to Montenegro for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa.  
If you are travelling to Montenegro without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Montenegro within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days. 
Montenegro is not part of the Schengen Area, so your time spent in Montenegro does not add to your total number of days spent in the Schengen Area.
Applying for a visa
To stay longer (to work or study or for other reasons), you must meet the Montenegrin government’s entry requirements.
Check which type of visa or work permit you may need with the Montenegro Embassy in the UK.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Montenegro guide.
Registering with the authorities
Unless you are staying in a hotel or other commercial accommodation, you must register with the local immigration authority within 24 hours of arrival in Montenegro.  
You can register your stay at Tourism Organisation Information Points or at a police station in the town or city where you are staying. If you are staying in a hotel, this is done automatically when you check in. If you are staying in other commercial accommodation, check with your host.  
If you do not register you may be fined, detained, or face a court appearance.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Montenegro.
You should declare items of value like expensive jewellery, photographic and computer equipment or anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking pets into Montenegro
Montenegro accepts pet passports. Pets can be transported non-commercially (up to 5 pets) as long as they meet the medical and other requirements for bringing pets into EU countries.
Taking money into Montenegro
Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 euros or more. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. If you do not, your money could be seized when you leave.
