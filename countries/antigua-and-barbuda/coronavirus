You will be contacted by the Health Authorities and instructed to self-isolate or move to a quarantine facility. This will be determined by the Quarantine Authority. You may be instructed to stay at the Government’s Quarantine facility. This would be at a charge of XCD 82 per night. You may also need to seek treatment there. Minors will be subject to the same regulations as adults.
