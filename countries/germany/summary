The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
The whole of Germany based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
The German government has restricted air and sea travel into Germany at its external Schengen borders. Travellers from the UK are currently only permitted to enter Germany if they are returning to their place of residence, if they serve in an important role or if they have an urgent need.
Travellers arriving in Germany who have been in the UK in the preceding 10 days must present a negative Covid-19 test to border officials whilst entering Germany. Airline passengers will have to present their negative test at the start of their journey. The result can be in either paper or electronic form. The test must have been taken less than 48 hours before entry to Germany. Children aged five or under are exempt from the test requirement. Even with a negative test, travellers will still be required to self-isolate for 10 days following arrival in Germany, with the possibility of test and release after 5 daysdays in some areas. Contact your local public health authority for further details on test and release.
If you are returning to the UK from Germany, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
The FCDO is not advising those already travelling in Germany to leave at this time. Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. You should contact your tour operator or airline if you have any questions about your return journey.
Travel is subject to possible quarantine
There are COVID-19-related testing and quarantine requirements on arrival into Germany from any part of the UK. See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
