Crime
Crime levels are low, but there are occasional incidents of petty crime against tourists as well as house burglaries. Take particular care of your passport, avoid carrying valuables with you and do not leave possessions in unattended vehicles, even if out of sight in a locked boot.
Female visitors and residents should take care when walking or travelling alone. You should remain aware of your surroundings and take sensible precautions. See these travel tips for women travellers.
Road travel
Drivers of vehicles not registered in Brunei can only buy motor fuel at 14 designated filling stations throughout the country, to a maximum of 250 litres. Petrol stations will only sell premium “V-Power” fuel to foreign cars. Cash payments are the norm.
You can drive in Brunei with a valid UK driving licence for up to 90 days after which you will need to apply for a Bruneian licence.
Driving standards differ from the UK. Traffic will not always stop at red lights or pedestrian crossings. Speeding and non-use of seatbelts and infant car seats is common. Road conditions are generally good but you should take extra care while driving through heavy rain as road surfaces are uneven. Be aware that there could be animals such as monitor lizards, snakes and monkeys on the road.
If you’re involved in a road accident as a driver, you should not leave the scene or move the vehicle until the police have attended.
Trekking
Police advise individuals against hiking alone in the forest, including at well-known recreation areas. It’s easy to get lost when visiting the rainforest. Use recognised and well-known guides, and stay on the footpaths. Always carry water (heat stroke can be an issue) and emergency sweets with you and consider carrying a whistle (in case you need to attract attention) and a torch if hiking in the afternoon (in case you take longer than you think and it gets dark).
Political situation
Demonstrations or large public gatherings are unlikely in Brunei. Keep yourself informed through the local media.
