Crime
There have been incidents of armed banditry, car-jacking and kidnap across the country. Bandits and smugglers are present along Mali’s northern borders and pose a risk to travellers, especially after dark.
In case of emergency, you can contact the Malian authorities on +223 80 00 11 15 or +223 20 23 95 11.
Local travel
The FCDO advise against all travel to the provinces of Tombouctou, Kidal, Gao and Mopti, as well as parts of the provinces of Kayes, Koulikoro, Sikasso and Segou. The FCDO advise against all but essential travel to the rest of Mali, including Bamako.
Political unrest is an ongoing risk. You should remain vigilant and monitor local media for any developments.
Inter and intra-communal security incidents persist in many parts of the country, most notably in Mopti and Segou regions. In some instances, terrorist groups have become involved in these conflicts In March 2019, 160 villagers were killed by masked gunmen in a single attack in Ogossagou in central Mali. Landmines are used by groups operating in Centre, North and North East Mali.
The security situation in Segou and Sikasso has sharply declined since 2020 with a string of notable attacks in Segou region and increasing levels of terrorist related activity in Sikasso region. See Terrorism
On 1 June 2022, gunmen targeted and killed three aid workers in the Kayes region (bordering Senegal and Mauritania). There have been other known attacks on aid workers across the country.
Travel in Mali can be difficult and conditions are poor for overland travel. You should take all necessary safety precautions, especially outside of main urban areas, have confidence in your security arrangements and maintain a high level of vigilance.
Political situation
On 3 July, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) announced the reopening of land and air borders between Mali and ECOWAS countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Côte D’Ivoire, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo), which had been closed since January.
On 24 May 2021, a second military coup resulted in the arrests and resignation of the former transitional President Bah N’Daw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane. Colonel Assimi Goïta, former Vice President, has assumed control and appointed a government for the rest of the transition period.
Large-scale political protests have taken place in Bamako and some other regional towns. These have sometimes turned violent resulting in burning of tires, clashes with the police, blockage on the roads and bridges, the deployment of tear gas, and small arms fire. There have previously been reports of several deaths and injuries. Protests and civil disobedience have increased in frequency. You should avoid large gatherings, remain vigilant and monitor local news.
Protests, marches and demonstrations can occur with little prior notice and may see a heavy police and security presence. Protests have taken place recently in Bamako and other cities across Mali. If you become aware of any nearby protests, marches or demonstrations, you should leave the area immediately, remain vigilant, and follow the local news as the atmosphere can change quickly and without warning. You should stay away from any blockades set up by the police and security forces.
Road travel
Night-time checkpoints operate in Bamako at various locations. Checkpoints are in place from approximately 9pm until dawn.
Keep vehicle and personal identification documents with you at all times while travelling by road. Approach security checkpoints slowly and comply with instructions given. There have been incidents late at night where people dressed as policemen have demanded money from drivers in Bamako. Ask to see identification. Don’t resist if the person is armed.
Road conditions off the main roads are often poor, especially in the rainy season (June to October). Other road users may drive dangerously. You should take particular care and attention when driving in urban centres.
In the case of a vehicle accident, go to the nearest police station to file a report immediately. If you remain on the spot you may be vulnerable. Medical help in the event of an accident is likely to be limited.
Air travel
The FCDO can’t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes lists of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list isn’t exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s unsafe.
You can find a list of recent incidents and accidents on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
Scams
Foreign nationals are targets for online scams. Treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who operates in West Africa.
