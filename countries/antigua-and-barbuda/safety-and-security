Crime
Most visits are trouble-free, but there have been incidents of violent crime including murder, armed robbery and sexual assault.
You should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as you would in the UK and make sure your accommodation is secure. This also applies if you are staying on a yacht. Be vigilant at all times. Take care when walking alone off the busy main roads and avoid isolated areas, including beaches, particularly after dark.
Only use licensed taxis and take particular care at late night street parties, especially during the festival season.
Don’t carry large amounts of cash or jewellery. If possible, leave valuables and travel documents in a safety deposit box or hotel safe. You should check that the hotel safe is securely fixed before using it to store your items.
Road travel
Driving is on the left. To drive in the country you must get a local temporary driving licence. Car hire companies will usually help with this process. You must present a valid UK driving licence.
Take care when driving on the roads as there are potholes and unmarked speed bumps. Observe the speed limits. You should take extra care on minor roads and in rural areas where there are narrow roads and blind corners. Pedestrians often walk on the roads and indicators are not always used.
Take extra care when driving at night as some roads are unlit. Road signs and hazards may not be easily visible.
Don’t stop if you’re flagged down by pedestrians. Keep car doors locked when driving.
In the event of an accident, call the police and don’t move the vehicle.
Taxis aren’t metered. Standard taxi fares exist for most destinations. Agree the fare in local currency with the driver before you set off. You can often pay in US dollars as well as EC dollars.
Public transport is available and cheaper. Minibus drivers might drive above the speed limit.
Swimming
Beaches in Antigua and Barbuda are open between 5am and 7pm daily. Except on public holidays when they are open between 5am and 1pm. During these hours, picnics, music, drinking alcohol, and parties are prohibited. People visiting the beach must wear masks covering their noses and mouths, and maintain a distance of six feet from other people.
Take great care at all times when swimming as currents can be deceptively strong and not all beaches have lifeguards and/or warning flags. You should monitor all beaches carefully and obey any local warnings.
