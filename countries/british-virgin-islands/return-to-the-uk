Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

British nationals visiting the British Virgin Islands should register with the BVI Tourist Board (+1 284 441 6717). There are no commercial ferries or flights except for private charters departing from the Territory. Borders are closed to all traffic except freight and cargo until 2 June 2020.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
