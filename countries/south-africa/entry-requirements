The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
South Africa has introduced entry restrictions in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, see ‘visas’ section.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to South Africa
International travel has now resumed to and from South Africa. However, anyone travelling to South Africa will be required to produce a paper copy of a negative COVID-19 upon arrival. The test should have been taken no less than 72 hours prior to arrival. We advise that you carry multiple paper copies of your negative COVID-19 test. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You will need to provide proof of accommodation upon arrival in case you need to self-isolate during your trip.
Business travellers providing services across the borders between South Africa and the Southern African Development Community are allowed multiple entry subject to producing a certificate of negative COVID-19 test result not older than 72 hours from the time of departure. This certificate is valid for 14 days.
For any questions regarding the process to enter South Africa, you should speak to your local South African High Commission.
Transiting South Africa
It is possible to transit South Africa and travel to a third country. If you wish to transit through South Africa, you must bring a paper copy of a negative COVID-19 test result. The test should have been taken within 72 hours of your departure. If you cannot produce a negative COVID-19 test then you may be quarantined for 10 days in government-appointed facilities at your own cost.
Screening on arrival
Screening processes have been introduced at all major ports of entry, including airports, for arrivals, departures and transit passengers. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Additional screening may include temperature measurements and check on recent travel to affected areas.
Quarantine requirements
If you fail to produce a paper copy of a negative COVID-19 test you will be required to quarantine at a government-appointed facility at your own cost. Self-isolation is not required if you have provided the negative COVID-19 test.
Data collection
The South African government requires you to complete a health declaration form with your details on arrival, including your address and contact information.
Testing on departure
Screening processes have been introduced at all major ports of entry, including airports, for arrivals, departures and transit passengers. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Screening may include temperature measurements and check on recent travel to affected areas. If you feel unwell, you should not attempt to travel. Presenting at the airport with symptoms may result in you being sent to a government health facility for quarantine and further testing. You should make sure that your insurance will cover unplanned travel disruption due to coronavirus.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 30 days beyond your intended date of exit from South Africa, in line with South African immigration regulations. However, some immigration officials still request that a passport should have at least 6 months validity on the date of entry to South Africa. To avoid problems at the airport on arrival, you’re advised to ensure your passport is valid for six months.
Travelling with children
There are special requirements for travelling to South Africa with children under the age of 18. Parents wishing to apply for a visa for their child to enter South Africa will need to submit additional documentation. There are different requirements for unaccompanied children entering South Africa.
Check the advisory from the South African Department of Home Affairs for more details, and consult your nearest South African high commission or embassy if you have any questions about these requirements.
Residence permits
If you have Permanent Residency in South Africa, you can leave and re-enter South Africa but must carry valid documentation with you proving your permanent residency rights. When re-entering South Africa you will be asked to produce a paper copy of a negative COVID-19 test not older than 72 hours from time of departure to port authorities. Failure to do so will result in you being sent to a government-appointed quarantine facility at your own cost.
Receipts issued by the Department of Home Affairs for applications to renew a permit will not be accepted by the immigration authorities. For more information, contact the South African High Commission or the South African Department of Home Affairs.
Dual citizenship
If you hold South African citizenship, you must enter and exit South Africa on your South African passport. It is an offence for a South African citizen aged 18 or over to enter or leave the country on a foreign passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
South African authorities advise that UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from South Africa.
If you are travelling from a low-risk country and your ETD does not have entry and exit stamps to prove this, you should bear in mind that you may need more evidence to demonstrate your travel history on arrival. You should check the requirements with the nearest South African Embassy, High Commission or Consulate.
ETDs should have a minimum of 6 months validity for entry, transit or exit.
Biometric capturing
South Africa has implemented biometric capturing at all ports of entry. This may result in some delays at land borders. You should allow additional time for border crossings.
