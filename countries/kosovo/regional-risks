Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Kosovo.

This section has safety advice for regions of Kosovo. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.  
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Northern Kosovo
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the municipalities of Zvečan, Zubin Potok and Leposavic, and areas of Mitrovica north of the river Ibar due to violent incidents and heightened tensions in these areas.
Since December 2022 there have been violent clashes and incidents involving grenades and vehicle explosions. Be cautious and avoid public gatherings, particularly around the Austerlitz Bridge area which separates Mitrovica north and south.
Protests have the potential to turn violent. You should:
avoid public gatherings, political rallies and protests
check local media
consult hotel receptions for advice
sign up to get email notifications when this advice is updated
Avoid travelling between Kosovo and Serbia via Gate 1 (Jarinjë, Leposavic) or Gate 31 (Zubin Potok) since these are located in areas of Kosovo where FCDO advises against all but essential travel. You should find alternative routes for travel between Kosovo and Serbia.
Old landmines and unexploded bombs
Residual landmines and other unexploded bombs and weapons remain in Kosovo from the 1999 conflict. Roads and tracks have been cleared.
The main areas of risk are:
along the border with Albania
the Dulje Pass area in central Kosovo
the mountainous region between Kosovo, Albania and Montenegro
Keep to the main roads when travelling in these areas. Most of the remaining dangerous areas are in high mountainous regions covered with dense vegetation. If you see something made of metal or anything suspicious, do not touch it, and report it immediately to the police or the nearest Kosovo Force (KFOR) patrol.
