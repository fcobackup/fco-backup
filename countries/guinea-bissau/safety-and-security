Crime
There have been reports of a rise in crime levels. You should take sensible precautions, and avoid carrying valuables in public.
Local travel
Land mines remain a problem in parts of the country and de-mining operations are continuing. The capital city of Bissau was declared mine-free in June 2006 by the national de-mining centre (CAAMI), which is responsible for de-mining operations and maintains lists of known minefields. Outside of the capital city, you should take local advice and stick to paved roads.

Road travel
Traffic is generally light but road conditions (including in the capital) and driving standards are poor. You should avoid road travel at night and take suitable precautions in the rainy season (June to October) when road and driving conditions can become particularly poor.
Political situation
Guinea-Bissau is a country in which political instability can, and does, occur without warning. The country held the first round of Presidential Elections on 24 November and is scheduled to hold a second round on 29 December. There has been an increase in civil unrest, street demonstrations and large public gatherings ahead of the Presidential elections. In the event of any political unrest you should follow the advice of local authorities.
