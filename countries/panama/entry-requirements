The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the Embassy, High Commission or Consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements. Furthermore, you should consider clarifying whether there are any testing requirements or measures put in place by your airline or countries you are transiting that may affect your travel.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
International flights have resumed to and from Tocumen International Airport.
An electronic affidavit of good health for all travellers entering the country needs to be filled in upon arrival. The affidavit form will be available at the website: https://www.panamadigital.gob.pa/RegistroPacoViajero. The completed affidavit will generate a QR code, which will needs to be scanned on arrival at Tocumen Airport.
Panama encourages the use of the IATA Travel Pass app. This app will have up-to-date information on travel restrictions, authorised labs for COVID-19 tests and vaccine information. It will have the option to enter personal data, such as vaccination information and tests undertaken. The government will accept the “OK to Travel” certification from this app as a validation for COVID-19 tests on travellers.
Entry Restrictions to Panama
From 26 July 2021, vaccination certificates and negative Covid-19 test results need to be uploaded to Panama’s Health Affidavit before arrival. Paper or digital vaccine certificates need to be presented at the airport upon arrival.
All passengers entering from low-risk countries (as those defined by the Ministry of Health) can enter without having to complete a second Covid-19 test upon arrival if they have the following:
• Proof that they are fully vaccinated with the required doses, with the last dose having been received at least 14 days prior to entry
• A negative PCR/antigen test that is valid within 72hours before entering the country.
Travellers entering from high-risk countries (as identified by the Ministry of Health) are required to take a second covid-19 test, at their own cost, upon arrival. If negative, the traveller will not be required to quarantine. If the test is positive, the traveller will be required to quarantine for 14-days at their own cost in a government-managed facility.
The following measures apply for those that are not fully vaccinated:
• A negative PCR/antigen test that is valid within 72hours before entering the country will need to be uploaded on Panama’s Health Affidavit before arrival and presented upon arrival.
Starting Monday 9 August 2021, travellers entering from high-risk countries are required to take a second covid-19 test, at the cost of the passenger, upon arrival. If negative, the traveller will be required to quarantine for 3 days at their own cost at a pre-approved hotel facility at their own expense. The official list can be found on the Visit Panama website.

If you enter Panama by land from Costa Rica, and are not a legal resident of Costa Rica, the immigration authorities may ask you to show proof of onward or return travel to your country of legal residence.
You may be detained by immigration officials if you attempt to renew your tourist visa by visiting a neighbouring country, including Costa Rica. You must follow the relevant rules and procedures when seeking to extend a visa. The British Embassy can’t intervene in decisions made by the immigration authorities. For more information visit the Panama National Migration Service website.
A 180-day tourist visa is stamped on your passport to mark entry to Panama. Extensions are not normally allowed unless you apply to change your immigration status within the 180 days (for business purposes, marriage, etc). For further information on entry requirements, check with the Embassy of the Republic of Panama in London.
When transiting the Panama Canal, if you disembark the ship, your passport will be stamped by the immigration authorities. You do not need a visa unless you are staying in Panama for more than 90 days. Immigration officials do not board transiting cruise ships to check passports.
If you arrive in Panama by sea, except via a cruise line, you will need a visa. There is a fee of USD 100 plus USD 5 registration per person for passengers and crew members of vessels.
