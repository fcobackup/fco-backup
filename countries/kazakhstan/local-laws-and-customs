Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Ministerâ€™s statement for the latest information.

Kazakhstan has a secular constitution. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend other cultures or religious beliefs.
Possession and use of drugs is illegal; if found guilty, you could face a lengthy prison sentence in basic conditions.
Although homosexuality is not illegal, it is often not tolerated, especially outside the major cities. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
You must carry your passport at all times (not a photocopy).
There are restrictions on photography near military establishments, border areas and some official buildings. Notices about these restrictions are not always indicated. Photographing airport facilities is prohibited. Many of the larger shops and supermarkets also prohibit photography.
You can import a drone into Kazakhstan at airports or land border crossings without a licence. However, unlicensed use of drones in Kazakhstan will attract a fine, detention and confiscation of equipment. You can get a licence to use a drone from the Aviation Committee in Nur-Sultan. Applications for licences should include technical characteristics of the drone and details of planned use (when, where, how long). You can find more information about licensing requirements on the Zakon.kz website (information portal of the Republic of Kazakhstan) (only in Russian).
