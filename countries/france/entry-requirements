The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
On 8 April, French authorities introduced a requirement to complete a certificate for International travel from abroad to mainland France in order to enter France. This certificate should be completed before entering France, in order to be shown to French border authorities on entry and, where appropriate, transportation companies prior to boarding. If you do not complete the certificate, you may be unable to complete your journey. You can produce a handwritten copy of the text in the attestation if you are unable to access a printer.
In order to travel within or to transit through France, you should either complete an Attestation de déplacement dérogatoire to certify your reason for travel or an “Attestation déplacement professionnel”, if travelling for essential professional reasons. This “attestation” (declaration) should be completed before starting your journey, and, if entering France, does not replace the requirement for an “International travel from abroad to mainland France” certificate. You can produce a handwritten copy of the text in the attestation if you are unable to access a printer. Further information, including links to both these documents, is available on the Ministry of Interior webpage.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter France. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in France guide and contact the French Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Travelling with children
From 15 January 2017, any child (under the age of 18) who is (a) living in France and (b) leaving France unaccompanied by a parent or guardian, must present the following documents on departure at the French border: (i) the child’s own ID card or passport, (ii) a completed AST authorisation form signed by a parent/guardian (Authorisation de Sortie du Territoire) and (iii) a copy of the ID card or passport of the parent or guardian who has signed the AST form. For more information visit the French Ministry of Interior website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from France.
