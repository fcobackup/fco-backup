Coronavirus travel health
Ghana has removed COVID-19 travel restrictions for all arriving passengers in Ghana, however protocols at the airport may be subject to change. Travellers should, therefore, be prepared to provide evidence of COVID-19 vaccination on arrival. Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Ghana on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Kotoka International Airport is open. Commercial flights are operating to and from Ghana. Check with your travel company for the latest information. Land and sea borders have now re-opened.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Ghana.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Most medicines that need a prescription from a doctor in the UK will need one in Ghana. Bring sufficient stocks of prescribed medicines with you. If you have to get a prescription whilst in Ghana you will need an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner – UK prescriptions are normally accepted. Unlike in the UK, you will need to go to a pharmacy to obtain most over-the-counter medicines. Only a very limited selection are available at supermarkets or other stores and you may be offered another brand or a similar generic medicine as an alternative. Where possible, purchase known brands or medicines with a Ghana Food and Drug Administration registration number stamped on the packet. Pharmacies are widely available and are usually identified by a green cross.
