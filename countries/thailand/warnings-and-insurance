Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Thailand.

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).
Areas where FCDO advises against all but essential travel
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of the south, near the Thailand-Malaysia border:
Pattani Province
Yala Province
Narathiwat Province
southern Songkhla Province – south of the A43 road between Hat Yai and Sakom, and south of the train line which runs between Hat Yai and Padang Besar
FCDO also advises against all but essential travel on the Hat Yai to Padang Besar train line that runs through these provinces.
This is due to regular attacks in the provinces by the border with Malaysia. See Safety and security .
