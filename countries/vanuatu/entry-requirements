The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Border protection measures
With effect from 31 January 2020, the Government of Vanuatu has introduced additional border protection and disease surveillance measures in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Travellers must complete a health declaration form on entry. Those who have been in or transited through any part of China, Taiwan, Macau or Hong Kong, up to 14 days prior to their intended date of travel to Vanuatu, will be denied entry. An exception is in place for Returning Residents who travel to Vanuatu via Hong Kong, who can do so as long as they have not been in mainland China within 2 months and remain airside, with a connection time of 8 hours or less.
The Government of Vanuatu has also issued specific instructions to crew on aircraft and foreign going sea vessels. Given the fast moving situation, you should familiarise yourself with controls in place and to check with your airline before you travel.
Visas

Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry to Vanuatu.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
