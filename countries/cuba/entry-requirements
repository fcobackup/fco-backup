Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Cuba
Everyone has to complete a Health Declaration (with the address of where they will be staying) and have a PCR test. From 1 December, all air tickets will have a sanitary fee of $30 included. If you have to pay for a PCR test, e.g. arriving by boat, the cost is payable by credit card, or in USD or GBP or Euros cash. The test result should be communicated within 48 hours. Travel insurance with cover for COVID-19 is required.
Screening and quarantine
Tourists arriving on holiday charter flights will be transferred to their hotels, and will be briefed on further medical checks or testing at the hotel.
Independent travellers will have to self-isolate if they are staying in private accommodation and have a further PCR test on their fifth day. On receipt of a second, negative PCR test result, you will no longer have to self-isolate. Anyone going to a hotel from the airport will follow the guidance of the medical staff at the hotel.
Anyone with a positive PCR test result must to go to hospital. The costs of the stay in hospital (and any medication) must be paid by credit card when discharged, or payment will need to be arranged directly by your travel insurance company.

Travelling to Cuba from the USA
Travelling for tourism reasons directly from the USA to Cuba isn’t allowed under US law. The law applies to US nationals and all foreign nationals who are either resident in the USA, or travelling through the USA en route to Cuba. Those travelling on direct flights between the UK and Cuba, or via other countries excluding the USA, are unaffected by this US legislation.
Under certain conditions, travel is permitted from the USA to Cuba, including on the direct flights which operate between the two countries. Everybody travelling on these routes (both US citizens and foreign nationals) will need to comply with US law and travel for one of 12 permitted reasons/categories of travel. Tourism isn’t one of these 12 permitted reasons/categories. For more information see the US Department of the Treasury website and the US State Department’s travel advice for Cuba. For travel-specific questions, see the Code of Federal Regulations 31 C.F.R. 515.560 and the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) frequently asked questions.
