Crime
Crime levels are low across Japan, but you should maintain the same level of vigilance as you would at home and take sensible precautions.
While it is generally safe to walk about at night and to travel on public transport, there have been a number of random attacks recently targeting multiple victims, including on the Tokyo metro. Numbers of such incidents remain comparatively extremely low. However, it is advised that you familiarise yourself with the Run Hide Tell guidance, which sets out the steps to take to keep yourself safe.
Attacks on individuals, including sexual assault and rape, are rare, but do happen. Japanese law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that the sexual relations were not consensual and committed through assault, intimidation or force. Reports of inappropriate touching of female passengers on commuter trains are fairly common. The police advise that you shout at the perpetrator to attract attention and ask a fellow passenger to call the train staff.
If your passport is lost or stolen, you should report this at a police station and get a police report.
Tokyo’s entertainment districts are considered higher risk areas for crime, in particular at night. Foreign nationals have been targeted for extortion, robbery, assault and sexual assault in clubs and bars. There have also been reports of drink spiking and credit card fraud, often in combination: victims have described waking up with no memory of the preceding hours to discover that large amounts have been billed to their card. Getting a police report, which may be required by credit card companies in order for any claim to be processed, can be very difficult in these circumstances. You should take steps to ensure that your drinks can’t be tampered with: be wary of accepting drinks from strangers, and always have a trusted friend to keep an eye on any unfinished drink.
British nationals have been arrested following disputes with bar staff and doormen, including for refusing to pay exorbitant bar bills.
Prostitution and street touts are illegal but commonplace. Don’t accompany touts to bars and clubs under any circumstances. To encourage people into establishments, touts commonly misrepresent the services on offer, and/or wrongly suggest clients are free to walk away on arrival if they don’t wish to proceed.
Emergency services
In cases of emergency, dial 110 for the police and 119 for the fire or ambulance services.  Calls are free of charge from any phone, including pay phones. Hospitals may want to confirm you have insurance or means of payment before accepting you as a patient.
Fukushima
There are some exclusion zones around the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, which are clearly identified by the Japanese authorities. These exclusion zones are kept under review and have reduced in area over the past several years. Areas where evacuation orders are ready to be lifted are still subject to some restrictions - for instance visitors aren’t allowed to stay overnight. Follow local guidance.
The exclusion zone around the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant has been designated a restricted area.
The Japanese authorities carry out comprehensive checks to monitor radiation in the area surrounding Fukushima Daiichi and to monitor possible contamination of water, food and produce. They impose strict controls where necessary. Any significant change in the current situation will be reported on this page.
Although the the decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi site and full clean-up of the surrounding area will take many years, the risks are gradually declining.
Road travel
To drive in Japan, you must hold an International Driving Permit (IDP), a current UK licence and insurance. An IDP is only valid for use in Japan for one year regardless of its date of expiry. Check the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department website for further details. You must carry your driving licence with you at all times. Penalties for driving in Japan without the correct documents are severe.
If you intend to stay in Japan for longer than one year, you should apply for a Japanese driving licence. For more information and details of offices where you can apply for a Japanese licence, visit the Japanese Automobile Federation website
There are two types of driving insurance available in Japan: compulsory insurance (jibaisekihoken) and voluntary insurance (nin’i no jidoshahoken). The compulsory insurance on its own may be insufficient in cases of personal liability.
Roads are well maintained. Driving is on the left, as in the UK. Road rules are mostly the same as in the UK, but drivers should pay particular attention to: pedestrians crossing roads at green lights, especially at junctions; cyclists travelling on the pavements or on the wrong side of the road and without lights at night; and taxi drivers stopping suddenly.
There are severe penalties to deter drink driving, including allowing someone else to drink and drive (for example if you are a passenger in a vehicle being driven by a drunk driver). Legal limits are lower than they are in the UK and offences can attract a heavy fine or imprisonment. 
In 2019 there were 3,920 road deaths in Japan (source: Department for Transport). This equates to 3.1 road deaths per 100,000 of population of population and compares to the UK average of 2.6 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2019.
Political situation
Japan is a stable democracy. Civil disturbances and violent demonstrations are rare. Occasionally, demonstrations of a pro-nationalist kind can involve hostility to foreign countries. Keep yourself informed of developments and if you become aware of any protests, leave the area immediately.
Mobile phone networks
Only 3G and 4G capable UK handsets will work in Japan. GSM-only UK phones don’t work, as there’s no GSM network. If you plan to make lots of calls or use mobile data in Japan, SIM cards are available to hire online or in-store. WiFi zones are also increasingly available in coffee shops, hotels and other public spaces.
