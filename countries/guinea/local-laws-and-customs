Don’t become involved with drugs of any kind.
Those who commit criminal offences, including gem smuggling, can expect to be subjected to local law. There are heavy penalties for those convicted. Local prison conditions are harsh with food and water often not supplied on a regular basis. Pre-trial detention is extensive and can last for many months.
All precious stones require an export licence.
Foreigners and Guinean nationals are required to show identification if asked by the police or other law enforcement agencies. You are allowed to carry photocopies of the relevant pages of your passport, provided they are certified by the Guinean police. Keep the original in a safe place.
Although homosexuality is not explicitly mentioned in the Guinean Penal Code, Article 325 of the Code states that ‘indecent acts and acts against nature committed with an individual of the same sex will be punished by imprisonment of six months to three years and a fine of 100,000 to 1,000,000 Guinean francs. If the act is with a minor of less than 21 years, the maximum sentence will be pronounced. If the act is committed with violence or attempted violence the sentence will be 5-10 years’. We have no reports of any attacks on persons linked to their sexuality. However, homosexuality is not widely accepted or understood. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Photography and filming in many parts of the country is forbidden or subject to strict rules which are enforced rigidly. It is forbidden to photograph or film anything of strategic value e.g. bridges. Do not photograph military or police installations or government buildings. Individuals may prefer not to be photographed. If in doubt, seek permission or do not take pictures.
