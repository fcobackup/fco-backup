The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
South Africa has implemented biometric capturing at all ports of entry. This may result in some delays at land borders. You should allow additional time for border crossings.
The South African authorities have announced a travel ban for visitors from various countries affected by coronavirus, including the United Kingdom.
Passport validity
Technically, your passport should be valid for at least 30 days beyond your intended date of exit from South Africa, in line with South African immigration regulations. However, some immigration officials still request that a passport should have at least 6 months validity on the date of entry to South Africa. To avoid problems at the airport on arrival, you’re advised to ensure your passport meets this requirement.
Your passport should have at least 2 blank pages if you require a visa to enter the country. If you do not need a visa, one blank page will be sufficient.
Visas
If you are visiting South Africa for tourism or business purposes for a period of up to 90 days, you don’t need a visa.
If you overstay, you are likely to be declared undesirable and denied entry into South Africa in future. The enforcement of these penalties is strict, and appeals can take many months to process.
For more information on visas contact the South African High Commission or the South African Department of Home Affairs.
Dual citizenship
If you hold South African citizenship, you must enter and exit South Africa on your South African passport. It is an offence for a South African citizen aged 18 or over to enter or leave the country on a foreign passport.
Travelling with children (under 18)
South Africa has relaxed its requirements for travelling with children under the age of 18. Visa exempt children (including UK Nationals visiting for tourism purposes) entering South Africa accompanied by an adult are required to present only a valid passport on arrival, regardless of whether the child is travelling with both parents, one parent, or an adult who is not a biological parent (for more information, please see the Immigration Act in conjunction with this advisory from the South African Department of Home Affairs). This includes children travelling as part of school groups.
There are different requirements for unaccompanied children entering South Africa. These are set out in this advisory from the South African Department of Home Affairs. If you have specific questions about these requirements, please consult your nearest South African High Commission or Embassy.
Contact your nearest South African High Commission or Embassy if you have any specific questions about your trip.
You can order a full unabridged birth certificate online via GOV.UK if your child was born in the UK, or the South African Department of Home Affairs website if your child was born in South Africa.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
South African authorities advise that UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are usually accepted for entry, transit and exit from South Africa. ETDs should have a minimum of 6 months validity. If you’re planning to enter the country on an ETD, you must check requirements with the nearest South African Embassy, High Commission or Consulate before confirming your travel plans.
Residence permits
If you live in South Africa, you must have valid residence permit in your passport when entering and leaving the country. Receipts issued by the Department of Home Affairs for applications to renew a permit will not be accepted by the immigration authorities. For more information, contact the South African High Commission or the South African Department of Home Affairs.
