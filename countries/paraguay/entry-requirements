Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Visitors who have been in the UK since 7 December
The Paraguayan government has announced that from Monday 21 December, non-resident foreign nationals that have been in the United Kingdom since 7 December will not be allowed entry to Paraguay. This restriction will be in place until 4 January 2021.
Entry for Paraguayans and resident foreign nationals that have visited the UK since 7 December is subject to exceptional authorisation of the Paraguayan government, with a negative PCR test result with 72 hours of arrival and complete a mandatory 10 day quarantine in a ‘health hotel’ or government provided accommodation.
In order to contact the Paraguayan government for entry authorisation or to access the government shelters, contact the Interinstitutional Coordination Centre (CCI-CODENA) via email: codenapy6@outlook.com or ringing +595 21 212 099, +595 21 213 034, +595 21 202 131. Visitors to Paraguay who arrived between 14 and 21 December, should isolate at home for 7 days from their arrival date.
Visitors who have not been in the UK since 7 December 2020
Non-resident foreign nationals who have not visited the UK in the previous 7 days may enter Paraguay. Those who arrive with a negative PCR test result issued 72 hours before entering the country will not require isolation, however those without a test result should isolate for 14 days.
Entry to Paraguay
Entry by air
People wishing to enter the country (nationals, foreign residents and non-residents) must complete mandatory quarantine at their home for 14 days.
Government shelters and health hotels remain available for those who do not wish to or are unable to isolate at their home. To access the government shelters, contact the Interinstitutional Coordination Centre (CCI-CODENA) via email: codenapy6@outlook.com or ringing +595 21 212 099, +595 21 213 034, +595 21 202 131.
The quarantine time may be reduced to seven days if the person performs the test (RT-PCR) with a negative result 72 hours before entering the country and repeats the same test with a negative result on the 7th day of the quarantine.
People who enter the country for a duration less than 7 days (with a valid return ticket) will not require isolation but must show a negative result 72 hours before entering the country.
All people entering the country must comply with the sanitary measures imposed by the Ministry of Health, such as physical distancing, use of facemasks and frequent hand washing.
Non-resident foreigners must present international medical insurance with complete health coverage to include attention to COVID-19 cases, RT-PCR tests, laboratory studies, outpatient care, hospitalisation, and stays in the ICU.
All travellers must complete the health card at the time of entering the country at the immigration check or 24 hours before their trip informing the Paraguayan Ministry of Health of any potential issues or exposure.
Entry by land
The following information applies only to visitors who have not been in the UK since 7 December 2020.
The Paraguayan government has opened its land borders with Brazil, under a special regime. The cities of Ciudad del Este (border with Foz de Iguazu), Pedro Juan Caballero (border with Ponta Pora), and Salto del Guairá (border with Mundo Novo), are open for people to carry out its activities within a 30-kilometer perimeter of the aforementioned border crossings with Brazil.
People who enter Paraguay on this regime must leave the country within 24 hours and admission will require mandatory use of a facemask.
The entry hours established for this regime are:
International Friendship Bridge (Ciudad del Este – Foz de Iguazu): From 5:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. (after that time, the bridge will close for entry to Paraguay).
Pedro Juan Caballero: From 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
Salto del Guairá: From 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
Visas
From 2 November, tourists and non-resident foreigners who are still within Paraguayan national territory and whose period of lawful stay in the country has expired, must pay the corresponding penalty (Gs. 253,050) when registering their departure at the border post or airport immigration control or when approaching the offices of the Direccion General de Migraciones.
Likewise, foreign citizens whose temporary residence has expired must approach the Direccion General de Migraciones to obtain a new residence card, pay the corresponding penalty in case of being in breach and update their immigration status.
If you are in Paraguay and your period of lawful stay has expired, contact the Direccion General de Migraciones for further information.
You can find more information on the Paraguayan Dirección General de Migraciones website (in Spanish).
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Passport holders do not need a visa to enter Paraguay. On presentation of a valid British passport you will normally be granted a 90-day stay in the country.
You must make sure on arrival that your passport is stamped by an immigration official, dated and signed. Anybody without an entry stamp in their passport will be fined when they leave the country. This is particularly important for anyone entering Paraguay at a land border, typically the crossing between Ciudad del Este and Foz de Iguazu (Brazil). Sometimes long distance bus drivers tell foreign nationals that they can complete immigration formalities in Asunción. This is not true, and visitors will incur a fine if they do not get their passport stamped at the point of entry.
If you wish to extend your stay for another 90-day period, seek advice from the Direccion General de Migraciones.
If you are travelling to Paraguay to work or study you should contact the Paraguayan Embassy in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
Travelling with children
If you’re under 18, travelling across borders in the region without one or both parents, it’s advisable to have written permission to travel from both parents, duly certified by the Paraguayan Embassy in London, or your nearest Paraguayan Embassy. Single parents or other adults travelling alone with children should be aware that immigration officers often request documentary evidence of parental responsibility before allowing lone parents to enter the country or, in some cases, before permitting the children to leave the country. For more information on this contact the Paraguayan Embassy in London.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Paraguay. The validity requirements are the same as for full validity British passports. If you plan to travel to Argentina or the US you will need a visa in your ETD. You must contact the nearest Embassies of those countries in order to apply.
Be aware that the British Embassy in Asunción does not produce ETDs. In case you require an ETD it will be done so through the British Embassy in Buenos Aires.
