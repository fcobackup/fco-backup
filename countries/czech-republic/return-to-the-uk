There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from the Czech Republic. From Saturday 14 March, cross-border bus, train and ferry services are suspended and, although Prague airport remains open, there are limited flight options available.
Flights
International air travel is now limited to Prague Airport, which remains open, but few flights are operating. There are currently no direct flights between Prague and the UK, and indirect flights are limited and expensive, and subject to last-minute cancellations. You should check with your carrier before travelling to Prague Airport to see if your flight is affected. If you are currently in the Czech Republic and want to leave the country, you should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible to ensure departure.
Road
There are a limited number of coaches which are taking passengers periodically from Prague to London until 15 April. The journey takes roughly 17 hours and costs CZK1,950, which must be paid in cash to the driver. The British Embassy will need to secure your seat on these coaches in advance; if you would like to reserve a place on one of these coaches, please contact the British Embassy in Prague on +420 257 402 111 and request consular assistance. Please be aware that these journeys are not operated by the British Government and any journey is undertaken at your own risk.
You are able to drive back to the UK from the Czech Republic. Road travel into neighbouring countries is currently restricted to the 11 designated border crossings listed on the Ministry of Interior’s website. Please check the travel advice in other countries along your route before you make the journey; many countries are asking to see proof of onward travel such a ferry ticket, or in the case of Austria, a certificate proving you are healthy.
The government has confirmed that foreign tourists already in the Czech Republic will be able to return home.
