Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Indonesia
Indonesia is in the process of implementing a series of changes to admission for foreign nationals in response to the discovery of the new variant Covid strain. While these are being rolled out, in addition to meeting the categories below, you should reconfirm your eligibility to enter Indonesia with your travel agent/airline and the Indonesian Embassy. This can be done by contacting the Consular Section of the Indonesian Embassy on: consular@indonesianembassy.org.uk.
From 1 January 2021 until 25 January 2021, all non-Indonesian travellers are prohibited from entering Indonesia, although there are exceptions to this ban - including for those with KITAS/KITAP.
If you are a British national, starting your journey from the UK or from another country, you may be able to enter Indonesia between 1 January 2021 and 25 January 2021 if you meet one of the following 4 exceptions to the ban:
Holders of diplomatic and official/service visa for the purpose of a ministerial official visit.
Holders of diplomatic and official/service stay permit.
Holders of Indonesia Temporary Residence Card (KITAS) and Indonesia Permanent Residence Card (KITAP).
Foreign nationals due to special discretion and provided with written permission from relevant ministries/government institutions.
Entry requirements if you meet the above criteria are:
You must be in possession of a health certificate confirming a negative COVID-19 PCR test (swab test) result. From 1 January, your certificate must be issued a maximum of 72 hours prior to your departure for Indonesia. The certificate must be in English.
You will need to undergo a further COVID-19 swab test on arrival and then quarantine at your own expense in a designated hotel for a period of 5 days. After 5 days you will undertake a third PCR test. If this is negative, you will be allowed to proceed with your journey. If the test is positive, you will be referred to hospital.
You are required to complete the Indonesian eHAC registration and be able to produce the QR code generated on arrival in Indonesia for inspection.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Health certificate
All visitors will also need to present your health certificate showing a negative COVID-19 PCR test result as stipulated above at check-in ahead of any scheduled travel. Failure to present a health certificate may result in your being prevented from boarding the plane, or denied entry or transit in Indonesia. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
On arrival at Indonesian airports, all visitors must also complete and submit a Health Alert certificate to the Health Quarantine Office.
More information is available regarding coronavirus in Indonesia via the Ministry of Health.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
In normal circumstances, if you’re travelling on a British Citizen passport you do not need a visa to enter Indonesia for visits of up to 30 days, calculated to include your date of arrival and date of departure. Visa-free visits can not be extended or transferred to another type of visa. For a list of airports, seaports and land border crossings for entering/exiting Indonesia under this visa waiver scheme, and more information about entry requirements, visit the Indonesian Embassy in London website or your nearest Indonesian embassy.
If you’re travelling to Indonesia and intend to stay for more than 30 days (up to a maximum of 60 days), you should apply for a visa before you travel, or apply for a visa on arrival at a cost of US$35, or the equivalent in Indonesian rupiah, at the visa on arrival desk within the airport. These types of visa are valid for 30 days, and can be extended once (for a maximum of 30 days) by making an application for an extension to an immigration office within Indonesia. Ensure that you extend your visa within the initial 30 days to avoid an overstay fine.
The Indonesian embassy has introduced a new e-visa system. You should submit your visa application online. The embassy will no longer accept a handwritten visa application form unless you’re a British Overseas Territories citizen, British National (Overseas), or if you’re applying for a diplomatic visa. If you fall into this category you should send a written request to obtain the visa form at: consular@indonesianembassy.org.
The visa waiver scheme and visas on arrival aren’t available if you’re travelling on a British Overseas Citizen, British Subject, British National (Overseas) or British Overseas Territory citizen passport. Instead, you must apply for a visa before you travel.
These options are also not available if you’re travelling to Indonesia for journalistic purposes. Instead, you must apply for a visa before you travel, and should make sure that you have the correct permits for local travel within Indonesia as some areas may need special permits in addition to your visa. You should seek advice from your nearest Indonesian Embassy.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of your departure from Indonesia.
Indonesian law doesn’t allow dual nationality for adults over 18 years of age. If you’re a British national who has retained Indonesian nationality, you may experience immigration difficulties in Indonesia.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for airside transit and exit from Indonesia. ETDs may also be accepted for entry into Indonesia. If you’re entering Indonesia using an ETD you must apply for a visit visa before travelling. You won’t be able to get a visa on arrival. The processing time for an Indonesian visa can vary depending on where you apply. Some Indonesian embassies do not issue Indonesian visas in ETDs. Contact your nearest Indonesian Embassy to check before you apply.
Entry requirements may differ if you live in Indonesia. Contact your nearest Indonesian Embassy to confirm whether you need to apply for a visit visa before you travel to Indonesia using an ETD.
If you apply for an ETD whilst in Indonesia, you may need to get an exit permit from Immigration to leave the country. We will advise you to contact the nearest Immigration office to check before travelling.
Proof of onward travel
Immigration officials in Indonesia may ask you for proof of onward travel (such as a return or onward air ticket). You should make all reservations before leaving for Indonesia. Some airlines have refused to board passengers without evidence of onward travel.
Departure and airport tax
Airport tax is included in the cost your ticket for all domestic flights within Indonesia. For some international flights departing Indonesia, airport tax may not be included in the price of the ticket. You should check with your airline or travel agent before you travel.
Overstaying your visa
Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter and visitors can be held in detention or refused permission to leave the country until a fine of Rp 1 million per day is paid. After overstaying for 60 days, you will be detained and possibly imprisoned.
Registering
If you stay in private accommodation in Indonesia (not a hotel) you must register your presence with the local police or you could face a fine of Rp 5 million. If you stay in a hotel you will be registered automatically.
Travelling with medication
If you bring any prescription medication into Indonesia, make sure you have a copy of the prescription with you. The prescription must cover the quantity of medication you bring. Be aware that some prescription or other medication available in the UK, including some psychotropic medicines, may be illegal in Indonesia. If you’re unsure, speak to your doctor and the Indonesian Embassy for advice before you travel.
