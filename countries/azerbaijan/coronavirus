Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Healthcare in Azerbaijan
A number of medical facilities are allocated specifically for coronavirus patients. Previously everyone infected had been hospitalised as a precautionary measure. This is no longer the case and only those with the most serious symptoms are usually taken to hospital, with many given the option to self-isolate or be treated at home. However, this will depend on individual circumstances. If you think you might have symptoms of coronavirus you should call 103 or 804.
