The Malawian authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
The Ministry of Health is now screening all travellers on arrival. Individuals showing with symptoms of coronavirus may be moved into a treatment facility. Self- isolation for 14 days will be mandatory for all those travelling: (a) from the UK; (b) from the European Union; (c) from the SADC region, where that country has confirmed local transmission of coronavirus; (d) from other countries with more than 700 cases; or (e) from countries with more than 100 new cases reported in 24 hours.
Visitors from high-risk countries for coronavirus, including the United Kingdom, are no longer permitted to enter Malawi unless they have a residence permit.

Many visitors from the UK travel to Malawi via Kenya or South Africa. Both countries have put in place travel restrictions on individuals from countries affected by coronavirus (COVID-19), including the United Kingdom. Follow our travel advice for Kenya or South Africa if this applies to you.
As governments and local authorities bring in measures to control the spread of the virus, a number of airlines are reducing their inward and outward flight schedules. You should urgently contact your airline if you are due to travel to or from Malawi.
