The UK does not recognise Taiwan as a state and has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan, so limited consular services are available to British nationals. Please refer to the British Office in Taipei for further information.
Satellite Launch
On Tuesday 9 January 2024 at 1520 local time, all mobile phones in Taiwan received a Presidential Alert in Mandarin and English. The English language version alerted to a “missile flyover”. The Ministry of National Defence have clarified that this alert was issued in connection with a satellite launched over Taiwanese airspace with a risk of falling debris. Reference to a missile was a mistranslation.
