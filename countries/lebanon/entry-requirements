This page has information on travelling to Lebanon. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Lebanon set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
British citizens can normally apply for a free single entry tourist or family visit visa on arrival.
British Overseas Citizens and British Protected Persons will need to get a visa before travelling to Lebanon.
Persons of Palestinian origin may also require a visa before travelling, or may be required to carry additional documentation with them when travelling.
All passengers arriving in Lebanon must register on the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) platform to obtain a MOPH pass (children under the age of 12 and members of the UNIFIL peacekeeping mission are exempt).
To obtain a MOPH pass, all passengers (apart from children under the age of 12 and members of the UNIFIL peacekeeping mission) must pay $30 in advance through one of two options:
by a credit card through the MOPH platform;
by Electronic Miscellaneous Document (EMD) at an IATA Travel and Tourism Agency or at the airline’s sales office. Passengers will receive an EMD which should be produced to MOPH officials on arrival
All passengers, regardless of vaccination status, will be required to take a PCR test at Beirut International Airport on arrival (the cost is covered under your MOPH pass). Exemptions apply to children under the age of 12, members of the UNIFIL peacekeeping mission, and cabin crew arriving for a period of less than 48 hours and who will remain in self-isolation.
All passengers, regardless of vaccination status, should remain in self-isolation until they receive their test result. It currently takes around 48 hours to get results. If the result is negative, you will be released from self-isolation. If the result is positive, you must immediately call the COVID-19 hotline on 1787 (from a local number) unless contacted by the MoPH.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Passengers are considered fully vaccinated if they have received the second or third dose of any COVID-19 vaccine (or single dose for vaccinations comprising of one dose only) within the past six months.
If you’re fully vaccinated, you will be exempt from performing a pre-departure PCR or Rapid Antigen test. Proof of vaccination should be uploaded to the MOPH website to obtain the MOPH pass.
Passengers who can prove that they have travelled out of Lebanon and returned within one week are exempt from taking a pre-departure PCR or Rapid Antigen (Lateral Flow) test, provided they upload certificates and official documentation to the MOPH website to obtain a MOPH pass.
Proof of vaccination status
Lebanon doesn’t accept proof of recovery/vaccination record. Your final vaccine has to have been administered no more than six months before travel to Lebanon.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative PCR test taken no more than 48 hours before boarding your flight, or a Rapid Antigen (Lateral Flow) test taken no more than 24 hours before boarding. See information on getting a test before entry.
You should upload the result of your PCR or Rapid Antigen test to the MOPH platform, which will generate a unique QR code that will be sent via text message. The QR code will be checked on arrival at Beirut airport.
Children and young people
Children aged 11 and under are exempt from registering on the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) platform, do not need to take a pre-departure test and will not be required to take a PCR test on arrival.
If you’re transiting through Lebanon
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
You should contact your airline for guidance on vaccination and testing requirements if you plan to transit through Lebanon.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of entry into Lebanon.
If your passport is lost or stolen during your stay in Lebanon and you require an ETD to leave, you will need to visit the Public Prosecution in Adlieh building (central Beirut) to report the loss or theft. Once the police report is finalized, you will need to obtain an Exit visa prior to your departure in order to leave the country, either from the General Security’s Department of Passport and Immigration or from the General Security Office at the airport. You will need to show the police report and the ETD. You should factor the time this will take into any new travel plans.
If your passport contains an Israeli stamp you may be refused entry to Lebanon even if you hold a valid Lebanese visa.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British citizens can normally apply for a free single entry tourist or family visit visa on arrival. British Overseas Citizens and British Protected Persons will need to get a visa before travelling to Lebanon. Persons of Palestinian origin may also require a visa before travelling, or may be required to carry additional documentation with them when travelling. Entry requirements are subject to change, so you should check with the Lebanese Embassy before you travel.
Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter. You may be refused permission to leave until a fine has been paid.
Previous travel to Israel
If your passport contains an Israeli stamp you may be refused entry to Lebanon even if you hold a valid Lebanese visa. If you are visiting Lebanon, your passport should be valid for a minimum of 3 months from the date you arrive.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Lebanon. You can find more information on how to get an ETD on gov.uk.
Stop matches
Lebanese Immigration Authorities check all visitors’ names on arrival against a database of those wanted for, or convicted of, offences in Lebanon. If a name matches against an entry on the database the individual may be detained (or on occasion allowed entry upon surrender of their passport) until they can prove that the record does not relate to them. It’s often possible to do so by producing a copy of a birth certificate or other official documentation that allows parents’ names to be checked against the database. You should consider carrying this kind of supporting documentation.
