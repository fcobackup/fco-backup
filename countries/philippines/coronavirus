Travel in the Philippines
Measures have been introduced by the Philippine government to prevent the spread of coronavirus; these differ across the country. The quarantine level in the National Capital Region (Metro Manila), Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna and Rizal is Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ) and is in effect until (at least) 14 May. An evening curfew in the capital region from 10pm until 4am will also be in force over the same period. British nationals should continue to follow the advice of local authorities. The Philippine Inter-Agency Task Force (for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases) has announced that during MECQ: Food preparation establishments such as commissaries, restaurants and eateries may resume their indoor dine-in services at 10% capacity; and
Beauty salons, beauty parlours, barbershops and nail spas may resume services at 30% capacity providing patrons/clients and service providers wear facemasks at all time.
The following areas have been placed under General Community Quarantine from 1 May:
CAR: Apayao, Baguio City, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga, Mountain Province
Region 2: Cagayan, Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya
Region 4-A: Batangas, Quezon
Region 8: Tacloban City
Region 10: Iligan City

The wearing of face shields while on public and private transport is now mandatory. This includes but is not limited to trains, buses, jeepneys, taxis, boats and ships. The order also includes aeroplanes. You should check with your airline in advance whether they will provide a shield or whether you need to bring your own.
You should closely monitor announcements from local authorities to understand the latest restrictions and regulations where you’re situated, and their impact on your ability to travel and access essential services. Check the requirements of your local authority such as barangay clearance, health certificate or travel authority for any travel outside of your residence, including to the airport. For further information on rules and restrictions relating to quarantine classifications, visit the Department for Health website.
Travel to the airport
Since November 2020, some airports including Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) have required passengers to download the ‘Traze Contact Tracing’ app prior to entry. You can find further information on the NAIA facebook page.
If you plan to take a commercial flight but are experiencing difficulty travelling to the airport due to community quarantine restrictions, the British Embassy can provide a letter to facilitate your passage through checkpoints. You can submit your request to our Consular team via the web contact form. You can also seek assistance from your local Department of Tourism office, which may be able to offer advice on transport options or hotels.
The Philippine government has confirmed that foreign nationals will be able to leave the Philippines at any time during the period of enhanced quarantine. See Entry requirements.
There is disruption to travel routes both domestically and across the region. Check with your travel provider for updates.
