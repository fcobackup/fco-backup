International travel
Commercial flights to and from Vietnam remain limited. A number of airline websites allow online booking from Vietnam. However, check carefully in advance whether these flights are guaranteed to fly and whether they are passenger flights.
Flights and transit arrangements are still prone to changes and cancellation with little notice.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Vietnam.
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport and/or rule changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover, including COVID testing and treatment
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Domestic travel
Air Travel
COVID-19 prevention measures vary depending on where you start your journey and your destination. You should check with your travel provider on the status of your flight and prevention measures in place at your destination and/or on return, before travelling.
Public spaces and services
The measures to combat COVID-19 vary from province to province and can change at short notice. Social distancing rules remain in place in many places across Vietnam and you should follow these strictly. Mask wearing is compulsory in public settings. Those not wearing masks may be liable to spot fines.

Testing and self-isolation/quarantine
If you are asked to undertake testing, you should comply. Failure to comply can be an offence with significant punishments.
Self-isolation periods and testing requirements can change at short notice and may vary between locations.
If you test positive with COVID-19 you may have to self-isolate for 7 days. Most provinces permit self-isolation at your place of residence if it meets the requirements of local authorities, but you may be required to self-isolate in a designated quarantine centre or hotel.
