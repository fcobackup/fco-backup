Entry and borders
The Philippine Bureau of Immigration is restricting the entry of foreign nationals to the Philippines in response to the coronavirus outbreak. British nationals will no longer be able to receive a visa on arrival and will not be able to enter the Philippines until further notice. Foreign spouses and children travelling with a Filipino national and members of international organisations already accredited to the Philippines will be exempt from this restriction. See Return to the UK for advice about returning to the UK from the Philippines.
Social measures
The Philippine government has declared a public health emergency following the emergence of local transmission of COVID-19. On 12 March, the Philippine government announced Code Red Sublevel 2 in response to COVID-19. This imposes restrictions including social distancing requirements across Metro Manila. From 15th March travel to and from Metro Manila will be restricted for a period of 30 days.
Many local government units (including in Metro Manila) have announced overnight curfews (most commonly between 2000 and 0500). The situation remains uncertain and amendments to the restrictions continue to be announced. You should take local advice on what restrictions are in place wherever you are in the Philippines and follow the instructions of local authorities.
An ‘Enhanced community quarantine’ has been imposed across Luzon Island until April 14. This will affect British Nationals’ ability to travel and access essential services, following the shutdown of all public transportation. Other areas of the Philippines have also announced their own local quarantine arrangements. This is an evolving situation, and you are advised to follow the announcements of local authorities across the country. The Philippine Government has confirmed that foreign nationals will be able to leave the Philippines at any time during the period of enhanced quarantine.
If you are in Luzon you will be permitted to travel to the nearest international airport within 24 hours prior to your scheduled departure, provided you have proof of scheduled international travel (i.e. travel itinerary or eticket). Outside of this 24 hour period you will be required to adhere to local quarantine restrictions.
There is disruption to travel routes both domestically and across the region. Check with your travel provider for updates.
As long as you have a valid visa you will be allowed to remain in the country, but will be required to observe the local government rules if your present location is under quarantine.
Our advice does not suggest that people should leave the Philippines if they consider the restrictions on movement will not impact them severely enough to make them want to leave.
Further information
The Philippine Department for Health and the Bureau of Immigration are issuing information about the situation on their websites. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you should contact your airline or nearest Philippine Embassy.
Further advice on coronavirus (COVID-19) is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
