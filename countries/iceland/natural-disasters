Iceland is volcanically and seismically active.
A small volcanic fissure eruption occurred in Meradalir on the Reykjanes peninsula in August 2022.
A fissure eruption also occurred close by in March 2021 at Geldingadalur on the Reykjanes Peninsula. Larger volcanic eruptions also took place in the area around the Bárðarbunga volcano on the Vatnajökull glacier in the east of Iceland in August 2014, and Eyjafjallajokull volcano in the south of Iceland in 2010 and Grimsvötn volcanoes erupted in 2010 and 2011 respectively causing disruption to Icelandic and European airspace.
Further volcanic eruptions are possible and there is the potential for sulphur dioxide and other volcanic gases to be emitted during eruptions as well as causing glacial floods. You should monitor alerts from the Icelandic Met Office and monitor the Almannavenir Facebook page and Twitter: @almannavarnir for the latest updates.
If you plan to visit the Reykjanes eruptions site please note the location is remote and the area is still seismically active. You can only reach the site via a hiking trail over rugged terrain that can take several hours each way. Make sure you have the right equipment. Good hiking shoes, warm clothing and wind and waterproof outerwear is essential.
Beware of gas emissions levels and take particular care if you have existing respiratory conditions. Monitor emissions and follow advice of the Icelandic Authorities.
DO NOT walk on lava from these eruptions. It is still very hot and fragile and dangerous to walk on.
Show caution in and around mountains/hills/slopes due to danger of rock fall and landslides.
There has been seismic activity in the South West and North of Iceland. Tremors can be numerous but usually don’t cause damage. However, they can cause rock falls and avalanches in the mountain areas. You should take care when driving and hiking in these areas. Follow the safety advice of the Icelandic authorities.
