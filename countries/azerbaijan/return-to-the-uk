There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani authorities have extended the suspension of all commercial passenger flights in to and out of Azerbaijan until 4 May.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Azerbaijan. We are working with the Azerbaijani authorities to encourage the resumption of flights to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
If you are booked on to an AZAL flight which has been cancelled you should speak with the airline or your travel agent.
British nationals who are not travellers but who are resident/working overseas are not being advised to return to the UK, but to follow the advice of the local authorities in their host country.
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.
There are options to extend your visa/temporary residence permit in Azerbaijan. See Visas
Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home
