a curfew between midnight and 4am

schools, universities and factories and places of worship are closed until further notice
a ban on all events/meetings of more than 10 people
the wearing of face masks in public places is compulsory
a 14 day self-isolation period for anyone entering the country with symptoms of COVID-19.
Land, sea and air borders re-opened on 1 July. The international airports in Port au Prince and Cap Haitien also re-opened on this date.
Several Canadian, American and Dominican airlines resumed a limited flight schedule from 1 July. You should follow the measures they have in place to limit the transmission of COVID-19.
The wearing of a face mask in the airport is obligatory. Arriving passengers will have their temperature taken and must provide contact details.
