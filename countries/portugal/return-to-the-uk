There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Portugal.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Portugal, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating.
Flights
British Airways and Ryanair are currently operating regular flights from Lisbon to London Heathrow and London Stansted. This is subject to change, and availability may reduce further. For latest information on flight status and availability, check the British Airways and Ryanair websites.
Travelling to the airport
Travel to Lisbon airport is permitted. There are rail and bus links to Lisbon city centre from most parts of the country. Taxis are still operating.
If you are coming to Lisbon by train, check availability and buy your ticket in advance online from CP, the Portuguese railway company. You will not be able to buy a ticket at the station. Get off the train at Entrecampos or Oriente.
If you are coming to Lisbon by bus, check availability and buy your ticket in advance online from the Rede Expressos, the Portuguese coach company. You will not be able to buy a ticket at the bus station or from the driver. Get off the bus at Sete Rios or Oriente.
Returning home from the Azores
If you have completed the mandatory period of self-quarantine in the Azores and you are now planning to return home, complete and submit this form to the health authorities. The health authorities will sign and return it to you so you can show it at the airport on departure.
The Regional Government has imposed restrictions on movement between municipalities on the Island of São Miguel. You can still travel to the airport, but you will be required to show your boarding pass or airline ticket to the police on request.
Road
There are border controls on the land border with Spain. Cross border workers, goods traffic and people entering or leaving Portugal to return to their place of residence will be allowed to travel.
You can still drive through Spain and France to return to the UK. The French government have implemented their own measures, including required documents for travel into, and transit through, France.
If you’re planning to travel through France, check the latest travel advice for France ahead of your journey.
For travel through Spain, you will be required to show evidence of onward travel (ie ferry booking). This letter in English, Spanish and French may also help you to explain to border authorities that you are travelling on to the UK.
The Spanish authorities have published a list of hotels and guesthouses (at the end of this document) that will remain open during the state of emergency. Check FCO travel advice for Spain before travelling.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
