On completion of the form, passengers will receive a QR code which must be shown to the Border Police on entry to Slovenia. The Digital Passenger Locator Form can be found here.
In addition to the Digital Passenger Locator Form, entry to Slovenia will only be allowed if one of the following is provided on arrival:

Anyone seeking to enter Slovenia who fails to submit one of the documents outlined above will be sent to quarantine at home for ten days. If the traveller does not have permanent or temporary residency in Slovenia, they will only be permitted to enter Slovenia and submit to 10 days of quarantine if they can prove they have somewhere to undertake that quarantine.
The Slovenian authorities will not permit entry from people who do not have permanent or temporary residency in Slovenia if they will be unable to leave Slovenia due to the measures in place in neighbouring countries.
Quarantine can be ended with a negative PCR test on Day 5.
People without permanent or temporary residency in Slovenia will be denied entry if they declare they are positive for COVID-19 or show obvious signs of infection of Covid-19. They will be permitted to transit through Slovenia, if upon entering they can unequivocally prove that their reason for entering is to transit Slovenia.
PCR tests, and Rapid Antigen Tests, vaccination certificates and certificates of illness conducted in the UK are accepted by the Slovenian authorities.
There are some exemptions whereby people will not be required to quarantine on entry if they cannot show one of the documents outlined above. Full details can be found at GOV.SI website.
Anyone required to enter into quarantine will need to provide an address (where they will be staying) to the Border authorities. Failure to do so may result in the Border authorities denying you entry into Slovenia. During self-isolation, you are required to stay in your accommodation and not socialise outside of your household. You can take short walks for exercise, but should maintain social distancing and not engage with people from outside your household. The local municipality can make arrangements for the delivery of essential supplies if friends or family cannot support you.
All arriving travellers will be given advice at the border regarding the steps they may need to take.
Internal checkpoints on the Schengen borders with Italy, Austria and Hungary have been removed.
If you are travelling to neighbouring countries you should check the travel advice for the latest information on entering those countries. See travel advice for Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Italy. If you remain in Slovenia, you should be aware that for stays longer than 90 days, you will be required to register as a Temporary Resident. Contact the Uprava Enota (the department that handles these applications) at +386 1 306 3034 or ue.ljubljana@gov.si. The department is open from Monday to Thursday from 8am-6pm and on Friday from 8am-2pm.

Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Slovenia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Regular entry requirements
Visas  
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Slovenia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Slovenian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Slovene Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, you may need
if you stay in Slovenia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Slovenia or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Slovenian border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Slovenia as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in the Slovenia your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Slovenian border control. For further information, see our Living in Slovenia guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovenia.
