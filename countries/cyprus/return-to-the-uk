For updates on future options for returning to the UK please monitor this page and our social media channels (UKinCyprus on Facebook and Twitter).
There are currently extremely limited, indirect commercial options available to return to the UK from Cyprus due to the near complete ban on flights to and from Cyprus until 9 June. Although a very limited number of commercial flights are still able to leave Cyprus, only humanitarian and cargo flights may arrive in the country.
On 22 May, the Cyprus government announced plans for a gradual reopening of airports from 9 June for flights from a limited number of countries, listed under categories A & B. Flights from the UK remain prohibited and will not operate until further notice.
You should contact your airline for the latest information on flight status and availability over the coming months, however please bear in mind that flights could be cancelled at short notice.
There are currently no flights between Turkey and the north of Cyprus until further notice.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
