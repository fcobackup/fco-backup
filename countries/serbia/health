At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
A number of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Serbia. The Serbian Government has announced a State of Emergency in response to the global pandemic of coronavirus (COVID-19), effective 15 March. A number of measures to limit the spread of the virus have been introduced. Infringements of these procedures may result in a prison sentence of up to three years.
The Serbian Ministry of Health website gives up to date information on the number of cases confirmed and tests carried out in Serbia. This website also includes helpline telephone numbers.
Airports remain open, although airline schedules are subject to change. Serbia has announced a temporary ban on entry for foreign nationals. Serbian nationals, diplomats, and foreign nationals with a residence permit are permitted to enter Serbia.
International arrivals (including from the UK) will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. Travellers from Italy, Romania, Spain, Germany, France, Austria, Slovenia and Greece are required to self-isolate for 28 days.
Some exemptions have been identified, including international cargo transport by road or river (time limits apply when in transit), and crews and cabin crews of aircraft arriving and transiting.
Within Serbia, the authorities have announced:
Suspension of closed public gatherings over 50 people.
Reduced public transport service.
Closure of all, schools, kindergartens and universities until further notice.
Those over the age of 65 are advised to stay at home.
Closure of sporting facilities. Limited opening hours for restaurants, bars and cafes.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Many border entry points, including with all neighbouring countries, have been closed to allow more thorough border checks at larger crossings. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Serbian Embassy or Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
Other health risks
High levels of air pollution can occur in Serbia. You can find further information and advice on air quality on the World Health Organization (WHO) website and check air quality levels on the World Air Quality Index Website.
Since October 2017 there have been more than 3,000 cases of measles in Serbia and around 10 deaths from complications. The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) advise anyone travelling abroad to make sure they’re up to date with routine vaccination courses and boosters as recommended in the UK, including the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.
Over 100 cases of the West Nile virus have been reported in Serbia, (around half in Belgrade), with about a dozen fatalities. You should take adequate precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
Local medical care
Some private clinics in Serbia offer treatment for addiction. You should seek advice from your local GP or health provider in the UK before undertaking such treatment.
There is a reciprocal healthcare agreement for British nationals visiting Serbia, which entitles you to free treatment for genuine emergencies. You’ll need to present a British passport, evidence of registration with the local police (if you’re not staying in a hotel) and a certificate confirming entitlement to benefit under the UK Social Security Acts. You can get this certificate from HM Revenue & Customs.
The health system in all parts of Serbia is suffering from widespread shortage of medicines and other essentials. For non-emergency treatment, or treatment that isn’t covered under reciprocal arrangements, payment in cash is normally required. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 194 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
