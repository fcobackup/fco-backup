The Tourist Office is identifying people who need to travel to/from St Helena so that they can be contacted once flight arrangements are confirmed. The Governorâ€™s Office in St Helena will inform the Tourist office when any flight options become available.
The Tourist Office is not able to engage with your airline, insurance company or booking agent on your behalf. You should go direct to these organisations to make bookings or get refunds.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Help and support
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
