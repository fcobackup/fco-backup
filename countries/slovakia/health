At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) and cases have been confirmed in many countries, including Slovakia. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
On 12 March, the Slovak government declared a State of Emergency and announced a range of restrictions on travel and events. No end date has been specified for most of these. The government has announced that only Slovak citizens and foreigners with permanent or temporary residence in Slovakia will be allowed to enter the country.
Slovakia has closed its international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad. Those returning to Slovakia from abroad will be instructed to self-isolate at home for 14 days.
All public gatherings have been banned, including sporting events and religious services. This includes theatres and cinemas, but not workplaces, supermarkets and pharmacies. All schools and universities are closed until 30 March. Local public transport is running on a reduced timetable and most will require you to wear a mask or otherwise cover your nose and mouth when travelling.
Restrictions apply to all public, social, sporting and cultural activity. All tourist and leisure sites, including ski resorts, spas and museums are closed. Many restaurants and hotels and all bars and nightclubs are closed. Most shops are also closed with exceptions for the sale of food, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
You can find more information about cases in Slovakia on the TravelHealthPro country page.
Further advice and information is available from the Slovak government website.
Healthcare
The rules on access to healthcare will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
You should get a free European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before leaving the UK. After 31 December 2020, your UK-issued EHIC might not be valid.
The EHIC entitles you to state provided medical treatment that may become necessary during your trip. Any treatment provided is on the same terms as Slovakian nationals. If you don’t have your EHIC with you or you’ve lost it, you can call the Department of Health Overseas Healthcare Team (+44 191 218 1999) to get a Provisional Replacement Certificate.
It is important to take out comprehensive travel insurance that includes cover for emergency medical treatment and associated costs. The existing EHIC arrangements are not an alternative to travel insurance, as some health-related costs, including for medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment, are not covered. Read more about what your travel insurance should cover.
If you’re living in Slovakia, you can also find more information on healthcare for residents in our Living In Slovakia guide.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 112 and ask for an ambulance. If you are referred to a medical facility for treatment you should contact your insurance/medical assistance company immediately.
The standard of medical facilities in Slovakia varies. Doctors are generally very good and medical equipment is constantly being improved. However, many hospitals are under-maintained and there are few English- speaking receptionists and nurses.
