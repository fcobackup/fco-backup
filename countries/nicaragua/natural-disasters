Nicaragua is prone to seismic and volcanic activity, hurricanes, severe storms and flooding.
Earthquakes
Seismic activity is common throughout Central America and can happen at any time. Make sure you know what to do if a tremor or earthquake occurs. Read the hotel earthquake instructions. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake or tsunami.
Hurricanes
The hurricane season normally runs from June to November. You should monitor the local and international weather updates from the  World Meteorological Organisation and the National Hurricane Centre. 
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you are caught up in a storm.
Flooding
The wet season is from April to October. During this season (especially in rural areas) landslides, flooding and bridge collapses can cause cancellation of local flights and other travel disruption.
Volcanoes
A spine of volcanoes, several of which are active stretches the length of the country, in particular San Cristobal, Masaya, Cerro Negro, Telica and Concepcion on Ometepe Island. Follow media reports and keep in touch with the local authorities if you intend to visit the area.
