From 4 July, the Netherlands is exempt from the FCO advice against all non-essential international travel. This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
This does not include the constituent countries and special municipalities located in the Dutch Caribbean. Check separate travel advice pages for these areas.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
The Dutch government has adopted the European Union’s recommendation to lift its travel ban for residents of a number of countries from 1 July.

This ban is not applicable to UK and EU nationals.
