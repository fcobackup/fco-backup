Everyone re-entering the Czech Republic must undergo a 14 day self-isolation period on their return to the Czech Republic, or have evidence that they tested negatively for Covid-19 in the previous four days. . There are exemptions for limited categories of workers: details are on the website of the Czech Ministry of the Interior.
