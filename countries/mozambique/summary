The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to:
the districts of Nangade, Quissanga, Ibo, Macomia, Mocimboa da Praia and Palma in Cabo Delgado province, due to attacks by groups with links to Islamic extremism.
the provinces of Sofala, Zambezia, Manica and Tete, which have been affected by Tropical Cyclone Idai.
Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall at the port city of Beira on Thursday 14 March. The cyclone has devastated critical infrastructure in the provinces of Sofala, Zambezia, Manica and Tete, including electricity, communication and road networks. Access to the affected areas remains challenging. Many roads and bridges in the affected areas are impassable. Extensive flooding still exists. You should continue to monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation and follow any advice given by the local authorities. See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you are caught up in a storm.
Following Tropical Cyclone Idai there is an increased risk of typhoid fever and cholera in a number of areas of the country. The situation is being monitored by the World Health Organisation. You should familiarise yourself with the symptoms and follow the advice of the National Travel Health Network and Centre. See Health
There has an been an increasing intensity of attacks in Cabo Delgado since May 2018, with attacks reported in the districts of Palma, Mocimboa da Praia, Macomia, Nangade, Quissanga, Muidumbe, Meluco and Ibo.

There are reports of an increased security presence in the province, including road blocks, and there are regular clashes between insurgents, armed vigilante groups and Mozambican security forces.
