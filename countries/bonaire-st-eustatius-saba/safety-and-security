Crime
Most visits to the BES Islands are trouble-free. However, petty theft and street crime is a concern. There is violent crime amongst members of the illegal drugs world, but this rarely affects tourists. The main tourist areas are generally safe, but you should take normal precautions. Avoid remote areas at night. Don’t take valuables to the beach. Make sure purses and handbags are closed and not easy to snatch.
The BES islands continue to be used to smuggle illegal drugs from South America to Europe and North America. You should have a heightened sense of awareness of this problem and never leave bags unattended. Under no circumstances should you discuss or agree to carry a package for anyone. Some airports have installed body scanners and it is possible you may need to have a scan. Dutch authorities generally screen all baggage and passengers from the Dutch Caribbean.
Local travel
When taking a taxi, always check that it is a registered one and negotiate the price before taking the ride. Most taxis do not have meters.
Road travel
Traffic drives on the right. Main road conditions are relatively good, but roads can become slippery when wet.
Political situation
On 10 October 2010 the Netherlands Antilles were dissolved and Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba (now known as the BES islands) became special municipalities of the Netherlands. Bonaire lies within 50 miles of Venezuela, whilst St Eustatius (Statia) and Saba are some 600 miles to the north east, about 100 miles east of Puerto Rico.
