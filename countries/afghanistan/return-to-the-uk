If you live in the UK and are currently travelling in Afghanistan, you are strongly advised to return now, where and while there are still commercial routes available. You should contact airlines and travel agents immediately and keep up to date with the latest developments.
International travel is becoming very limited as air routes close, land borders close and new restrictions are put in place that prevent flights from leaving.
If you are a permanent resident overseas, you should stay and follow the advice of local authorities.
Please check with your carrier before travelling as many countries or areas are restricting travel at very short, or without, notice in response to the COVID-19
