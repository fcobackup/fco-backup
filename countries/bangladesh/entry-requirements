The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and borders
Bangladesh authorities have said passengers arriving from coronavirus-affected countries, including the UK, should complete Health Declaration Forms and Passenger Locator Forms provided by cabin crew. You may be subjected to additional health screening measures at the airport.
On 14 May the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) announced an extension of the temporary suspension of scheduled commercial passenger flights from 7 to 30 May. Scheduled commercial passenger flights departing from the following countries will not be authorised to land at any international airport in Bangladesh: Bahrain, Bhutan, Hong Kong, India, Kuwait, Malaysia, the Maldives, Nepal, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey, UAE, and the UK.
Medical certificate
On arrival in Bangladesh, all foreign nationals are required to produce a medical certificate issued within 72 hours of travel indicating the passenger is symptom free. Passengers arriving from coronavirus affected countries, including the UK, are also required to quarantine for 14 days. Health officials at the point of entry to Bangladesh will assess whether passengers are able to self-quarantine or need to be taken to a government facility.
On 26 March, the Bangladesh authorities announced particular measures for passengers arriving with a No Visa Required certificate (an arrangement for foreign nationals of Bangladeshi heritage). Such passengers arriving in Bangladesh without a medical certificate indicating the passenger is symptom–free from coronavirus, or such passengers who display symptoms, will be placed into quarantine in a government facility for 14 days. Such passengers who arrive with a medical certificate indicating they are symptom-free are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You’ll need a visa to enter Bangladesh. You can get a visa from the Bangladesh High Commission in London. Bangladesh authorities have suspended issuing visas on arrival until 30 May. Foreign nationals currently in Bangladesh with valid visas have the option of extending their visas by three months. Visa extensions are available at the Department of Immigration and Passport of Bangladesh. You should be aware that overstaying your visa could risk the imposition of penalty fines.
If you intend to use Dhaka as a hub to visit other countries in the region, make sure you get a multiple entry visa. If you’re intending to work in Bangladesh make sure you get the correct visa before you travel.
If you have had your passport renewed in Bangladesh, you’ll need a new visa. The Bangladesh Immigration & Passport Department (telephone: 880 2 8159878 / 8123788 / 8123323) is able to issue an ‘exit visa’ or a ‘no visa required’ stamp. Officers there are unlikely to speak English, so you may need an interpreter.
Make sure you have an entry stamp placed in your passport on entry into Bangladesh otherwise you may have problems on departure.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 6 months when applying for a visa to visit Bangladesh.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Bangladesh. Holders of an ETD must apply for the appropriate Bangladesh visa to enter Bangladesh.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Working in Bangladesh
Foreign nationals working in Bangladesh must get an Income Tax Clearance Certificate or an Income Tax Exemption Certificate before each departure from Bangladesh. Full details are available on the Bangladesh Board of Revenue website.
