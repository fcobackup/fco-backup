Tongan society is very conservative and highly religious. You will be expected to dress modestly and respect local customs and culture. Tonga strictly observes the Sabbath. On Sundays any recreational activities undertaken outside of island resorts may be seen as provocative. 
Homosexuality is technically illegal in many Pacific countries and the law is occasionally enforced. Open displays of affection between same-sex partners may cause offence. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Drug taking in all forms is illegal. Importing or exporting illegal drugs attracts a maximum penalty of 30 years hard labour and/or a fine of several hundred thousand US dollars. Those found guilty of cultivating or distributing illegal drugs are likely to receive similarly severe punishment.
