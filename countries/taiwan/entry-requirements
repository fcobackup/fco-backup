All travellers
Travel ban on foreign nationals
Taiwan has in place a temporary ban on foreign nationals entering Taiwan. However there are certain exceptions, as follows.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has announced that, from 13 April 2022, foreign relatives of Taiwan citizens and foreign residents in Taiwan, with the exception of migrant workers, are now able to apply for a special entry permit to enter Taiwan. Applicants will be required to complete an online visa application form and to submit the required documentation to the Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA) for consideration.
In addition, exceptions apply for the following groups: ARC/APRC/Gold Card holders, business travellers, foreign spouses of Taiwan passport holders and their children under the age of 20, foreign relatives of Taiwan passport holders, international students and foreign professors and researchers.
All foreign nationals will be required to have obtained the correct entry permissions and a visa before they arrive in Taiwan. Currently there is no set date for when these border measures will be lifted. Exceptions may be made for emergency or humanitarian reasons. You should contact your local Taipei Representative Office for further information. Anyone entering Taiwan will be required to follow the quarantine requirements set out below.
All passengers travelling to Taiwan will be required to follow the quarantine and testing requirements set out below.
Screening on arrival
All passengers arriving or transiting in Taiwan are required to present a certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken within two calendar days of boarding their flight to Taiwan. The test will be calculated based on the “specimen collection date” not the test report date. Any exemption due to exceptional circumstances will require prior approval before departure.
Test Certificates of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR must be issued by a recognised medical institution in the country of departure and include the following information:
the passenger’s full name as per their passport,
the date of birth or passport number of the traveller,
specimen collection date and test report date,
the virus name, testing method and the test result
Test Certificates are required to be produced in either English or Chinese; however, in situations where the passenger provides a certificate in either French or Spanish, if the certificate is in the official language of the place of departure, and ground personnel of the airline are able to assist with the inspection of the content, the certificate may be accepted.
All passengers arriving in Taiwan will be required to undergo a COVID-19 RT-PCR test upon arrival. Passengers who arrive on a long haul flight will be required to wait for the result of this test at the airport before they are permitted to depart for their quarantine facility. The local authorities will cover the cost of the COVID-19 RT-PCR test. Any individual who receives a positive COVID-19 test will not be permitted to quarantine at their residential property or proposed quarantine hotel in Taiwan. Individuals with mild symptoms will be admitted into an enhanced centralised quarantine centre or hotel for the mandatory ten day quarantine period (see below). Any individual with more severe symptoms may be hospitalised.
Anyone found to provide false or incorrect test results, or evade or obstruct the quarantine measures, may face a fine of between NT$10,000 to NT$150,000 and further criminal charges.
Refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control for further information regarding Test Exemptions, Test Certificates and COVID-19 test requirements.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Quarantine requirements for passengers arriving in Taiwan
Starting from 9 May 2022, the mandatory quarantine period for international arrivals in Taiwan will be reduced from 10 to 7 days, followed by a 7 day self-health management period. The quarantine requirements from this date will remain the same as those recorded below, however, you will be required to undergo a rapid COVID-19 test on the seventh day of your quarantine.
All passengers arriving in Taiwan from the UK before 9 May 2022, will be required to complete a mandatory 10 day quarantine and 7 day self-health management period. Passengers will be able to choose whether they wish to complete their mandatory quarantine at their residential property, a quarantine hotel or a designated quarantine facility.
You will be required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at the airport and a further self-administered rapid COVID-19 test will be required on the last day of your mandatory quarantine. You should submit the result of your rapid COVID-19 test to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) using the instructions provided. The local authorities will cover the costs of the COVID-19 PCR test and the self-administered rapid COVID-19 test.
Passengers who are eligible and choose to complete their mandatory quarantine at their residential property rather than a quarantine hotel or a designated quarantine facility will be required to declare that their residence complies with quarantine requirements.
Any individual who receives a positive COVID-19 test will not be permitted to quarantine at their residential property or proposed quarantine hotel in Taiwan. Individuals with mild symptoms will be admitted into an enhanced centralised quarantine centre or hotel for their mandatory quarantine. Any individual with more severe symptoms may be hospitalised.

Restrictions apply and not all British nationals will be eligible. You cannot apply more than 15 days before the 180 day point. For more information, you should contact the National Immigration Agency (NIA). The British Office is unable to issue letters or endorsements to support any application to remain.
