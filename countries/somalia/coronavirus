Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Somalia. The Somalian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
This includes not allowing entry and/or requiring self-isolation for travellers from certain affected countries and enforcing screening at entry points.
Travelers will not be allowed entry to Somalia if they started their journey or transited China, Iran, Italy or the Republic of Korea within the preceding 14 days.
There are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Somaliland. Travelers will be subject to 14 days self-isolation if they started their journey or transited China, France, Iran, Italy, Kenya, the Republic of Korea or Spain in the preceding 14 days.
Entry screening has been introduced and individuals may be detained in isolation pending the results of testing for the virus.
Land borders with neighbouring countries may close at short notice. You should check with local authorities before travelling to the border. You should also monitor Travel Advice for Ethiopia or Kenya. You should not cross the border without the correct documents.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping to reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
