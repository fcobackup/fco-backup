There are currently limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Senegal. The Government of Senegal has closed land borders and airspace has been closed to commercial airlines except for flights with ‘special authorisation’. This is changing from 15 July, when borders will re-open for international flights, though land and sea borders will remain closed.
If you cannot leave Senegal at this time, see advice on staying in Senegal during coronavirus.
Future Options
Commercial options via France
Air France flights to Paris are flying four times a week from Dakar to Paris in July. You can buy tickets from Air France (Senegal).

The British Embassy in Dakar is asking all British nationals currently in Senegal to make themselves known to the Embassy by emailing UKinSenegal@fco.gov.uk.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Carte d’étranger
From 29 June it is again possible to obtain a “carte d’étranger” from the local authorities. If your visa has expired because of the coronavirus crisis, you should report to the Police des Étrangers et des Titres de Voyage in order to renew your visa.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
