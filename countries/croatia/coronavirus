Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Croatia on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
If you test positive for COVID-19 whilst you are in Croatia you should follow advice from the local authorities and get in touch with the local epidemiologist. Call 113 (from a Croatian number) for general advice about COVID-19. Arrangements for self-isolation and the associated costs may vary, but you should be prepared to make your own arrangements for self-isolation and bear any related costs. If you test positive for COVID-19, do not attempt to check in for your flight, as you may be subject to a fine from the Croatian Police.
International travel
You should follow the advice of the local authorities in the most appropriate way to protect yourself and others, including any measures brought in to control the virus. These measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should check local guidance for further information and details about restrictions in Croatia.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes, which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Croatia
There are no restrictions on regional travel within Croatia.
Face masks
Whilst it is no longer a requirement to wear a mask in indoor settings, or for large gatherings, it is still a requirement in pharmacies and medical facilities. You should follow the guidance of your airline or transport provider as some may still require you to wear a mask.
Public places and services
If you need to demonstrate vaccination status whilst in Croatia, the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies are recognised. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days previously. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
