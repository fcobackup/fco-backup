ATMs are available in Phnom Penh, Sihanoukville and Siem Reap and in some other major towns. Take care when withdrawing cash and be aware of your surroundings.
Not all ATMs and banks accept foreign debit and credit cards. Check with your bank before you travel. Credit cards are not widely accepted, but some hotels and businesses in larger cities will accept them.
The US dollar is the main currency in Cambodia but the Cambodian Riel is becoming more widely used. Prices in hotels, shops and restaurants are now usually quoted in US dollars and Riel. Change of less than $10 will generally be given in Riel at a rate of around 4000 Riels/US$1.
There have been recent reports of counterfeit dollar notes being given as change in shops and clubs. Difficulties can also be encountered when trying to spend damaged notes. You should check that notes you receive are genuine and are not damaged or torn. Banks and money exchange shops will sometimes replace damaged notes but will often charge for this service.
It may not be possible to exchange Northern Irish and Scottish bank notes.
