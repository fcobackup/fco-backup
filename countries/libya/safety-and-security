Political situation
The political situation in Libya remains fragile and the security situation remains dangerous and unpredictable. A UN-facilitated ceasefire in 2020 ended militarised clashes between eastern and western armed groups, which led to an estimated 1,000 civilian casualties. While the risk of renewed fighting between eastern and western forces has decreased, the risk of localised violence between competing armed groups remains high. Outbreaks of violence between armed groups can occur with little warning. In August 2022, clashes between armed groups in Tripoli killed 32 people and injured over 150. Clashes again broke out between 14 and 15 August 2023 in central Tripoli.
Foreign forces and mercenaries continue to operate in Libya.  The Interim Government of National Unity has limited control of security provision across the country. The lack of political stability has led to security incidents, road and airport closures, and oil blockades. There have been protests throughout Libya against the continued political deadlock, lack of basic service provision and corruption.
If you choose to travel to Libya against FCDO advice, you should monitor the local security situation carefully, remain vigilant, and have robust security arrangements and contingency plans in place.
Public infrastructure and services
The provision of basic services across Libya varies. Petrol can be difficult to access and there are regularly long queues at fuel stations. There can also be power outages in Tripoli and the south and east, particularly in the summer months.
Crime
Crime is widespread across Libya and violent robbery, carjacking and smuggling of fuel, drugs, weapons and people are common across the country. Armed groups and local security services regularly carry out operations against criminal gangs.
If you choose to travel to Libya against FCDO advice, take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings. Foreign nationals may be a target for criminals operating in Libya and should exercise caution when travelling throughout the country, particularly at night. Consider your route and vary daily routines. Conceal expensive looking items which could draw unwanted attention.
Detention
Libya’s intelligence services and armed groups have detained British nationals in the past 12 months. You are at an elevated risk of detention if you are working in a field likely to be of suspicion to the intelligence services and armed groups, including but not limited to, private security, journalism or for NGOs. You should be aware that if you are detained in Libya by any of these groups, your health and welfare may be put at serious risk, especially if you have an existing medical condition. The British Embassy will have extremely limited capability to assist you or intervene on your behalf. Any assistance will be even more limited for dual nationals of Libyan origin as you will be in your home country and dual nationality is not recognised by the Libyan authorities.
Foreign nationals have been arrested for failing to provide the correct documentation when requested.
Local travel
In the event of a further deterioration of the security situation, routes in and out of major cities and towns may become blocked and airports closed or inaccessible at little or no notice.
Don’t advertise your travel or other plans through social media. Avoid routine, vary your travel routes, and keep a low profile at all times.
Road traffic accidents are common.  Facilities or services available to help in the case of a road traffic accident may be limited.
Travel for media/journalism purposes
If you’re entering Libya as a media representative, you should get press accreditation from the relevant Libyan authorities.
There are often complex bureaucratic procedures in place when operating in Libya, so it is important to ensure you follow all relevant protocols and procedures and be sensitive to local customs.
Journalists, including foreign nationals, are vulnerable to harassment, intimidation and detention by armed groups and Libya’s intelligence services. There is a real risk of hostility from those who object to media reporting. Journalism and media activity are likely to attract attention from armed groups and Libya’s intelligence services who may treat foreign media with suspicion. International and local journalists have previously been detained in Libya.
Road travel
Road travel within Libya remains highly dangerous. There continues to be a risk of being caught up in outbreaks of localised violence between armed groups. There is also a high risk of carjacking, robbery and of striking unexploded ordnance off-road. The coastal road between Zawiyah and Tripoli presents an elevated risk. Road traffic accidents are frequent and often result in fatalities. All land borders into Libya are subject to closure at short notice.
Air travel
Flights to and from all airports in Libya are likely to be cancelled at short notice.
Tripoli International Airport has been closed since July 2014, following clashes that broke out between armed groups in the area surrounding the airport. Other airports may change their flight schedule without notice. Mitiga airport is Tripoli’s only currently functioning civilian airport. Fighting between armed groups in the area caused Mitiga Airport to temporarily close on 23 February 2023.
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in Libya that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority.
