Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Belarus.

FCDO advises against all travel to Belarus.
Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
The standard of healthcare is below that of the UK.
See FCDO’s list of English-speaking healthcare providers in Belarus.
Emergency medical number
Dial 103 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Most people in Belarus only speak Russian or Belarusian, so emergency services staff may not speak English. You may need to find someone who speaks English to interpret for you.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check:
the latest information on vaccinations and health risks on TravelHealthPro
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
If you might have COVID-19
If you develop COVID-19 symptoms in Belarus, call the emergency services on 103. You will be directed to your nearest Regional Public Health Care Centre. Have your medical insurance details available.
Medication
You should bring essential personal medication because the availability of local supplies cannot be guaranteed.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
TravelHealthPro explains best practice when travelling with medicines.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
For more information on the legal status of a specific medicine, contact the Embassy of Belarus in the UK.
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also guidance on TravelHealthPro.
Drinking water quality
Do not drink village well water. It is usually heavily contaminated with impurities. In cities, boil then filter tap water before drinking. Bottled water is widely available.
