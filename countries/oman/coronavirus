International travel
Oman suspended all international flights on Sunday 29 March and land borders are closed. There are currently no scheduled direct commercial flights between the UK from Oman.
Subject to demand, Oman Air and other airlines are operating ad hoc special flights to London Heathrow and occasionally other European destinations. Information about these flights, along with details of how to book, will appear in the English-language local media and on the airlines’ social media sites (but not their website).
These flights will no longer be advertised on our Travel Advice pages, but we will flag them on the British Embassy social media sites (Facebook, Twitter or Instagram) as and when such flights become available.
