This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Latvia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Latvian embassy/consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
If you are travelling to Latvia for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry into Latvia is permitted for essential travel only, defined as for work, studies, transit, medical treatment, funerals, family reunions, returning to your residence, and accompanying a minor.
Everyone who intends to enter Latvia is required to complete and submit an electronic form no earlier than 48 hours before entering Latvia. Further information is available on the Latvian government’s COVID-19 website.
All travellers entering Latvia, including children aged 11 and above, are required to present evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result taken not earlier than 72 hours before boarding or before crossing the Latvian border individually, for example by road. Passengers who are unable to present evidence of a negative COVID-19 test will be denied boarding. The certification must be in English, French, Russian or in the official language of the country from where the journey begins. There are very limited exemptions to the requirement to present evidence of a negative COVID-19 test. The test must be a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.
Everyone entering Latvia from outside the EU, EEA, Switzerland and the UK by land, sea or air must pay for and take another COVID-19 test immediately on arrival. If the test is negative, you will need to self-isolate for 10 days in your place of residence. If the test is positive, you must quarantine yourself at your own expense at a hotel approved by the Latvian government. The list of approved hotels is on the Riga City Council Welfare Department website.
Quarantine requirements
Asymptomatic travellers arriving in Latvia from a country (or who have been in a country in the previous 14 days) where the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in 100,000 of population over the previous 14 days exceeds 50, are required to self-isolate for 10 days after leaving that country. These countries are listed in the table of comparative epidemiological data published every Friday on the Latvian Centre for Disease Prevention and Control website. Travellers who have been in contact with a COVID-19 infected person or who work in Latvia in the medical professions, as teachers, or as social workers are still required to self-isolate for 14 days.
New regulations have been introduced from 16 June which lifts the ban on non-essential travel and the requirement to self-isolate for individuals who meet certain criteria. Specifically, this applies to:
Travellers who have had COVID-19 in the last 6 months and have recovered from it and can provide proof with an EU digital certificate (via smart device or printed) or a certificate issued in the EU, EEA countries, Switzerland or the United Kingdom.
• Travellers who can provide proof with an EU digital certificate (via smart device or printed) or a certificate issued in the EU, EEA countries, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, stating that you have received full vaccination (i.e. 15 days have elapsed since the completion of a full vaccination course) and what vaccine you were vaccinated with (exemption from self-isolation only applies to vaccines registered by the European Medicines Agency or equivalent regulators or recognised by the World Health Organisation).
Further details on self-isolation are on the Latvian Centre for Disease Prevention and Control website and the Latvian government’s COVID-19 website:
if you are required to self-isolate you must carefully monitor your health for the period of self-isolation, including by taking your body temperature twice a day (in the morning and evening)
if you experience mild flu-like (increased body temperature, cough, sore throat) symptoms for at least two days you should call 8303. The dispatcher will then evaluate on a case-by-case basis and refer you to a testing point or send a medical unit to you if you are unable to travel to a testing point
in case of sudden onset of at least one of the following symptoms – dry cough, fever, shortness of breath – restrict contact with people nearby, but in case this is not possible, keep a distance of at least two metres from them, and call 113 immediately (State Emergency Medical Service).
If you have arrived in Latvia and are self-isolating but wish to leave Latvia before the end of your self-isolation period you should call the Latvian State Police on 110 and let them know of your intended departure.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Demonstrating your vaccination status from the UK is not formalised for entry into Latvia, so you should follow alternative advice for entry. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Neighbouring countries
Check country-specific FCDO Travel Advice for details of travel restrictions in the neighbouring countries Estonia and Lithuania.
You should follow the local quarantine measures of the country that you are in.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Latvia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Latvian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Latvian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Latvia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Latvia or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Latvian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you were legally resident in Latvia before 1 January 2021, your rights will be protected by the Withdrawal Agreement. You must apply for a new residence status by 30 June 2021 to secure your rights.
You should carry your residence document, as well as your valid passport, when you travel. If you have applied for but not yet received your document, carry a copy of your certificate of application.
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Latvia. If you are resident in Latvia, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Latvia guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Health insurance
You are required to have health insurance when you enter Latvia. This must include repatriation costs. Those who require visas for Latvia (other than EU family members) will need to show their policies upon arrival in Latvia.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Latvia.
