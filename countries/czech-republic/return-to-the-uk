From Saturday 14 March, cross-border bus, train and ferry services are suspended.
International air travel is now limited to Prague airport, which remains open, but flights are being cancelled. If youâ€™re currently in the Czech Republic and want to leave the country, you should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible to ensure departure. Please check with your carrier before travelling to Prague airport to see if your flight is affected.
UK and other foreign nationals will still be allowed to travel out of the Czech Republic by car after that time but will not be allowed to re-enter.
Road travel into Germany, Poland and Austria is currently restricted to 11 designated border crossings. Countries neighbouring the Czech Republic, including Slovakia, Germany, Austria and Poland, are also affected by restrictions. Please check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details.
The government has confirmed that foreign tourists already in the Czech Republic will be able to return home.
