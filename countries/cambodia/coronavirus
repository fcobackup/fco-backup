Visas
Suspension of tourist visas, e-visas, visa on arrival and visa exemptions came in to effect on 31 March. The latest information on visas from the relevant authorities is as below:
Tourist Visa: For all short term visitors arriving on or after 01 January 2020, tourist visas will be automatically extended and any overstay fines will be waived. Visitors are not required to go to the immigration department office for any kind of exit visa/stamp before departing. All departing visitors can proceed directly to the airport to depart through the normal immigration channels.
Other Visas: For non-tourist visas such as EG visas, there is no automatic extension in place and these can be renewed at any time in the usual way.
Foreigners Registration
The Interior Ministry’s General Department of Immigration has recently announced that it will deny visa extensions for foreigners who are not registered on the Foreigners Present in Cambodia System (FPCS) by 1 July 2020. The FPCS will be used to record and manage foreigners’ information when they arrive at any entry point and record their data when they leave Cambodia. Its main objective is to protect foreigner safety and security in case of an emergency during their stay in Cambodia.
The FPSC Cambodia App is free to download for IOS and Android.
There is a video tutorial from the General Department of Immigration on how the app works (although the video has Khmer narration, the images are with English text).
The in-app tutorial is in English. There are 6 steps for registration:

Phnom Penh Municipal and all provincial police chiefs have been asked to inform landlords to report foreigners staying in their properties. You should check with your landlord to confirm that they have registered you on the app, otherwise, you should register yourself on the app.
