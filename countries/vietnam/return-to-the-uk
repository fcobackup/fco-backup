If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Vietnam you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded. UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
International flights
There are very few remaining international flights out of Vietnam and they are reducing rapidly as a result of travel restrictions in the region and globally.
Vietnam Airlines has confirmed that its special commercial flight from Hanoi to London on 14 April will go ahead. This flight will begin its journey in Phnom Penh. British and Irish nationals will be given priority, but the flight is open to all nationalities with the right UK visa. You can book this flight online via the Vietnam Airlines website until 9pm Vietnam time on 13 April (3pm UK time). Tickets can also be bought at the airport in Hanoi with either cash or credit card.
After the Vietnam Airlines flight on 14 April, the only remaining option from Vietnam is via South Korea. The British Embassy is issuing regular updates on Twitter with the latest available information on flight departure options from Vietnam.
Travelling to the airport
There are currently very limited, or in some cases no, taxis or Grab taxis available to take you to international airports in Vietnam. We understand that private hire cars are still allowed to take passengers to airports.
If you’re concerned about getting to the airports in Hanoi & HCMC in light of travel restrictions, we are able to provide you with a letter to facilitate your travel. If you need this letter, please contact us immediately at support@fcowebmail.fco.gov.uk with the following details, including for any British nationals accompanying you: full names (on passport), current location in Vietnam, and confirmed flight details.
Accessing departure airports
There are now severe restrictions on internal flight routes, with limited availability only remaining on three routes: Hanoi-HCMC, Hanoi-Danang, and HCMC-Danang. From 6 April, there are also restrictions on the number of passengers able to fly per day to HCMC.
The British Embassy is issuing regular updates on social media with the latest available flight information.
Road and rail options are also increasingly restricted, and travel between Vietnamese provinces might not be as straightforward as normal.
