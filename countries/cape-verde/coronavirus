The use of a face covering is mandatory in enclosed spaces, e.g supermarkets, shops, health centres, banks, schools, public services, airports and port, restaurants and cafés and on public transport. Face coverings are also mandatory outdoors where social distancing cannot be maintained. This applies to everyone over the age of 10.

Healthcare in Cape Verde
If you’ve got COVID-19 symptoms you must self-isolate for 14 days. The government of Cape Verde has set up a free helpline, which you can call if you have any concerns about coronavirus: +238 (0)800 1112. This helpline is only available in Portuguese.
If you need medicine, you will only be able to buy it from a pharmacy. Unlike in the UK, non-prescription medication is not available in supermarkets or other shops. There are a limited number of Pharmacies on each island and they are usually identified by a green cross. Find a pharmacy near you on the Pharmacy Network website.
If you have a UK prescription, take it to a pharmacy and ask the pharmacist whether they can dispense your medication for you. Remember the pharmacist will have to apply national rules so may not be able to give you the same strength or dosage. Some medicines may not be available or may not be authorised for sale in Cape Verde. In some cases, the medicine might not be in stock so they will need to order it. This can take up to a week or more.
If you need a repeat prescription, go to the nearest health centre or hospital A&E.
