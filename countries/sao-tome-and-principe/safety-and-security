Crime
Crime rates are generally low, but burglaries and armed robberies do occur. Safeguard valuables and cash, particularly at the beach. Use a hotel safe where practical, and keep copies of important documents, including your passport.  
Road travel
You should bring a valid International Driving Permit if you wish to hire a car. Traffic is light but the majority of roads are in poor condition and unlit, particularly outside the capital. You should avoid being on the road at night as you may encounter animals on the roads and during periods of heavy rainfall as landslips and mudslides can occur.
Taxis and motorbike taxis (known as “motoqueiros”) are the only forms of public transport. You should note that it is common practice for taxis to be shared. You should take the same safety precautions as in the UK and check your travel insurance.
Air travel
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in São Tomé and Príncipe that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority.
Political Situation
São Tomé and Príncipe is generally peaceful. Economic difficulties and political rows over the handling of investments in the islands’ development occasionally lead to civil unrest.
