Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Eritrea.

This section has safety advice for regions of Eritrea. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Eritrea-Djibouti border
FCDO advises against all travel to within 25km of Eritrea’s border with Djibouti.  
In 2008 there was fighting between Djibouti and Eritrea after an incursion of Eritrean forces into the disputed Djibouti border region. The situation remains fragile.
Eritrea-Ethiopia border
FCDO advises against all travel to within 25km of Eritrea’s border with Ethiopia because of military activity on both sides of the border.
Eritrea-Sudan border
FCDO advises against all travel to within 25km of Eritrea’s border with Sudan because of military activity on both sides of the border.
Hanish Islands
It is highly unlikely that Eritrean authorities will issue permits for any vessels to visit the south-western Hanish Islands. These islands are very close to the conflict in Yemen. The authorities have previously detained mariners who landed without a permit. 
Landmines near borders
There is a risk of landmines near Eritrea’s borders, particularly in the Eritrea-Ethiopia and Eritrea-Djibouti border areas. If you are in the border area against FCDO advice, do not leave the main paved highways by car or on foot.
