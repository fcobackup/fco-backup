Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Turkey.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 112 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on vaccinations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Turkey guide
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
UKHSA has detected an increase in gastrointestinal infections in travellers returning from Turkey, with over 200 cases of Salmonella detected since the beginning of 2023. Further information is available from UKHSA.  See NaTHNaC’s advice on food and water hygiene.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries. Some common medicines are controlled in Turkey. For more information and the documentation needed, contact the nearest Turkish Embassy or Consulate. Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad. British prescriptions are not accepted in pharmacies in Turkey. In some cases, you may be able to liaise with Turkish hospitals and your GP to arrange for a Turkish prescription for the equivalent medicine.
Health insurance cards
The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) and Global Health Insurance card (GHIC) are not valid in Turkey.

Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
Medical tourism
Medical tourism is when people travel to have medical, surgical or dental treatment abroad. Cosmetic surgery, dental procedures and cardiac surgery are the most common procedures for medical tourists.
The standard of medical facilities and available treatments can vary widely globally. We are aware of over 25 British nationals who have died in Turkey since January 2019 following medical procedures. There were reports of an outbreak of botulism linked to weight loss treatments performed in Istanbul and Izmir in February 2023. You can find further information about botulism in Turkey on TravelHealthPro.
If you are considering travelling to Turkey for medical, surgical or dental treatment, you should:
read more advice on going abroad for medical treatment and elective surgery
discuss plans with your UK doctor before going ahead with any medical procedures abroad 
do your own research - private companies have a financial interest in arranging your medical treatment abroad and the information they provide should not be your only source of information
Find further advice on medical tourism from TravelHealthPro, and NHS guidance on going abroad for medical treatment, and (if relevant to you) on cosmetic surgery abroad. 
The Turkish Ministry of Health provides a list of its approved medical providers on the HealthTurkiye website. This website is for information only.
