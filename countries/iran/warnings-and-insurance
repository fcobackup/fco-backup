FCDO advises against all travel to Iran
Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against FCDO advice. Consular support is also severely limited where FCDO advises against travel.
FCDO advises against all travel to Iran. British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arbitrary arrest, questioning or detention in Iran. Holding a British passport can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to question you. If you are detained in Iran, you could face months or years in prison.
Find out more about why FCDO advises against travel.
Support for British nationals in Iran 
Consular support is extremely limited in Iran. If you need consular assistance you should contact the British Embassy in Tehran. 
Dual nationals 
The Iranian authorities do not recognise dual nationality. If you’re a British-Iranian dual national and you are detained in Iran, the authorities will not tell FCDO or grant FCDO access to see you. If you’re detained, your case will be in the hands of the Iranian authorities, who have shown a pattern of hostility towards the UK and British citizens.
