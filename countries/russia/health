Since June 2016, foreign citizens can bring medication for personal use with them, as long as they don’t contain narcotic or psychoactive substances. All these drugs are listed on the Rossiyskaya Gazeta website (in Russian).
If your medication does contain highly potent or narcotic poisonous substances and you wish to bring it with you, you’ll need to provide a prescription in your name which has been translated into Russian, and then notarised (notarisation services in the UK are available from a Notary Public).
If you’re unsure whether you need to provide a prescription and notarised translation to bring your medicines into the country, you should check with the Russian Embassy in London or Consulate General in Edinburgh.
