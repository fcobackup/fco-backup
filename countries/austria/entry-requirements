The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Austria
If you’re entering Austria from, or are resident in, a country for which the Austrian Foreign Ministry has a travel warning in place, including the UK, you must be able to present at the border a medical certificate with micro-biological test results in English, French, German or Italian which is no more than 4 days old. You can find the certificate on the website of the Austrian Embassy in London.
If you arrive from the UK without a valid medical certificate, you must self-isolate for 14 days and be able to provide evidence of where you will quarantine. It is possible to leave quarantine early if you test negative for coronavirus while in isolation.
Coronavirus tests are available for €190 on arrival at Vienna Airport. If you wish to be tested at the airport, you must book an appointment in advance.
Entry to Austria without the need for a medical certificate or quarantine is possible for residents of Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain or Switzerland, who have spent the preceding 14 days only in those countries and not travelled elsewhere.
Transit Austria
If you’re transiting through Austria without a stopover, you do not need a medical certificate if you can prove you are transiting.
Neighbouring countries are restricting movement across borders and conducting health checks.
