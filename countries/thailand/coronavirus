Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Thailand. The Thai authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and borders
The Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand has extended the existing suspension of incoming international passenger flights until 5.00 pm on 30 April.
An Emergency Decree came into force on 26 March 2020, initially until 30 April. It means the Thai authorities have barred all foreign nationals from entering or transiting Thailand except in certain limited circumstances. If you do not meet these criteria you should not try to enter or transit Thailand:
persons on diplomatic or consular mission, or under International Organisations, representatives of governments performing their duties in Thailand or other persons or international agencies that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs gives permissions, and their families. They must have a fit-to-fly health certificate (issued no more than 72 hours before travelling) and a certificate of entry issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If suspected of carrying COVID-19, they may be denied entry into the country
non-Thai nationals with work permits or who have been granted permission from Thai government agencies to work in Thailand - They must have a fit-to-fly health certificate (issued no more than 72 hours before travelling). If suspected of carrying COVID-19, they may be denied entry into the country
persons exempted by the Prime Minister or Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, under certain conditions and for a prescribed time period
pilot-in-command and crew members – with a fixed travel schedule
carriers of necessary cargoes – they must leave the country immediately after their mission is completed
You should keep up to date with the latest information on the websites of the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand, and the Ministry of Public Health.
Transit passengers
Due to the ongoing Emergency Decree travellers are not permitted to transit Thailand, except those people listed above in ‘Entry and Borders’.
Thai authorities may introduce further measures. You can monitor the latest updates from Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health on its website, and refer to their Q&A for travellers.
British nationals in Thailand who wish to return to the the UK, should see Returning to the UK for more information.
Social measures
The Thai authorities have introduced measures that place restrictions on public gatherings. From the evening of 3 April 2020, until further notice, a nationwide curfew will be in effect daily from 10pm until 4am. The only exceptions will be medical personnel, banking sector workers, transportation of essential goods, commuting to and from the airport (with flight tickets), postal delivery, and those with official night shift duty. Violation will lead to 2 years in jail and/or 40,000 THB fine. You should follow local guidance. There have been cases of foreign nationals being arrested for breaching curfew restrictions.
All malls in Bangkok are closed from 22 March until 30 April. Supermarkets, pharmacies, sections in malls selling foodstuffs and restaurants offering takeaway service remain open, although some restrictions on opening times have been applied. All entertainment venues such as pubs and clubs, and educational institutions are closed, as are popular tourist activities. Other provinces have imposed similar restrictions. Some provinces may impose stricter measures including curfews or lockdowns on certain premises. There are screening checkpoints in place for travel between provinces. An emergency decree came into force on 26 March 2020, initially until 30 April 2020 (subject to extension). A number of measures have been outlined stating, among other instructions, that individuals must not:
enter high risk areas
hoard essential goods
attend public gatherings
propagate false information
The Thai authorities have advised the elderly (over 70 years), children (under 5 years) and those with pre-existing medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, respiratory diseases, lung diseases) not to leave their home except for essential purposes, such as buying groceries, conducting business transactions, going to a hospital or filing complaints to the police.
The Thai authorities have introduced instructions that all passengers must wear masks on all public transport. Many supermarkets and other businesses that remain open have the same requirement. The Thai Department of Disease Control linked the smoking of cigarettes to the impact of coronavirus. Smoking in public could result in a fine of up to 5,000 Baht. Electronic cigarettes are already illegal in Thailand and their use may incur further fines or imprisonment.
Since 26 March 2020 the Thai authorities have been implementing measures to deter travelling between provinces. A large proportion of internal bus and train routes are closed and there are some restrictions on travel between provinces. If you are taking an internal flight inside Thailand you are required to download the AOT Airports App and complete a T8 Travel Form. A number of regional airports, including Phuket, will soon be temporarily halting flights. There are a number of road checkpoints in place across Thailand so you should carry a passport as proof of identification when in public.
Travel within Thailand is likely to become even more difficult. Further measures may be introduced at any time. All British nationals are advised to follow the advice of the Thai authorities.
All British nationals in Thailand are advised to remain up to date with the latest health advice provided by Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health and updates from the Thai Government on the situation.
Provincial authorities may enact measures which are stricter or different to those in other areas, including making masks compulsory at all times, longer curfews or the closure of hotels and beaches. Some provinces have closed their borders entirely or are in the process of doing so including Chonburi (Pattaya) and Phuket. Some provinces, including Krabi, will ask tourists to use particular hotels.You should check you can access accommodation and the services you need for the duration of your stay and if not, make a different plan which may include returning to the UK. You should follow the advice of both national and provincial authorities.
