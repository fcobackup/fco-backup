This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Oman set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
If you are unsure if you meet the requirements (or consider you have exceptional circumstances) to enter Oman please speak to your nearest Oman Embassy and/or your sponsor in Oman.
British nationals arriving in Oman from the UK must:
present a certificate with QR code confirming a negative PCR test result (this test must be taken no more than 72 hours for flights less than 8 hours and no more than 96 hours for flights greater than 8 hours prior to arrival) or within 24 hours after arrival. Passengers aged 18 and above are required to present a COVID-19 vaccine certification containing QR code indicating that they have received at least two doses of the approved COVID-19 vaccine. (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’)
have proof of travel/health insurance which covers at least 30 days of COVID-19 treatment
If you are unvaccinated you must be able to provide proof of medical reasons preventing you from being vaccinated, otherwise you will not be permitted to enter Oman.
If you have recovered from COVID-19 and have a positive PCR test result, you will be required to show proof that you have completed the required isolation period in the country you have travelled from.
British nationals aged 18 and under are not required to show evidence of COVID-19 vaccine or PCR test. Passengers are no longer required to register vaccination certificates at MOH website.
Approved COVID-19 vaccinations in Oman are: AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria and Covishield), Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Sinovac, Sinopharm, Sputnik V and Covaxin.
If you need further clarification of the vaccine requirements for entry to Oman, you should contact your nearest Oman Embassy and, or your airline. Your airline may have rules that conflict with those set out by the Omani authorities (e.g. requiring you to provide a negative PCR test before boarding).
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Oman will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Travel by land
To cross into Oman by land, you must:
Present a certificate with QR code confirming a negative PCR test result (this test must be taken no more than 72 hours for flights less than 8 hours and no more than 96 hours for flights greater than 8 hours prior to arrival) or within 24 hours after arrival.
Passengers aged 18 and above are required to present a COVID-19 vaccine certification containing QR code indicating that they have received at least two doses of the approved COVID-19 vaccine. (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’)

Data collection
Prior to travelling, you should download the Tarassud+ track and trace application if possible.
Testing on departure
On departure you will have your temperature checked. If you show symptoms of coronavirus, you may be prevented from travelling. You must also comply with whatever the entry and testing requirements are at the country you intend to travel to.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
See ‘entry rules in response to coronavirus’ section.
British nationals can visit Oman without a visa if:
your stay is less than 14 days (no extensions);
you have evidence of a confirmed hotel booking
you have health insurance to cover your stay
you have a return ticket
For other types of visit, British nationals need a visa to enter Oman. Visit visas are available on arrival at the airport, however it is recommended that you apply for a visa before you travel. Applications can be made through the Royal Oman Police portal. If you are travelling as a tourist, you can apply for an unsponsored visa.
For all other visas, please follow the guidance on the portal or talk to your sponsor/employer in Oman.
Passport validity
Your passport should have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of entry to Oman.
Oman doesn’t recognise dual nationality. If you hold both British and Oman nationalities and this becomes known to the Omani authorities, they may confiscate your Omani or British passport.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are valid for entry, exit and transit in Oman however they must have at least 6 months’ remaining validity. Residents and tourists will need to get an exit stamp before leaving. If you are exiting on an ETD because your full validity passport has been lost or stolen, you must obtain a police report in order to exit Oman. This report can be obtained at the Lost Passport Reporting Office, Royal Oman Police Civil Status Office nearest you. You should allow sufficient time to collect this report as it can take up to two days to be processed. Without this report you may experience difficulties at the airport, including being prevented from leaving on your booked flight.
Check your passport carefully to make sure it’s legal and valid so that you don’t need an ETD.
Travelling with medication
Some prescribed and over the counter medicines available in the UK are banned substances in Oman. If you’re travelling to Oman with prescription drugs, carry a copy of the prescription. For further information, check with Oman’s Ministry of Health well in advance of travel.
