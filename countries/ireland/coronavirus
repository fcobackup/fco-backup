Across Ireland:
Physical distancing should be maintained at all times. Amongst other measures, you are advised to:
wash your hands well and often
observe good cough and sneeze etiquette
distance yourself at least 2 metres away from other people, especially those who might be unwell
limit your contact with others when out and about
keep your close contacts to a small number of people
avoid crowded areas
wear a face covering in situations where physical distancing is not possible, for example shops and shopping centres (mandatory from 10 August), busy public transport (also mandatory), or if you are meeting someone who is vulnerable to the virus
keep a log of all of your contacts throughout the day
The wearing of face coverings on public transport is mandatory. Wearing face coverings in shops and shopping centres will be mandatory from Monday 10 August . There are penalties for non-compliance, although some people are exempted from wearing masks. Wearing a cloth face covering remains recommended in other situations where it is difficult to practice social distancing. For more information, please see the Irish Government website.
There is specific guidance for people who are over 70 or extremely medically vulnerable, including to protect yourself by staying at home as much as you can. Should you wish to visit someone, receive visitors in your home, visit shops, travel and engage in other outdoor activities, it is recommended that you continue to follow the relevant public health and social distancing guidance.
The Irish Government states that as risk cannot be completely eliminated, you will need to decide what is right for you and your health. See the Irish Government website for further information, which covers relevant information for a range of different scenarios.
