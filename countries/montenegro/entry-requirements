Passport validity
If you are visiting Montenegro, your passport should be issued in the last 10 years and valid for at least 3 months after your planned date of departure from Montenegro.
If you hold dual citizenship, the Montenegrin authorities will consider you a citizen of the issuing state of the passport with which you entered Montenegro.
Visas
You can enter Montenegro for short-term stays of up to 90 days without a visa. The Montenegrin law considers “stays of 90 days” as 90 days in total in a 180-day period, counted from the first entry date.
On entering Montenegro, make sure the border police put an entry stamp in your passport. This helps avoid problems related to verifying the length of your stay in the country.
If you are in the UK the Montenegrin Embassy in London will be able to advise on what kind of visa you may need before travel to Montenegro.
If you wish to extend your stay in Montenegro, you will need to apply for a temporary residence permit from the Montenegrin Ministry of Interior Affairs no later than one week before the 90-day period expires.
Border crossings
Only enter Montenegro through recognised border crossings.
If you are planning a mountaineering tour which involves crossing borders other than at an official border crossing point, contact the National Tourist Organisation for advice.
Registration
By law you must register with the local police or tourism organisation in the town/city where you are staying within 24 hours of your arrival in Montenegro, unless you are staying in a hotel or other commercial accommodation where you’ll be registered automatically on checking in.
If you do not register you may be fined, detained or face a court appearance.
Customs requirements
The Montenegro Customs Administration advises travellers of the main regulations regarding import of food, medicines, flora and fauna species, animals, tobacco and alcoholic beverages and firearms.
Although there is no limit to the amount of money you can bring into Montenegro, you should declare sums of money in excess of €10,000 (including travellers’ cheques or equivalent in other currencies). To take more than €10,000 out of the country you will need to provide proof that you brought the money in. Customs Officers at all border points issue declaration forms. On departure, you will need to return a certified copy of this declaration to customs. For sums of money in excess of €10,000 you should also have obtained a document which states the origin of the funds. If you fail to comply with these rules, your money may be confiscated.
To avoid customs charges, declare items of value like expensive jewellery, photographic and computer equipment.
