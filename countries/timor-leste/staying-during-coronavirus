This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Timor-Leste as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Timor-Leste to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around Timor-Leste
For information on entering Timor-Leste, see Entry Requirements.
On 28 March 2020 the Timorese authorities declared a state of emergency. This prohibits all activities which involve groups of people gathering, including meetings, demonstrations, and social, religious, sporting and cultural events.
Public transport is suspended and travel is restricted within municipalities. Grocery shops, fuel stations, pharmacies, clinics, banking facilities and building material stores remain open but enforce a 1 metre minimum distance between each person
Health
Detection and treatment of the disease in Timor-Leste will be difficult, given the limited healthcare available. There is a risk that the healthcare system will come under significant strain as coronavirus spreads. Medical evacuation may not be available or be very expensive.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Timor-Leste, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
