There are currently limited commercial options available to return to the UK from New Zealand. Most commercial flights have now been suspended. In April and May, the UK operated a series of charter flights from New Zealand to help British tourists, short term visitors and their direct dependents to return to the UK. No further charter flights are planned.

Flights
If you wish to return to the UK, Air New Zealand is still flying. If flying via the U.S., the border restrictions announced on 20 April will not affect transit through Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) for British Nationals travelling from New Zealand. You should check the travel advice for the USA for the full detail on transit restrictions including the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) requirements.
Qatar Airways is also operating regular flights with Air New Zealand. These involve an Air New Zealand flight from Auckland to Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane and then onto London Heathrow via Qatar.
For transit through Australia, the Australian Department of Home Affairs website sets out requirements, including on transit visas. You can only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight leaves from the same airport. Depending on your circumstances, you may need to apply for a transit exemption before you travel to Australia. Further details can be found in our Australia Travel Advice.
Travelling to the airport
Foreign nationals in New Zealand can use public or private transport to travel to the airport in order to connect with international flights to their home country. During Alert Level 2, there are rules on how to use public transport: check the Alert Level 2 guidance for details. Further information is available on public transport in Auckland and public transport in Christchurch.
