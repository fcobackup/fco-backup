The rainy season runs from November to April. Heavy rainfall can make roads harder to pass, and make some areas impassable. Flooding is also a possibility. Monitor local reports and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation, check your routes before travelling around the country, and follow the advice of the local authorities.
