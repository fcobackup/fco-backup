Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 911 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Nicaragua
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
You cannot use British-issued prescriptions locally. To find a pharmacy (‘farmacia’), search online for the nearest big national chain, such as FarmaValue, Farmacia MEDCO, Farmacia Saba, Farmacia Kielsa, or Farmacia El Ahorro.
Healthcare in Nicaragua
Public hospitals in Nicaragua are not well equipped, except for some hospitals in Managua. Emergency medical treatment is normally free in a public hospital but you will be charged for private health care. You may have difficulties without a good understanding of Spanish.
Private hospitals usually take payment for healthcare up front and in cash. A few private hospitals will accept major credit cards. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Nicaragua where some staff will speak English.
There is also guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Nicaragua.
