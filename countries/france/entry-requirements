The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
###Border controls
Since 20 March 2020 entry to France has been limited to those transiting through France, returning French nationals and residents, and a small number of essential travel categories. The full list of categories are found on the international ‘attestation’ available in English. This document needs to be produced for entry, along with any supporting paperwork. If you are entering or transiting through France, you need to have:
an international attestation
a travel declaration to certify your reason for travel if your primary residence is more than 100km from your point of entry
a travel certificate to travel in Île-de-France (Greater Paris) on public transport at peak hours (from 06h30 to 09h30 and from 16h00 to 19h00)
Border checks are also in place on the borders with Italy, Spain, Belgium and Germany.
Certificate requirements for travel within France
If you are returning to your primary residence in France and it is more than 100km from your point of entry, you will need to travel back by the most direct route and complete a travel declaration to certify your reason for travel. This certificate can be downloaded onto smartphones or handwritten if you are unable to access a printer.
If you are currently resident in France, travel within your department of residence or up to 100km from your place of residence is permitted without restrictions. Travel beyond 100km from your place of residence is only permitted for the urgent professional or family reasons listed on the travel declaration. You will need to complete a travel declaration to certify your reason for travelling. This certificate can be downloaded onto smartphones or handwritten if you are unable to access a printer.
To travel in Île-de-France (Greater Paris) on public transport at peak hours (from 06h30 to 09h30 and from 16h00 to 19h00) you will need to complete a travel certificate from your employer to certify your reason for travel. If you are not travelling for work, you will need to self-certify that you are travelling for one of the compelling reasons listed on the certification.
