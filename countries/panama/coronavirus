Curfew elsewhere in the country
From 24th July Colon, Chiriquí and Bocas del Toro were added to the list of provinces under stricter quarantine measures. These provinces now have curfew imposed at weekends until further notice, starting at 7pm every Friday evening until 5am Monday morning. If you are arriving internationally to a location where a curfew is in effect, you will be allowed to travel to your accommodation, providing you carry proof that you have just come from a flight.
Elsewhere, a daily curfew, including weekends, is in place and you must remain in your homes/accommodation between 11pm and 5am, unless you fall under one of the exemptions (e.g. to access emergency medical care, to travel to a flight or if you work in an exempted industry).
Places of worship, parks, sports facilities and social areas (including those of buildings and open-air areas of private clubs, such as tennis courts, golf and other sporting activities that do not involve physical contact) and swimming pools are open with 25% capacity and social distancing of 2 metres. Cultural activities (such as museums, cinemas and theatres) have resumed with restrictions of 50% capacity.
The Panamanian Ministry of Health has specified that the relaxation in measures does not include social activity in groups, celebrations, beach visits, contact sports or any activity that does not respect social distancing. Gyms in apartment complexes are to remain closed.
