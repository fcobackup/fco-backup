This page has information on travelling to Uzbekistan.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Uzbekistan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Uzbekistan’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate

Vaccination certificates, PCR / antigen tests are no longer required at any points of entry - road, air, or rail.

You don’t need to provide proof of your vaccination status for entry to Uzbekistan.

If you are transiting through Uzbekistan
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Transit passengers should check the requirements for the next country they are travelling to.
If you are a tourist transiting Uzbekistan in a recreational vehicle or staying in tents/camping, you are responsible for your own registration. You should register online via the electronic registration system Emehmon within three days of arrival. During the online registration process there will be a tourist tax charge for each day of your stay. At the moment tourist tax can only be paid online by Uzbek debit card in local currency, therefore you should seek assistance from hotels or local tour operators.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are visiting Uzbekistan, your passport should be valid for three months from the date you arrive.
Visas
If you have a British citizen passport you can enter Uzbekistan as a visitor for stays of up to 30 days without a visa.
If you’re travelling on a different type of British passport, are travelling for a purpose other than tourism or business, or intending to stay longer than 30 days, you should check entry requirements with the Embassy of the Republic of Uzbekistan in London.
If you’re entering Uzbekistan on an Uzbek visa make sure that you check it once issued and carefully note the date of expiry and the number of entries permitted.
Do not overstay your visa, or exceed your permitted duration of stay, even for a very short period. Any traveller found to have overstayed will face a fine and possibly deportation. It is not always easy or possible to extend your stay or a visa if you wish to remain in the country for longer than you originally intended. If you are travelling overland, make sure you arrive at your intended border crossing in good time before your period of stay or visa expires.
For further information contact the Embassy of the Republic of Uzbekistan in London.
Registration
You must register within 3 days of arrival. Saturdays and Sundays count as part of the three day period. If you are staying in a hotel, you will be asked for your passport at check-in and it will be retained for a short period. Hotel staff will complete the registration paperwork and return your passport to you.
If staying in a private house, your host should register you with their local district OVIR (Department of Foreign Travel & Exit (they also deal with the registration of Foreign Citizens)) or on the electronic registration system Emehmon. If you travel to another city and plan to stay for longer than three days, you will need to register again. You must follow this procedure, as a full record of your whereabouts whilst in Uzbekistan is required upon departure. Visitors who are unable to account for their whereabouts could be fined and possibly deported.

Dual nationality
Dual nationality is not recognised in Uzbekistan. See Dual nationality for more information
Customs declarations
You should fill out two copies of the customs declaration form on arrival. Make sure that both copies are signed and stamped by Customs officials. You will need to present one to the customs authorities as you enter the country and produce the other on departure. Any currency or valuables found in your possession and not declared on your customs declaration form may be confiscated.
Travelling with medicines
If you enter Uzbekistan with medicines, whether prescription or non-prescription, you should check in advance the list of prohibited medicines and the legal quantities of medicines that are allowed to be imported. You can find information on the website of the State Customs Committee of Uzbekistan.
You should carry a doctor’s prescription if you intend to travel with prescription medicines and declare the items on your customs declaration form. Some non-prescription medicines in the UK cause problems on entry into Uzbekistan, including codeine. Possession of these items can lead to administrative or criminal proceedings if you don’t have a prescription, or if you’re carrying more than you need for the visit and don’t declare them on arrival. Issues have most frequently been reported at land borders.
Border crossings
