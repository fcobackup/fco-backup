The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You will need a visa to enter Sri Lanka. You can get a short stay visa online at: Electronic Travel Authority (ETA).. Tourist visas are normally issued for a maximum period of 30 days. Although it’s still possible to get a tourist visa on arrival, it’s better to get one before you travel. If you arrive in Sri Lanka without a visa, you could face delays. For the most up-to-date advice on visas check with the Sri Lankan High Commission in the UK. If you experience any difficulty with the ETA System, or if you’re travelling for paid or unpaid work, you should get a visa from the Sri Lankan High Commission before you travel.
Overstaying your visa will attract a fine and possible detention and deportation. If you have overstayed your visa, you must report to the Department of Immigration & Emigration
Visas on arrival have been suspended for all travellers arriving from Sierra Leone and Guinea.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry to Sri Lanka.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Sri Lanka.
