The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Hela and Southern Highlands provinces following significantly increased levels of tribal fighting and the declaration of states of emergency by the Papua New Guinea government.
There has also been heavier than usual tribal fighting in Enga and Western Highlands provinces following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake in February 2018. If you’re planning to travel to these provinces, you should take greater care than usual and consider enhanced security precautions.
Outbreaks of tribal violence may occur with little warning and may escalate very quickly. You should avoid large crowds and public gatherings as they may turn violent. See Local travel
