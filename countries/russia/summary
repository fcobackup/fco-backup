The 2018 FIFA World Cup is currently taking place in Russia. The FCO has put together some top travel and safety tips. Visit our Be on the Ball page for more information.
The Football Supporters’ Federation has published a guide to the tournament and what you can expect while in Russia. This includes detailed sections on each of the host cities. They have also published a match guide for the England v Belgium third place play-off on Saturday 14 July.
Fans travelling to Russia for the FIFA World Cup will need to have a FAN ID, or a visa valid for the duration of their entire trip, and should make arrangements for travel and accommodation in advance. Match tickets are sold through FIFA or national football associations. Tickets bought through unofficial means may not be valid, and ticket touts or individuals caught with forged tickets are likely to receive heavy fines.
England will play Belgium at the St Petersburg Stadium in St Petersburg on Saturday 14 July in the third place play-off. There are direct flights to St Petersburg from the UK. Like many large cities, St Petersburg has problems with traffic congestion. Journeys to/from Pulkovo Airport (23 km south of the city centre) and the St Petersburg Stadium (7 km north west of the city centre) may take longer than expected around peak times. Details of how to use public transport to get to the stadium are available here. The FIFA Fan Fest is at Konyushennaya Square in the centre of St Petersburg. Find out more about St Petersburg.
