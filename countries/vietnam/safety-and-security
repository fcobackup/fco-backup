Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad. 
Terrorism in Vietnam
Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Vietnam, attacks cannot be ruled out. 
Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreign nationals. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
Political situation
Vietnam has a single-party political system, which does not welcome people disagreeing with the government. Some protests in recent years have turned violent or been violently suppressed by the authorities. Avoid all protests.
Crime
Protecting yourself and your belongings
Pickpockets and bag-snatchers operate in crowded areas and in places visited by tourists. Take care of your belongings and consider splitting important items between bags.
Do not give your passport to others as a guarantee – for example, to motorcycle rental shops or landlords. They can hold your passport against claimed damage.
There is a risk of petty theft on buses and trains, particularly while asleep on overnight trains.
Drink spiking and sexual assault
British nationals have reported rape and sexual assaults in tourist areas and places where foreigners live. Women have also reported indecent assaults and harassment. These include inappropriate touching and groping, particularly while walking alone.
In Vietnam there is a higher burden of proof for victims than in the UK. Victims must show they did not consent, particularly if they drank alcohol or knew the alleged attacker.
There is a risk of drink spiking – do not leave your drinks unattended or accept drinks from strangers.
Job scams
Be wary of job offers that appear too good to be true. People have arrived in the Mekong region and have been illegally transported to neighbouring countries on the promise of high-paying jobs, which turn out to be scams.
There have been incidents of:
passports being confiscated by scammers
victims being held in poor living conditions
coercion into undertaking wider online scamming activity
Transfers from airports and stations
Be cautious about offers of free bus transfers to hotels, unless organised in advance. These may be scams.  
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
You must always carry photographic ID. The authorities will accept a printed copy of the photo page of your passport and visa.
Illegal drugs penalties
Penalties for possessing, distributing or manufacturing drugs are severe. You can get the death sentence if you’re found with even small amounts.
Illegal drugs are often tampered with or spiked and can be much stronger than in Europe. British nationals in Vietnam have suffered severe psychiatric problems because of drug use.
LGBT+ travellers
Vietnam is a generally tolerant and progressive place for LGBT+ travellers. There are no criminal penalties for same-sex sexual activity or changing gender. Same-sex marriage is not recognised in law.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Dress code
Respect local customs and dress in appropriate clothing when entering religious or cultural sites. This usually means covering your shoulders and knees. You’ll often see signs outside religious or cultural sites that tell you the dress code.
Money change counters
Only change money at official money exchange counters with a clear sign showing this status. Changing money elsewhere is illegal and you risk losing your money.
Rice wine
Some rice wines sold without recognised brand names can have very high and sometimes fatal levels of methanol.
Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs
It’s illegal to buy, sell, kill or collect protected wild animal or plants. If you’re caught buying or trafficking these items, you could get a fine or long prison sentence.
Restricted areas
There are restrictions on travel near military bases in Vietnam. Do not take photos near bases.
If you want to visit a village, commune or ward close to the border, you may need permission from the provincial police department. Contact the local authority for more information.
Legal system
People convicted of sex and drug offences can receive very long prison sentences or the death sentence. The Vietnamese legal system is not well developed, and the standard of prisons is very poor.
If you are under criminal investigation, you can be detained for long periods without evidence. There can be long delays before you can contact lawyers, British Embassy officials or family. Legal representation is far below UK standards.
Foreign nationals involved in traffic accidents have been stopped from leaving Vietnam until the police have completed their investigations. This process can take a long time, and foreign nationals have been asked to agree out of court financial settlements. FCDO advises you to get professional legal advice and representation if you are in this situation. See Getting help.
Internet access
There are sometimes restrictions on internet use, which can temporarily affect access to social media websites. Most social media sites are normally available.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
British nationals have died or been injured in Vietnam while engaged in adventure tourism in rural and mountainous areas.
Risks include:
dangerous terrain
remote areas that are difficult for rescue services to reach
flooding, swollen rivers and landslides, especially during the rainy season
lower safety standards than in the UK
To reduce your personal risk:
follow safety guidelines
stay on main routes
take a reputable guide – in some places it is illegal to go without a guide
use approved adventure tourism companies – check local authority websites
check weather forecasts
make sure your travel insurance covers your planned activity
Illegal tour guides have been known to offer tours and activities prohibited under local regulations.
Firearms activities
If you take part in leisure activities involving firearms, make sure a reputable guide supervises you. There is a risk of hearing loss.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Vietnam, see information on driving abroad and driving rules in Vietnam.
You’ll need to have both the 1968 version of the international driving permit and your UK driving licence with you in the car. It is illegal to drive without third-party insurance.
Do not use your passport as a deposit for hiring vehicles or as a guarantee you will pay a fine for a traffic offence.
Drink-driving is a serious offence in Vietnam. If you are tested and found to have any alcohol in your system, you may get a fine and possible imprisonment.
Compliance with road laws is poor – keep your speed down and stay alert.
If you’re involved in an accident, you could face criminal charges and may need to pay compensation to injured people, even if the injuries are minor. Offer the police your full co-operation and inform the British Embassy in Hanoi or Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City.
Motorbike safety
Travelling by motorbike in Vietnam is much riskier than in the UK. Motorbike accidents are common and have killed and injured British nationals.
Do not hire a motorbike if you’re not an experienced rider. Always:
check your motorbike thoroughly
rent from a reputable organisation
use a good helmet – it is illegal for drivers and passengers to ride without a helmet
Make sure your travel insurance covers your planned activity.
Taxis
Metered taxis from larger firms are generally reliable. Where possible get hotels or restaurants to book you a reputable taxi. Always make sure the driver identifies themself before setting off. If you book taxis using the Grab app, which is similar to Uber – you can make sure the details of the vehicle and driver match those given by the company.
Buses and coaches
Bus and coach crashes are not uncommon and are more likely at night. Vehicles are often poorly maintained. Night bus drivers may become tired but continue driving, resulting in sometimes fatal crashes.
Sea travel
Check with your tour guide about the safety record and registration of boats, and the certification of staff. Make sure you get a full safety briefing and have a life jacket when joining any boat. 
Consider safety standards carefully before taking an overnight boat trip on Halong Bay. Overcrowding and poor safety standards have led to accidents in past years. Some boats have sunk quickly and without warning.
Piracy in coastal areas of Vietnam is very rare. See piracy and armed robbery at sea for precautions you could take.
Landmines and unexploded weapons
Landmines and other unexploded weapons are a hazard in former battlefields. Areas of particular risk include central Vietnam and along the Laos border, formerly crossed by the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Mined areas are often unmarked.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Storm Prapiroon
Storm Prapiroon is approaching and may impact the east coast of Vietnam. Follow the advice of local authorities, and check with your travel provider for any disruption.
Tropical cyclones
Tropical cyclones affect the eastern coastal regions of Vietnam, with a risk of:
strong winds
heavy rainfall and flooding
disruption to transport
The season normally runs from May to November, but tropical cyclones can happen at other times. Monitor approaching storms on the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting and Japan Meteorological Agency websites. Follow the advice of the local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
Monsoon
Vietnam has a tropical monsoon climate. There can be large amounts of rain in short periods of time. Localised flooding, flash floods and landslides are common. Take care if you’re trekking in rural and mountainous areas.
