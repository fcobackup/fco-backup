The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Dominica
Dominica has published travel protocols setting out its entry requirements in relation to COVID-19. Visit the Discover Dominica website for full details. You should read these before your departure and monitor the pages on a regular basis as the requirements may change at short notice. Masks should be worn at all times during your travel to Dominica and your passage through the airport. Social distancing and hygiene protocols are in place.
Arrival with a COVID 19 negative test
All travellers from the UK must present on arrival a valid COVID-19 PCR negative test result taken no more than 72 hours in advance of your flight’s arrival. Arriving passengers must complete an online questionnaire 24 hours before arrival. The PCR test result must be uploaded and submitted with the questionnaire so that your arrival can be approved by email from the Dominican Ministry of Health. Without this email you will not be allowed to board the flight coming into Dominica.
If you are fully vaccinated (vaccinated more than 14 days prior to arrival), you should also pay XCD$100 online for the Rapid Antigen Test which you will have to undergo on arrival.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Dominica will accept the UK’s solutions to demonstrate your COVID vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Quarantine for unvaccinated arrivals from the UK
On arrival, you will undergo a health assessment and then be transported either to the government isolation facility in Portsmouth or a Safe-in Nature-certified private property for a minimum of 5 days’ quarantine, the latter at your own expense.
You will be required to undergo a second PCR test 5 days after arrival. If the result of that second test is negative, you will not be subject to further quarantine. If the result is positive, you will be transported to the government isolation facility in Portsmouth until you recover. Family groups can be kept together. The government aims to return results within 48 hours. While you are in the government isolation facility, you will need to pay for your own meals.
There are different rules for unvaccinated arrivals from some countries deemed lower risk than the UK. See the Discover Dominica website for further details.
Quarantine for vaccinated arrivals
On arrival, you will undergo a health assessment and then a Rapid Antigen Test. If this is negative, you will be considered medically cleared and no quarantine period will be required. You should, however, only use COVID-certified transportation during your holiday.
If the Rapid Antigen Test result is positive, then you will have a PCR test administered immediately. You will need to wait in the government isolation facility or a Safe in Nature-certified property until you receive the result. If negative, you will be free from quarantine. If positive, you will be transported to the government isolation facility in Portsmouth until you recover. Family groups can be kept together. You will need to pay for your meals while in the government isolation facility. See the Discover Dominica website for further details.
