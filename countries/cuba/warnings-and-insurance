Power Outage
Cuba experienced a nationwide electrical grid shutdown from 18-21 October following the failure of a major power plant. The power supply has been restored in many areas, but a schedule of outages remains in place to restrict electricity usage. In the wake of Hurricane Oscar, basic services are still affected in the East of the country.  
You should take precautions including conserving water, food, and mobile phone charge, and monitor local media for updates, including on power cut schedules.
