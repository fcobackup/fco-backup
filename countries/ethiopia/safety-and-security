Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Ethiopia.

Terrorism  
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad. 
Terrorism in Ethiopia
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Ethiopia.
Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners, such as: 
restaurants, hotels, bars and markets 
stations and airports 
places of worship and tourist attractions 
festivals and sports venues  
Large crowds are common on key national and religious dates, including: 
Ethiopian Christmas on 7 January  
Epiphany or ’Timket’ in January  
Victory of Adawa on 2 March 
Ethiopian Patriots’ Victory Day on 5 May 
Downfall of the Derg Regime on 28 May  
Ethiopian New Year from 11 to 12 September  
Birthday of the Prophet Mohammed on 27 September  
Finding of the True Cross or ‘Meskel’ on 28 September 
Ethiopian (Orthodox) Easter  
Eid Al Fitr  
Eid Al Arafa 
Parts of the country also have local festivals (often celebrating saints’ days) which can lead to large gatherings. 
Terrorist group Al-Shabaab, based in Somalia, poses a threat across East Africa. The group threatens all countries who have military forces in Somalia, including Ethiopia. In 2022, Al-Shabaab attacked the Somali towns of Aato, Yeed and Washaaqo, near the border with Ethiopia. Al-Shabaab has said it intends to commit further attacks in the area.
Political situation 
Conflict and violence  
Between November 2020 and November 2022, conflict took place in the northern regions of Ethiopia, in particular in Tigray but also in Amhara and Afar.
The Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front signed a peace agreement to cease hostilities in Tigray in November 2022. Disarmament and reconstruction measures have begun. The situation in Tigray is still fragile and there may still be isolated armed incidents. 
In August 2023, a state of emergency was imposed after conflict started between Amhara militia groups (Fano) and the Ethiopian National Defence Force. Conflict continues in Amhara region.  
There have been increased tensions and violence between armed groups and the security forces across Oromia region. 
Unrest can occur with no notice. There are ongoing armed clashes between ethnic groups. Foreigners have not been targeted. However you should: 
monitor local media 
follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator 
reconsider travel to affected areas 
Avoid large gatherings and demonstrations. Comply with the law, including in relation to carrying ID cards, and possession of foreign currency and weapons. Avoid confrontation and follow the instructions of the authorities. 
Strikes and protests
Because of frequent civil unrest, including protests and strikes, there is frequently:
temporary closure of roads, internet and mobile networks
disruption to local businesses and transport
In the past some protests have escalated into serious violence. 
Kidnap 
Kidnapping is widespread in parts of Ethiopia, with incidents in Oromia, Somali region and on the southern border with Kenya.
There have been a number of recent kidnappings in Oromia, and especially within the Adama special Zone south of Addis Ababa, and western areas of Oromia region, particularly West Wollega, East Wollega and Qellem Wollega zones.
Possible targets for kidnap include people engaged in humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors.
When arranging meetings, use a secure location. Avoid regular patterns of travel and aim to only travel during daylight hours.
Detention of British nationals 
There have been a small number of cases of arbitrary detention of British nationals in Ethiopia. The risk may increase if tensions are heightened around major events, or in locations that are sensitive for security reasons. Carry photocopies of your passport and contact details of the British Embassy Addis Ababa in case you are questioned or detained. Your physical passport is not necessary.
Ethiopian authorities do not always notify embassies when foreign nationals are detained. Even if requested, adequate consular access is not always provided. If authorities do not inform the embassy, ask family or friends to contact the British Embassy.
Crime
Foreign nationals can be targeted by groups of youths through pickpocketing and scams. 
Theft and mugging is on the rise. There has been a smaller number of more serious incidents, including sexual harassment of women. Violent robberies can occur in parks and walking sites in Addis Ababa. 
Protecting your belongings 
Take care of your belongings when visiting crowded public places, especially at night. Be vigilant if strangers approach you. Criminal gangs use distraction techniques including begging, spitting, spilling food and drink, and feigning illness.  
There is a risk of pickpocketing, bag and jewellery snatching, including from vehicles at traffic lights. 
When travelling in vehicles, you should: 
keep belongings with you 
keep valuables out of sight 
keep vehicle doors locked 
park in well-lit and guarded areas such as hotels, government and tourist locations, which all have security at their entrances 
consider fitting anti-shatter film to all windows (we do not recommend short term visitors modify their hire vehicles) 
If threatened, hand over valuables without resistance. 
Laws and cultural differences 
Health and safety 
Health and safety precautions like life jackets in boats or protective railings at historical sites are rarely in place in Ethiopia. 
Date and time 
Traditionally Ethiopia has a different calendar and way of expressing time than are widely used internationally.  
Most hotels and larger organisations’ documents, including airline tickets, use the international calendar and clock. However: 
official documents are often dated using the Ethiopian calendar 
individuals and smaller organisations might use the Ethiopian clock 
Money 
Ethiopia is a cash-based society. Banking facilities, including card payments and ATMs are limited, especially outside of cities. It is not normally possible to get a cash advance. Make sure you have enough cash before leaving cities. 
Illegal drugs and prison sentences 
Drug offences are treated seriously in Ethiopia. Possession of drugs can lead to prison sentences of 5 to 10 years and potentially large fines.  
Khat is legal in Ethiopia but it is illegal to take it out of the country. Bags are regularly searched at Addis Ababa Bole Airport. Anyone found with khat is likely to be prosecuted.
Alcohol
There are no restrictions on buying or possessing alcohol. This includes the predominantly Muslim regions although it may be more difficult to obtain.   
Religious customs 
Ethiopia is religiously diverse and largely tolerant. However, many people are devout in their faith. Take care to not offend local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Dress conservatively and observe local customs. Take particular care if travelling: 
during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan 
to religious sites of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church 
outside Addis Ababa, particularly in rural areas 
Ramadan is individually observed but there are no official regulations imposed. 
Women travellers 
Women are expected to dress conservatively, especially when visiting religious sites. 
LGBT+ travellers 
Same-sex acts (applying to both sexes) are illegal and carry penalties of between 1 and 15 years imprisonment. It is reported that the local authorities are intimidating owners and clients of hotels, bars and restaurants in Addis Ababa where same-sex activity is alleged to take place.
The public are not generally accepting of same-sex relationships. Some religious leaders have called for violence against the LGBT+ community. Be aware of local laws and customs. Showing affection in public may receive unwanted attention.  
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers. 
Imports and exports 
You need an export certificate to take antiques out of the country. Without one your items are likely to be confiscated and you could be prosecuted. 
Owning ivory is illegal. British nationals have had ivory jewellery confiscated and been fined up to 25,000 Ethiopian birr. 
Using cameras in secure areas 
It is illegal to take photos: 
near military zones or of military personnel 
near the Presidential Palace in Addis Ababa 
where signs prohibit photography 
Satellite phones and binoculars 
Satellite phones and binoculars cannot be imported or exported to or from Ethiopia without prior approval from the Customs and Information Network and Security Agency. Get advice from your travel provider on permissions required.
Unapproved items can be confiscated by authorities, with the possibility of being able to collect them on departure from Ethiopia, but this is not guaranteed. 
Drones 
The importation and use of drones within Ethiopia is subject to permission by the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority and Information Network and Security Agency. Without written clearance drones can be subject to confiscation at airports or borders. 
Transport risks
Rural areas  
When travelling outside Addis Ababa, avoid driving after dark. Vehicles often have no lights and livestock may roam on roads.  
There have been instances where buses from one region have been attacked when passing through another.  
Medical facilities outside the capital are extremely limited so carry a comprehensive medical pack. 
While mobile telephone services are increasingly widespread, connectivity cannot be guaranteed. Mobile internet can be closed down with no notice. 
You might want to consider travelling in a group and leaving details of your travel itinerary with a reliable person. 
Cars and motorbikes  
Driving standards and vehicle maintenance are often poor and traffic accidents happen regularly, especially in Addis Ababa and on the Addis Ababa-Djibouti road.  
Drivers involved in car accidents can face severe punishments, including custodial sentences and fines. If you’re involved in a traffic accident, stay in your vehicle and call the local police. Avoid confrontation and wait for police to arrive to deal with any issues. 
Localised demonstrations have led to temporary road closures or the targeting of public transport. However, not all social media reports of such disruptions are accurate. If unsure, contact local authorities or reputable tour operators in the areas you’re travelling to. 
If you meet a roadblock, follow advice of local authorities if they are present. If you encounter an unattended roadblock, turn around and do not attempt to pass it.
