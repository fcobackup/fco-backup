Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Afghanistan.

The FCDO advises against all travel to Afghanistan.
If you choose to travel to Afghanistan against FCDO advice, monitor media reporting and make sure you have robust contingency plans in place. Be vigilant at all times, keep others informed including family and friends of your travel plans and consider your necessary routes in advance.
Detention
There is a heightened risk of British nationals being detained in Afghanistan. If you are a British national and you are detained in Afghanistan, you could face months or years of imprisonment. The FCDO’s ability to provide consular assistance is extremely limited and cannot be delivered in person within Afghanistan. The FCDO’s ability to secure information from the authorities could also be severely limited and you may not be able to contact your next of kin.
The British government will have very limited ability to help you if you get into difficulty in Afghanistan. If you are a British national already resident in Afghanistan, you should carefully consider the risk to  your safety and security from staying  there.
If you choose to travel to or stay in Afghanistan against FCDO advice, you should not rely on previous experience of travelling in Afghanistan or previous understanding of rules, laws and society. British nationals with previous experience of operating in Afghanistan have been detained in the country since August 2021.
If you are found in possession of:
weapons
explosives
tracking devices
items that may be considered unusual
large quantities of money
Or if:
you have worked in the military
you have connections to previously detained British nationals
The Taliban are likely to suspect you of spying and may detain you. If you are found guilty of espionage or working to undermine Afghanistan’s national security, the punishment may be execution. The Taliban are suspicious of foreigners working or travelling in Afghanistan, including humanitarian workers and journalists, and it’s likely your work and movements will be closely monitored.
Foreign nationals have been detained in Afghanistan without due process. Detention can be lengthy, damaging to health and welfare, and of uncertain outcome. You should avoid any activity which could be interpreted as seeking to achieve political change in Afghanistan through violence, or any activity inciting violence.
Sensitive sites and using cameras
You may come under suspicion if you are near sensitive sites, have contact with people who are of interest to the authorities for any reason, or are taking photographs, including of locations or people that may not appear sensitive. It may not be immediately clear when taking photos could cause offence or suspicion. Avoid photographing local people without their agreement and pay close attention to local information and ways of doing things. Photographing certain buildings in Afghanistan is not allowed and may lead to detention, including:
government buildings
military installations
palaces
Protests
The current conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories has led to protests in Afghanistan that may turn violent. Be vigilant, avoid demonstrations and take appropriate security precautions.  
Human trafficking is illegal. Under the UK Bribery Act 2010 it is an offence to offer, promise or give bribes anywhere in the world.
Political situation
Afghanistan is now under Taliban control.
People have been detained for involvement in demonstrations and for activities perceived as dissent. Foreigners’ activities are viewed with suspicion. You should not do anything which could be interpreted as seeking to achieve political change through violence, or any activity inciting violence.
The political situation remains uncertain and could change rapidly. Keep up to date with developments about the security situation, including through monitoring local media.
Road travel
Road travel is highly dangerous.
The situation at Afghanistan’s border crossings remains volatile. A number of borders remain closed and if opened, can be subject to unannounced closures at short notice. There have been clashes between Afghan and neighbouring forces at various border crossings.
We advise against all travel to and around Afghanistan.
Air travel
There are no Afghan airlines that meet UK safety standards. The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in Afghanistan that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority.
