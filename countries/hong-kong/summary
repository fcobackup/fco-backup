In recent months, large-scale political demonstrations have taken place throughout Hong Kong. Protests have affected many areas, including those popular with tourists. While a number of peaceful activities have taken place, many other protests have led to clashes between police and protesters involving significant violence. Reports suggest a number of protests are likely to take place on the days leading up to 1 October, including:
on the afternoons of 28 and 29 September in Causeway Bay and Admiralty.
on the afternoon of 1 October from Victoria Park to Central.
The situation around protests and public gatherings can change quickly, with the potential for violence, especially during unauthorised protests. Unauthorised protests have been met by a more rapid and severe police response, including heavy use of tear gas, bean bag rounds and “sponge grenades”. Police have also deployed water cannon and, occasionally, rubber bullets. Protests can deviate from planned routes or rally locations and spill over into nearby public spaces, such as shopping centres, housing estates and public transport hubs. If you’re in an area where demonstrations are taking place, you should remain vigilant, follow the advice of local authorities and move away quickly to a safe place if there are signs of disorder.
Demonstrations may lead to sections of the city being closed off and road blocks being set up. During recent protests, local buses, metro (MTR), Airport Express services and the Hong Kong Macao Ferry Terminal have temporarily suspended operations without warning. Violent protests have also taken place inside or near MTR stations. You should remain vigilant at all times and check live service updates on the MTR website.
Protests and violent clashes at Hong Kong International Airport have previously resulted in mass cancellations of flights in and out of Hong Kong. Further disruption is possible if protests return to the airport or its transport links. If you’re due to travel, check your flight status regularly, keep up to date with the latest developments via local media and consider allowing extra time to travel to the airport and complete check-in procedures.
There are reports of greater scrutiny from mainland authorities at border crossings between the mainland and Hong Kong at this time, including checks on travellers’ electronic devices. You should be aware that the thresholds for detention and prosecution in China differ from those in Hong Kong.
