Luxembourg Airport (Findel) remains open on a limited basis. Most flights are cancelled but some airlines including British Airways to London Heathrow are operating a skeleton service. Occasional flights to the UK may be available. You should consult the airline websites for further detail.
We advise British travellers who are currently in Luxembourg and who wish to return to the UK to make travel plans to do so as soon as possible. Travellers wishing to return should contact their travel operator, checking the website of their airlines, train company or ferry companies for further advice.
