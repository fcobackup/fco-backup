Local laws reflect that Iraq is a predominantly Islamic country. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religious customs at all times, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or when visiting places of religious significance.
In 2020, the holy month of Ramadan is expected to start on 23 April and finish on 23 May. See Travelling during Ramadan
Although homosexuality is not illegal under Iraqi law, the LGBT community generally keeps a low profile, making it difficult to assess its size or relative freedoms. Local attitudes towards LGBT people may be hostile. There have also been reports of individuals being targeted by extremists. You’re advised to exercise discretion. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
