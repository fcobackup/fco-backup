There have been sporadic marches and protests in Lomé and around the country since August 2017, over demands to restore the 1992 constitution. The government has banned protests, but opposition groups have announced protests for 11, 12 and 14 April in Lomé. You should remain vigilant during these times, avoid crowds and demonstrations and monitor local media. See Safety and security
Tensions remain heightened and further marches and protests, by supporters of the government and opposition are likely.
Terrorist attacks in Togo can’t be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be vigilant, especially in places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism.
