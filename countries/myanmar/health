Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Prescriptions from the UK are not accepted in pharmacies in Myanmar. Pharmaceutical products for sale could be counterfeit.

The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare in Myanmar
The Myanmar public health sector is under severe strain. Private medical facilities continue to operate. In areas where an overnight curfew is in place, such as Yangon, you may struggle to access emergency healthcare during the night.
You’re unlikely to find competent medical advice and treatment easily outside Yangon and Mandalay, and any services provided will not be to the standard of those in the UK. Evacuation is likely to be necessary for serious illness or injury.
You’ll usually need to make cash payments up front to get medical treatment in Myanmar. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. The UK government cannot pay for medical expenses overseas.
