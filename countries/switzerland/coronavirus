Local measures
The Swiss Government have implemented “extraordinary measures” in response to coronavirus (COVID-19).
Gatherings of more than 5 people are banned, excluding families and members of the same household.
All contact with other individuals should be kept to a minimum, and a distance of 2 metre should be maintained at all times.
The public are strongly advised to stay at home and employers urged to allow staff to work from home.
The Swiss Government has started a phased relaxation of these measures. All shops, restaurants, markets, museums and libraries are now able to reopen with social distancing measures in place.
