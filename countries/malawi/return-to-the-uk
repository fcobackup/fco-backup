There are currently extremely limited commercial flights from Malawi to the UK. The British High Commission is in contact with airlines and local authorities to explore commercial options to help British travellers return to the UK from Malawi as soon as possible.
Land borders remain open for Malawi nationals and residents only.

Future Travel Options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
