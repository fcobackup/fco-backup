There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Thailand.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Thailand, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Thailand because commercial routes are operating.
Flights
Seats are still regularly available on flights from Bangkok to the UK. You can get weekly updates on these by registering with the British Embassy at Thailand.Registration@fco.gov.uk. To allow resources to be focused on those who need it, please email this address to de-register once you are safely back in the UK.
You should aim to get to the airport at least 2 hours before the flight is due to depart, earlier if you are on standby.
Check the policies your airline and insurance provider have about coronavirus, including whether special requirements are in place such as providing a medical health certificate during the check-in procedure.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
A nationwide curfew is in force between 11pm and 4am each day. People travelling to the airport are exempt, but you may be stopped and asked to show proof that you have a flight. Make sure you have your boarding pass or flight booking. The Embassy can provide a movement support letter to help you travel to the airport, email Bangkok.documentaryservices@fco.gov.uk.
Domestic air travel options within Thailand are opening up but remain limited. If you intend to leave Thailand and need to take a domestic flight to reach your international airport, you should check with your provider and make plans now.
Some provinces have closed their provincial borders or imposed other internal restrictions. Some bus, train and boat routes are also closed. Make sure that you can get to your international departure airport, travelling sooner than planned if necessary. If you’re having difficulties and need help to reach your international departure airport, register at Bangkok.documentaryservices@fco.gov.uk.

The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
