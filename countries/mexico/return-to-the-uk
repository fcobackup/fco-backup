Please note that some airlines are imposing their own additional restrictions on travelers, different from the Mexican government guidelines. These restrictions may apply for domestic and international flights. Review the airline requirements carefully before purchasing any flights and before you travel.
The land border between the US and Mexico will close at midnight on Saturday 21st March to all non-essential traffic for 30 days. This closure applies primarily to tourism and recreational travel. Cargo, trade and healthcare workers will still be able to cross the border. Please check with your closest US Embassy/Consulate before attempting to cross the border.
