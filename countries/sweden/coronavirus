Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Sweden. The Swedish authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
British nationals in Sweden should follow the advice of the Swedish authorities.
British nationals visiting Sweden should be aware that travel options to and from the country are now limited due to coronavirus related restrictions. For information on how to return to the UK from Sweden, see Return to the UK
Entry and borders
Countries neighbouring Sweden (Denmark, Norway and Finland) have also introduced restrictions. The Danish Government announced that it was closing its borders for a month as of 1100 GMT on Saturday 14 March. Those normally living and working in Denmark will still be able to enter the country from Sweden. In addition, those who need to transit through Denmark in order to return to their place of residence will be able to. However tourists and those the Danish authorities say cannot demonstrate a recognised purpose (residence, work, delivery of goods, transit) to enter Denmark will not be allowed to cross the border. There may be further updates to how these policies take effect as the Danish and local authorities implement this ruling over coming days.
Local measures
The Swedish Public Health Agency is encouraging people not to travel within Sweden. Upper secondary schools, colleges and universities have suspended normal teaching in favour of distance learning. Public gatherings of more than 500 people are banned. The government encourages remote working. The elderly are recommended to stay at home, and relatives asked not to visit.
