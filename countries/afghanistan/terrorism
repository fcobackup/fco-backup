Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Multiple threats are issued daily. Terrorists and insurgents conduct frequent and widespread lethal attacks against Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF), domestic and international political and civilian targets including within the city gates, and those working in the security, humanitarian and reconstruction fields. You should note an overall increased threat to Western interests in Kabul, including from high-profile, large-scale attacks.
Past incidents include:
on 8 May 2021, explosions near a school in Kabul killed 85 people, predominately female students, and injured nearly 150 people
on 30 April 2021, explosions in Pul-e-Alam, capital of Logar Province, killed 30 people and injured 90 more people
on 24 November 2020, a terrorist attack killed at least 17 people and injured over 50 people with two explosions in Bamian city market
on 21 November 2020, a terrorist attack launched several rockets aimed at the Green Zone, stated to have been targeting both foreign and government officials
on 2 November 2020, a terrorist attack targeted a building within the Kabul University complex, killing at least 19 civilians and wounding 12 people

on 25 March 2020, a terrorist attack targeted a Sikh Gurdwara in Kabul city, killing 25 and wounding at least another eight people
on 18 October 2019, a suicide bomber targeted a mosque in Deh Bala, Nagarhar, killing 69 and wounding 36 people.
on 18 August 2019, a suicide bomber struck at a Shia wedding ceremony in the west of Kabul, killing 63 people and wounding more than 180 other people.
on 7 August 2019, a suicide vehicle based device struck a police location in Kabul city, killing 14 and injuring 145, 92 of whom were civilians
The insurgency has a strong anti-Western focus; this could make any UK interest or person a target. Attacks include bombs (roadside and other), suicide bombs (either on foot or by vehicle), indirect fire (rockets and mortars), direct fire (shootings and rocket propelled grenades), kidnappings and violent crime. Daesh continue to be a serious threat. They are fiercely hostile to the UK and other western countries.
If you decide to travel to Afghanistan, you should read this section in conjunction with the Safety and Security section.
You should be particularly vigilant on public or religious holidays, in and around landmark locations and places where large public crowds can gather. Hotels used by the government of Afghanistan and western nationals, ministries, military establishments, airports (including Kabul International) and religious sites have been attacked and further attacks are possible. Installations and life support facilities have been subject to attacks in recent years, specifically for their link to Western countries. Avoid regular visits to public places frequented by foreigners, including hotels, restaurants, shops and market places, especially at times of day when they are particularly busy and congested.
The British Embassy does not allow official visitors to stay in any hotel overnight, and has placed restaurants off limits to staff. Make sure your accommodation is secure, and review your security measures regularly.
Kidnap
The risk of being kidnapped throughout Afghanistan remains a very high and constant threat. At least four foreign nationals have been kidnapped in Kabul since July 2016, some of whom remain in captivity:
in January 2020, an international commercial contractor was kidnapped in Kabul or in a nearby province: the victim remains missing
on 2 August 2018, 3 international workers were killed shortly after kidnap in Kabul
Over 100 westerners have been kidnapped in Afghanistan since 2001, a number of them have been British nationals. The motivation and desire to undertake kidnapping in Afghanistan is likely to continue. You should take the utmost care, vary routines and avoid setting regular patterns of movement. You should take professional security advice while in the country.
Those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid and some other development work, journalism or business sectors are viewed as legitimate targets. If you’re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.
The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.
Regions
The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advise against all travel to the whole of Afghanistan.
Kabul
The FCDO advise against all travel to Kabul’s Enhanced Security Zone and Hamid Karzai International Airport, and against all travel to all other areas within the city of Kabul.
You should note an overall increased threat to Western interests in the capital. There’s an ongoing threat from high-profile, large-scale attacks.
If you’re travelling in Kabul, take particular care on Airport road, Jalalabad road and Darulaman road. Avoid travelling on Jalalabad and Darulaman roads during commuter or other busy times (around 7am to 9am and 3pm to 4pm local time), when traffic can be heaviest and the risk of an attack against government and western people or interests is most likely. Avoid travelling along Airport road as attacks are likely throughout the day.
Northern Afghanistan
The FCDO advise against all travel to Faryab, Jowzjan, Baghlan, Takhar, Kunduz, Badakhshan, Sar-e-pul, Balkh and Samangan provinces.
There have been a number of attacks against aid workers and military vehicles resulting in deaths and injuries, and there are ongoing military operations throughout the north. The FCDO advice against all travel to Badakhshan includes travel to or climbing and trekking within the Wakhan Corridor.
On 10 November 2020, the district headquarters in Almar, Faryab province was attacked with one VBIED and follow-up small arms fire. Four people were killed and another 13 were wounded during the incident.
On 8 February 2017, six Afghan staff of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were shot and killed in Jowzjan Province, Afghanistan. Two further staff members travelling in the same convoy are so far unaccounted for.
Eastern Afghanistan
The FCDO advise against all travel to Ghazni, Kapisa, Khost, Kunar, Laghman, Logar, Nangarhar, Nuristan, Paktika, Wardak, Paktya and Parvan provinces, Bamian province and the province of Panjshir.
The eastern region has been extremely volatile for some time, with almost daily suicide and roadside bomb attacks, shootings and rocket attacks. The region close to the Pakistani border is extremely dangerous with a high number of insurgents operating freely.
On 2 August 2020, a Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED) detonated at the entrance to Jalalabad prison. An armed assault team then stormed the prison, reportedly taking control of security posts within the premises. Several hundred prisoners escaped although reporting suggests a number of these have since been recaptured. At least 39 people were killed and over 50 wounded including civilians, and members of the ANDSF. A number of attackers were killed during the assault which lasted more than 18 hours. ISKP subsequently claimed responsibility for the attack.
There are regular, large military operations in this region. There have been numerous daily attacks against Afghan and non-Afghan forces. There are also daily incidents of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), suicide and rocket attacks, and direct fire attacks on security forces patrols, checkpoints and bases as well as on the local population.
On 21 January 2019, insurgents attacked a military compound in Maidan Shar, with an estimated death toll of over 100.
The 24 November 2020 terror attack in the provincial capital of Bamian was the first major attack in the city, home to a large Shi’a community, in nearly 20 years.
Southern Afghanistan
The FCDO advise against all travel to Helmand, Kandahar, Nimroz, Uruzgan and Zabul provinces.
The southern region of Afghanistan remains extremely volatile, with regular suicide and roadside bomb attacks, shootings and rocket attacks. Helmand and Kandahar see the highest number of attacks in this particularly restive area of Afghanistan.
On 8 November 2020, the District ANP Headquarters was the target of a VBIED attack in Maiwand district, Kandahar province. The blast resulted in the death of three members of the ANDSF and eight Afghan civilians. Another 20 people were wounded by the blast.
On 22 October 2020, at least 20 members of the ANDSF were killed and a number taken hostage following an insurgent attack targeting an Afghan National Army base in Delaram, Nimroz province.
Western Afghanistan
The FCDO advise against all travel to Badghis, Farah, Herat, Ghowre and Daykondi provinces.
There have been roadside bombs, suicide attacks, rocket attacks and criminal kidnappings throughout the western provinces and increased lawlessness in Western Ghowr. There is little security infrastructure in Daykondi and westerners have been kidnapped there.
On 11 January 2019, insurgents stormed the police headquarters in Herat city, killing 5 and wounding 4. On 19 May, an explosive device hit Iranian civil engineers and their protection detail working on a railway project, killing 2 and injuring 7. On 31 July, an explosion on a bus in Farah Province killed at least 27 people and wounded 17.
