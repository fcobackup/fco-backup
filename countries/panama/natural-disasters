Earthquakes
There is a possibility of earthquakes in Panama. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake or tsunami.
Hurricane/Rainy Season
The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to November; although Panama is not directly impacted by hurricanes, this season frequently coincides with heavy rains, which may cause flash floods and landslides. October and November normally have the heaviest months of rainfall. Monitor local and international weather forecasts and follow local advice.
