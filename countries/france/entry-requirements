Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Border controls
From 15 June 2020, travellers arriving in France from the UK and wider European Area (EU, Andorra, Holy See, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino and Switzerland) are no longer required to demonstrate their travel is essential or hold an international travel certificate.
Arrivals from outside the UK and wider European Area will still need to complete an international travel certificate, which certifies that your journey is essential and confirms that you have not been suffering from a set of listed symptoms associated with Covid-19. This travel certificate is available on the French Ministry of the Interior’s website. You should also produce any supporting paperwork to substantiate the essential nature of your travel.
If you are entering or transiting through France, depending on your circumstances, you also need to have a travel certificate if travelling in Île-de-France (Greater Paris) on public transport at peak hours (from 06:30 to 09:30 and from 16:00 to 19:00).
Arrivals from the UK, from Spain (air arrivals only, until 21 June) and from outside the European Area are asked to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival in mainland France. This does not apply to arrivals from the wider European Area. Full details and a list of exemptions to self-quarantine in France are set out in a Ministry of Interior press statement (in French) and its translation (in English).
Travellers showing signs of a Covid-19 infection upon arrival in mainland France will have to carry out a mandatory 14 day quarantine at home or in a dedicated location indicated by the French authorities if home quarantine is not feasible.
All travellers to French overseas territories will also have to carry out a mandatory 14 day quarantine.
Border checks may also be in place at points on France’s land borders with Italy, Spain, Belgium and Germany.
Travel between the EU and non-European countries
On 16 March, the French Government announced that the EU would suspend travel between the EU and non-European countries for an initial period of 30 days, this remains in force until further notice.
Some countries are imposing a compulsory period of quarantine for travellers from France. If you are travelling from or through France, check the situation at your destination before you travel.
Travel between metropolitan France and French overseas territories
Regular flights between metropolitan France and its overseas territories - including Martinique, Mayotte, Guadeloupe, Guyana, La Reunion, French Polynesia, Saint Martin and Saint-Barthelemy - have been suspended since 23 March. Journeys between the islands are also prohibited, except in exceptional circumstances.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.

Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter France. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in France guide and contact the French Embassy if you have further questions.
