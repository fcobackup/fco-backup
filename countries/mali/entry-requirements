This page has information on travelling to Mali.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Mali set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Mali’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
Following the military takeover in neighbouring Niger in July 2023, regional land and air travel has been affected. Some flights are being cancelled at short notice, so please check with your airline before departure.
