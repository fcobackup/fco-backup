There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Guyana.
The Government of Guyana has announced the cancellation of all international flights from Cheddi Jagan International Airport at Timehri and the Eugene Correia Airport at Ogle. The closure started on 17 March 2020 and is scheduled to last for the foreseeable future.
The flight which departed on 7 May will be the only UK organised special flight from Guyana.
The Governments of Brazil and Suriname have both announced the closure of borders with neighbouring countries, including Guyana. There is no exit/entry available to Venezuela.
Future travel options
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Guyana. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Guyana authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. If you are a British national in Guyana or Suriname and wish to leave, you should contact the British High Commission by email returnfrom.guyana@fco.gov.uk, who will inform you as soon as departure options become available.
Where possible, the British High Commission in Guyana will share relevant information about departure options on Facebook.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:

are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
