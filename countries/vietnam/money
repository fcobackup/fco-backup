The local currency is Vietnam Dong (VND).
Only change money at official money exchange counters with a clear sign showing this status. Changing money elsewhere is illegal and while higher rate may be on offer you may risk losing your money.
Credit cards are widely accepted but, in rural areas particularly, you should carry cash as a back-up. It may be difficult to cash travellersâ€™ cheques.
ATMs are widely available in major cities and tourist areas.
You can have funds transferred to Vietnam via international money transfer companies like Western Union or Moneygram.
If you plan to take money out of Vietnam, you can take out amounts of less than 15 million in Vietnamese dong or USD5000 (or equivalent in other foreign currencies) without declaring this. Any amount in excess of this will need to be declared to Customs at the airport. You must also present one of the following documents:
confirmation of carrying foreign currency or Vietnamese dong in cash abroad, issued by an authorized credit institution in accordance with the current provision of the laws on foreign exchange control
written approval to carry foreign currency or Vietnamese dong in cash abroad, issued by the State Bank of Vietnam
