Measures are in place throughout Portugal to control the spread of the virus. These measures differ according to the level of risk in each municipality. There are four levels of risk: moderate, high, very high and extremely high. Check the level of risk in your municipality and use this tool (in Portuguese) to confirm the measures that may affect you.
Nationwide measures
Subject to the restrictions in your municipality and the rules on social distancing, hand hygiene and the use of face coverings, most shops and services, restaurants, cultural venues and sports facilities are open. Opening and closing times may vary between municipalities.
Your temperature can be measured on entry to workplaces, schools, public transport, shopping centres, cultural venues and sports facilities. You will be denied entry if you refuse the test or your temperature is over 38ºc.
You can be asked to produce a negative COVID-19 test for access to healthcare facilities, schools, residential homes, prison centres and other places, as determined by the health authorities
Obligation to remain at home
If you live or are staying in one of the high risk municipalities, there is a mandatory requirement to remain at home as follows:
High-risk municipalities:
On weekdays and weekends from 11pm to 5am
Very high and extremely high-risk municipalities :

The Azores
The regional government has implemented a regional state of alert. The islands of Santa Maria, São Miguel, Terceira, Pico and Faial are in a state of calamity. The islands of Graciosa, São Jorge, Flores and Corvo are in a state of contingency.
Measures are in place throughout the archipelago to limit the spread of the virus. Details can be found on the regional government’s website. You will need to access this website through a chrome browser.
Inter-island travel
You should only travel between islands if your journey is essential. If you have to travel and you are travelling from São Miguel or Terceira to any of the other islands in the archipelago, you will need to
have a negative RT-PCR COVID-19 test from, at most, 72 hours before you travel and show the negative result when you board, and
complete a passenger questionnaire before you depart
If you live in the Azores, you should only travel internationally if your journey is essential.
Face coverings
On mainland Portugal and in the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores, you must wear a face mask in enclosed spaces, such as on public transport, in taxis and private hire, at airports and other transport hubs, in supermarkets and shops, museums and cinemas, in the public areas of hotels and in restaurants and cafes (except when you are seated at a table). You should wear your face covering when you enter the building and keep it on until you leave.
On mainland Portugal and in the Azores, you must also wear a face mask outdoors where it is not possible to maintain a 2m social distance from people outside your family group. In Madeira and Porto Santo, the use of a face mask outdoors is mandatory, except when driving, exercising, while on the beach or walking the recommended routes in forest and mountain areas.
These measures apply to everyone over the age of 10 on mainland Portugal and in the Azores, and over the age of 5 in Madeira and Porto Santo.
You can be fined up to €500 if you breach the regulations.
You may be exempt from using a face mask both indoors and out on medical grounds. You will have to show a declaration from your doctor as evidence that you have a health condition that prevents you from wearing a face covering. You should observe strict social distancing and limit the time you spend in common areas in enclosed spaces. For further information (in Portuguese) on exemptions, see decree-law 24-A/2020 (Article 13 a and b).

If you have a UK prescription, take it to a pharmacy and ask the pharmacist whether they can dispense your medication for you.
