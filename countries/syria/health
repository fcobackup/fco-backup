Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Syria.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Emergency services in Syria have been severely impacted due to the 14-year conflict and could be unresponsive.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment. 
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Syria
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Syria, including:
cholera
malaria
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Syria. Read more about altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
Healthcare in Syria
The quality of healthcare has deteriorated significantly due to conflict. Health facilities have been destroyed or damaged, many hospitals and clinics are no longer operating and there are shortages of even the most basic medicines and medical supplies. There are regular outbreaks of infectious diseases across the country. This is particularly true in rural areas.
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
