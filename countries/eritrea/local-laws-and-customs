Photographing government buildings and military installations is not allowed. If in doubt, ask first. You need a permit to take photographs of the ‘tank graveyard’ in Asmara. You can apply for one at the Ministry of Tourism.
Internet access is highly restricted in Eritrea, mainly limited to hotels and a small number of internet cafes. Telephone networks are often unreliable and may only work for limited periods each day outside Asmara and larger towns. There are no agreements between Eritrean and international mobile telephone providers: international SIM cards will not work in Eritrea. There is no 3G in the country. A resident’s permit is required to buy a local SIM card and this can take several weeks. There have been unconfirmed reports that phone calls made on the local mobile phone network are recorded.
All electronic items (laptops, mobile phones, cameras etc) should be declared upon arrival. Failure to do so may result in their confiscation by Eritrean customs officials when you depart.
Dress modestly, especially in lowland and predominantly Muslim areas. Shorts and T-shirts are likely to draw attention.
Homosexual behaviour is illegal, punishable by a prison term. Be discreet. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
