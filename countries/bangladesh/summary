From 14 April until 28 April, all international commercial passenger flights to and from Bangladesh will be suspended.
Passengers are required to complete a 14 day period of quarantine at a government facility, or government approved hotel. You may be tested for COVID-19 during this time. Passengers may be permitted to quarantine at home if they have been vaccinated with two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine and have supporting documents to confirm this.
In all circumstances, people staying in a government approved hotel, government facility or hospital will need to cover the costs of those stays.

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Bangladesh. The threat extends across the country. There have been several IED attacks targeting police and security forces in Dhaka, Khulna, Chittagong and Sylhet. There is a risk that future attacks could target public gatherings, including religious gatherings and political rallies, crowded areas, places with a police or security presence and locations where foreign nationals are known to gather. You should minimise your exposure to these areas, consider your movements carefully and follow any specific advice of the local authorities. See Terrorism
