The authorities in Martinique set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Martinique
All travellers over the age of 11 must undertake a test for COVID-19 within 72 hours before departure for Martinique. The test is obligatory and the traveller must show proof of a negative result before embarking. Travellers may also need to produce a self-certified document affirming that they have no COVID symptoms and that to their knowledge they have not been in contact with any person confirmed positive within the last 14 days. You should check with your travel operator and the local Prefecture’s advice ahead of travel.
Airlines may refuse boarding to anyone who does not produce both proof of a negative result and the self-certified document. Travellers from most destinations will also be required to self-isolate for seven days on arrival in Martinique, before taking another PCR test. See the local Prefecture website for further information.
These entry requirements are subject to change. For further information on the entry restrictions in place for French Overseas Territories, see the French government’s website before travelling.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
Martinique is an Overseas Department of France (département d’outre-mer) and part of the European Union.
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Martinique for stays of up to three months. Other British passport holders, and those who plan to stay longer than three months, should check the current entry requirements on the website of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, if necessary, confirm with the nearest French Diplomatic mission.
Passport validity
You must have at least six months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
