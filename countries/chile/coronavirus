See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Entry prohibited to all non-resident foreign nationals - who in the last 14 days have been in the United Kingdom or any other country with community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or cases caused by variants of concern, as determined by the World Health Organisation. Direct UK-Chile flights have been suspended until further notice.
Upon arrival in Chile, all travellers will have to undergo a PCR or antigen test, even when passengers can present a negative PCR test result.
Any person who tests positive will be transferred to a Residencia Sanitaria (quarantine hotel) together with their close contacts.
Chilean authorities prohibit all non-essential overseas travel to Chileans and resident foreign nationals. There will be some exceptions that can be requested via the Comisaria Virtual website.
From 31 March, all travellers (including Chileans, resident and non-resident foreign nationals) must complete a mandatory 10-day quarantine on arrival in Chile. This can be shortened to 5 days once the passenger has undergone a PCR test with a negative result. See Entry requirements
Non-resident foreign nationals must spend the first 5 days of quarantine in a transitory hotel provided by SEREMI (Chilean health authority). This must be reserved prior to the trip.
Transitory hotels are registered with SERNATUR (national Chilean tourism service) and comply with COVID protocols. These hotels have a “certificate of commitment” to offer a preferential and ethical rate, and not increase their prices. Transitory hotels also have a record of travellers, which they send to SEREMI, to register the entry and exit of travellers, in order to assure compliance with the quarantine.
Chileans or resident foreign nationals can choose a transitory hotel or a hotel authorised by SEREMI for their first 5 days of quarantine.
The cost of the stay in the transitory hotel or the hotel authorised by SEREMI, must be paid by each traveller.
Travellers will be transferred to a ‘transitory’ hotel or hotel authorised by SEREMI, and will need to take a PCR test. They must remain there for five days. After staying at the hotel for five days and having obtained a negative PCR test result, passengers are allowed to leave the hotel to continue to their final destination. If the PCR test result is positive, the passenger will have to remain in a ‘Residencia Sanitaria’ (quarantine hotel). All costs related to transfer, ‘transitory’ hotel, quarantine hotel and PCR test may be charged to the passenger prior to boarding the flight to Chile when filling in the ‘Pasaporte Sanitario’ or on arrival in Chile. Check the Santiago Airport official website (in English) for further information.
From 7 January 2021, all travellers (including Chileans, resident and non-resident foreign nationals) require a negative PCR test (rapid PCR tests will not be accepted) taken within 72-hours of boarding the flight to enter Chile. The mandatory 10-day quarantine will remain in place.
Airlines may require all passengers to have filled-in a “Pasaporte Sanitario” to be allowed to board their flights. This government form requests information on recent countries visited and coronavirus-related health. Once submitted, you will receive a PDF of the completed form that you can store on your phone or print.
If you plan to return to the UK, make sure you have not overstayed on your Chilean visa – this could affect your departure. If you have any concerns about visa renewal, visit the Chilean Immigration Office website for further information.

Travel in Chile
Travellers arriving in Santiago should be aware that local authorities frequently move municipalities (comunas) back and forth through the quarantine Stages Plan (Paso a Paso). You should review the Chilean Government Paso a Paso website.
If you are travelling from or to the airport to catch a flight from or to one of the areas under quarantine or curfew, presenting your passport and boarding pass will permit you to cross any checkpoints. Use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions.
Chilean authorities require the use of face masks in all public spaces / public transport, including the airport. You risk a significant fine for not wearing a mask in public.
From 15 July, there will be two curfew regimes depending on the public health situation and the numbers of vaccinated residents in each region. One curfew is from 10pm to 5am and the other from midnight to 5am (regions with less of 150 active COVID-19 cases and more than 80% vaccinated residents). You should check this information with local health authorities or on the Ministry of Health website, which is updated daily. If you have a medical emergency or funeral during curfew times, you must request a permit (Salvoconducto) online.
Be aware that if you wish to travel to Magallanes Region, you might be required to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel. You should get in contact with your transport operator.
On 28 July 2020, the Chilean government introduced a five stage plan, “Plan Paso A Paso”, for managing and explaining changes in restrictions applied in different regions.
On Wednesday 26 May 2021, the government introduced a special mobility pass (‘Pase de Movilidad’) for vaccinated residents in ‘comunas’ in ‘Cuarentena’ (Stage 1) and ‘Transition’ (Stage 2). You can request the ‘Pase de Movilidad’ on the ‘MeVacuno’ website. This will generate a QR-code after entering your personal information. This permit can only be requested 14-days after completing a full COVID-19 vaccination course in Chile (ie after the second dose for a two-dose course COVID-19 vaccine such as AstraZenica, Pfizer, etc).
The COVID MODE Strategy should be followed in all stages and requires that you respect national/local/regional restrictions at all times: wear face masks on public transport and in: public spaces including shops and supermarkets; keep to social distancing rules; self-isolate immediately if you suspect you have been in contact with a confirmed COVID case.
From 15 July, the mobility rules and permitted numbers for gatherings will vary depending on whether you hold a mobility pass (Pase de Movilidad) and the ‘Paso a Paso’ stage of the ‘comuna’:
Stage 1: Quarantine. Mobility Pass holders: free movement only within the ‘comuna’; restricted gathering capacity on funerals, weddings and religion ceremonies; outdoor exercise activities are allowed at any time. Non-Mobility Pass holders: restricted mobility; permits required for essential activity; a maximum of two a week including one only at weekends; Evening curfew between 10pm to 5am social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75, except on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays between 9am to 11am for 60 minutes or between 4pm to 6pm; prohibition of movement to secondary home. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from Monday to Friday between 5am to 9am and on weekends and bank holidays between 5am to 10am. You should review the Chilean Government Paso a Paso website.
Stage 2: Transition. Quarantine remains in place at weekends and bank holidays. Mobility Pass holders: free mobility at any time; interregional travels are allowed to any other ‘comuna’; social gatherings are allowed with maximum 10 people (all Mobility Pass holders); out/indoor exercise activities are allowed. Non-Mobility Pass holders: social gatherings of no more than five people allowed inside; Evening curfew regime depends on regional health situation , social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place and a prohibition on movement to other regions. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from Monday to Friday at any time (except on curfew). On weekends and bank holidays between 5am to 10am. You should review the Chilean Government Paso a Paso website.
Stage 3: Preparation. Under this stage there are no mobility restrictions within the comuna; Mobility Pass holders: free movement among comunas and interregional travel is allowed; social gathering with maximum 20 people (all Mobility Pass holders); in/outdoor exercise activities are allowed at any time. Non Mobility Pass holders: social gatherings capped at 10 people; Evening curfew regime depends on regional health situation social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; and interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3, 4 and 5. In/Outdoor activities are allowed. You should review the Chilean Government Paso a Paso website.
Stage 4: Initial opening. Significant step that aims to re-open certain low risk activities and to avoid crowds and physical contact. Social gatherings with no more than 40 people permitted if all are Mobility Pass holders; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 25% capacity; restaurants and cafés allowed to open to the public at 25% capacity; Evening curfew regime depends on regional health situation , social distancing still required; pubs and clubs remain closed; Interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3 and 4. You should review the Chilean Government Paso a Paso website for more details.
The Government’s ‘Paso a Paso’ website outlines which phase-out stage each comuna of Chile is under the heading (‘Situación Comunal’).
In those areas under Stage 1 ‘quarantine’ you are only allowed to leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food or medical supplies, you must get a permit from the Comisaria Virtual. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish.
You should be aware that the ‘Pase de Movilidad’ may allow you to move freely among ‘comunas’ in Stage 1 and 2 and interregional travel between ‘comunas’ in Stage 2, 3 and 4. This permit will not allow you to travel abroad.
Individuals that wish to pass the sanitary cordons must obtain a “Salvoconducto” permit and a “Health Passport” (“pasaporte sanitario”) (under “viajeros regionales” for residents or “viajeros regionales” for foreign visitors), at least 24 hours before.
Information on the areas of Chile that have sanitary cordons is available on the Government’s ‘Plan de Acción’.
Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a “Health Passport” prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint.
Public places and services
Chilean authorities require the use of face masks in all public spaces, irrespective of what stage of the quarantine phase-out a comuna is in.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Chile
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Vaccination programme in Chile has already begun. It includes resident foreign nationals but not tourists. Further information is available on the Chilean Government website (in Spanish). Resident Foreign Nationals can apply for their vaccine according to the schedule on the Chilean Government website (key workers, the elderly and those with underlying health conditions have been prioritised). Vaccination in Chile is voluntary and free of charge. Resident foreign nationals must present proof of their resident status.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information.
