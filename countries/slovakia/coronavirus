Public spaces and services
The Slovak government has imposed restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19.
There are nationwide restrictions on movement outside the home. The measures and restrictions in a given district may change according to the local epidemiological situation, as set out in a framework announced by the Slovak government known as the ‘Covid Automat’. Details can be found on the Slovak government website (in Slovak only).
The 20-hour daily curfew is divided into two separate phases lasting from 5am to 8pm and from 8pm to 1am the following day. Between 5am and 8pm you may only leave home for certain permitted reasons. From 8pm until 1am exemptions are reduced further and you may only leave home for certain essential purposes including travel to work, to hospital or a pharmacy, or to walk a pet. For a list of permitted activities and exemptions, some of which may require a recent negative Covid test, see the local English language media The Slovak Spectator. The new measures are also explained in full (in Slovak only) on the Slovak Public Health Authority website.
People who test positive for Covid-19 can no longer go into shops, and may only leave home to visit a doctor or a pharmacy.
Travelling between districts in order to take exercise in the countryside is no longer permitted. However, inhabitants of Bratislava may travel within the Bratislava region, and inhabitants of Kosice may travel within the Kosice “okolie” districts.
The authorities may stop you on main roads, at district borders and in public spaces to check whether your travel is essential.
FFP2 standard facemasks, or higher, are obligatory in all shops, on public transport and in all indoor areas, apart from at home.
From 20 March until at least 28 April, travel abroad for recreational purposes is prohibited, and breaches of the rule could incur a fine of up to 1000 euros. You should expect extra checks and possible delays at borders and airports when leaving Slovakia, and you may be asked to show documentary evidence that your journey is essential.
For more information check the Slovak Public Health Authority (in Slovak only). The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) also has information in English. You should also monitor developments on local English language media such as Radio Slovakia International and The Slovak Spectator.
Healthcare in Slovakia
If you are in Slovakia and you are concerned that you may have the symptoms of coronavirus, you should follow the advice of the Slovak authorities and contact your usual healthcare provider by telephone or email, not in person. If your symptoms are severe, you should call 155 or 112, where some operators may speak English.
The Slovak government website has information in English and advice on how to get tested for Covid-19 (currently in Slovak only). You can also consult your nearest regional office of the Slovak Public Health Authority on their website.
For contact details of local hospitals visit our list of healthcare providers. UK-issued prescriptions are not accepted at Slovak pharmacies, and you should bring sufficient supplies with you to cover your stay. If you need repeat medication you would need to consult a local doctor to get a Slovak prescription issued.
