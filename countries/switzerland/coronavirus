Gatherings of more than 5 people are banned, excluding families and members of the same household.
All contact with other individuals should be kept to a minimum, and a distance of 1 metre should be maintained at all times.
The public are strongly advised to stay at home and employers urged to allow staff to work from home.
All schools, shops, restaurants, bars, leisure and entertainment facilities are closed with exemptions for essential outlets such as grocery stores, pharmacies, health facilities and public transport.
The Government has started a phased relaxing of thesemeasures. Hospitals and medical practitioners (including dentists and physiotherapists) are now able to carry out non-urgent procedures. A range of businesses including DIY stores and hairdressers have reopened. From 11 May, all shops, restaurants, markets, museums and libraries will be allowed to reopen.
