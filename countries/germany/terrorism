Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Germany. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in public places visited by foreigners such as restaurants, places of worship and markets (shopping centres).
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
The German government has announced that increased security has been put in place as a precaution at public buildings, major events, transport hubs and large public gatherings.
Previous attacks in Germany include:
On 19 February a right wing extremist killed two people and injured several others in an attack in the city of Hanau.
On 9 October 2019, a right wing extremist killed two people and injured several others in an attack in the city of Halle
On 19 December 2016, a lorry was driven into a crowd at a Christmas market in central Berlin causing 12 deaths and a number of injuries
On 24 July 2016, a suicide bomb outside a wine bar in Ansbach injured 15 people.
The main threat is from extremists linked to Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) who claimed responsibility for the 2016 attacks in Germany. There is also a threat from individuals with an extreme right wing terrorist ideology. The German authorities have successfully disrupted planned attacks and made a number of arrests.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
