Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Thailand on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Thailand classifies COVID-19 as a communicable disease under surveillance, meaning that COVID-19 is treated similar to a seasonal flu virus.
You do not need to present COVID-19 related documents such as certificate of vaccination and COVID-19 test results upon arrival in Thailand.
Mask wearing is a voluntary practice. However, the Ministry of Public Health continues to recommend that you wear a mask in a crowded or badly ventilated places. You may be required to wear a mask in some public buildings.
More information can be found on the PR Thai Government page.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Health
If you suspect that you have COVID-19 whilst in Thailand, it is recommended that you self-screen using a rapid antigen testing kit (ATK) .
If you test positive for COVID-19 and present with no or mild symptoms, you are not required to be isolated. Take sensible precautionary measures and avoid situations that would transmit COVID-19 to others.
If you have severe symptoms, or any questions related to COVID-19 whilst youâ€™re in Thailand, you should call the Thai COVID-19 Hotline on 1422.
