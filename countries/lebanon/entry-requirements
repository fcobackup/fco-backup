The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in Lebanon are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the Lebanese embassy in the UK.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lebanon
Beirut’s Rafik Hariri international airport re-opened on 1 July and there are direct and indirect commercial flights operating daily.
All passengers travelling to Lebanon must fill this health declaration form online before departure, as required by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health (MoPH).
Passengers travelling to Lebanon, except military personnel, diplomats, members of international organizations, UNIFIL and members of the Lebanese National Social Security Fund or staff cooperative, need to possess an insurance policy that is valid for the duration of their stay in Lebanon, covering all costs of treatment for Coronavirus on Lebanese territory. Alternatively, the policy can be obtained at the insurance counters upon arrival at Rafik Hariri International Airport-Beirut
Certificate requirements and measures within Lebanon
If you’re travelling to Lebanon, you are required to take a PCR test at a laboratory certified by local authorities 96 hours before you travel, and to show the result at check-in at your departure airport. If you do not have a negative PCR test result within this time frame and in an approved form (paper or email, not SMS), you will not be allowed to board your flight to Lebanon. Children under 12 are exempt from this requirement. You must also fill in an electronic form issued by the Government of Lebanon before departure.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Any passenger who shows symptoms of illness including COVID-19 will not be allowed to board the aircraft.
Passengers who left Lebanon for a period not exceeding one week are not required to do a PCR test before departure, but will be subject to a PCR test in Lebanon.
Self-isolation requirements and tests after arrival
From 22 December, travellers from the UK to Lebanon will be subject to supplementary COVID-19 measures in addition to the ones already in place. You will be required to take a PCR test at Beirut International Airport upon arrival (which is provided at the airline’s expense), and then self-isolate at your accommodation for 72 hours before taking another PCR test (that you must arrange yourself) and waiting in self-isolation for the results. If both tests are negative, you may leave self-isolation.
The same measures apply to Lebanese and resident foreign nationals arriving from Iraq.
All other arrivals from Iraq (except Lebanese and resident foreigners) must have a pre-paid hotel booking for 72 hours in a Government of Lebanon-approved hotel, before you travel. On arrival, you must quarantine in one of these hotels for 72 hours during which time a PCR test will be conducted. You will not be allowed to leave the hotel until you receive the second test result.
If you have travelled from Syria, Turkey and all African countries, you must proceed to your accommodation and quarantine for 48 hours, until you receive the results of a PCR test conducted at the airport.
The Lebanese government is keeping these measures under review and they may change at short notice. You must comply with any amended regulations for testing and self-isolation. You should check with your airline and the Embassy of Lebanon in the country you are travelling from before travel.
Transit passengers
There are no testing or additional COVID-19 related procedures required for transiting travelers. Passengers with a short transit time will be allowed to proceed directly to their gate, those with a longer transit time will have to wait at a designated gate where a cafeteria is available.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British citizens can normally apply for a free single entry tourist or family visit visa on arrival. British Overseas Citizens and British Protected Persons will need to get a visa before travelling to Lebanon. Persons of Palestinian origin may also require a visa before travelling, or may be required to carry additional documentation with them when travelling. Entry requirements are subject to change, so you should check with the Lebanese Embassy before you travel.
Overstaying without the proper authority is a serious matter. You may be refused permission to leave until a fine has been paid.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of entry into Lebanon.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Lebanon.
If your passport is stolen, you’ll need to report the theft to the police in the area where it took place and obtain a police report before an ETD can be issued. If your passport has been lost, you’ll need to go to the nearest General Security office and get a certificate of loss before an ETD can be issued. These are mandatory steps in all cases where the original passport showing the entry stamp into Lebanon isn’t available.
Once an ETD has been issued to you, you’ll need to visit the General Security office in central Beirut to obtain an exit visa before you can depart. You should factor the time this will take into any new travel plans.
Previous travel to Israel
If your passport contains an Israeli stamp you may be refused entry to Lebanon even if you hold a valid Lebanese visa.
Stop matches
Lebanese Immigration Authorities check all visitors’ names on arrival against a database of those wanted for, or convicted of, offences in Lebanon. If a name matches against an entry on the database the individual may be detained (or on occasion allowed entry upon surrender of their passport) until they can prove that the record does not relate to them. It’s often possible to do so by producing a copy of a birth certificate or other official documentation that allows parents’ names to be checked against the database. You should consider carrying this kind of supporting documentation.
