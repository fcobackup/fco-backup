All scheduled commercial flights have been cancelled but there are occasional charter flights leaving Mongolia. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Mongolian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK.
Flights
The Government of Mongolia has announced the following charter flights:
26 July: Frankfurt
28 July: Seoul
29 July: Seoul
30 July: Sydney
We understand that British nationals will be able to purchase tickets for the outward legs from Ulaanbaatar. Any British nationals who wish to leave on any of these flights should send their name, contact details and a photo of their passport ID page to consular.mongolia@fco.gov.uk.
The British Embassy cannot guarantee seats on any of these flights. You will be responsible for payment of the ticket. Individuals who book on any of these flights are responsible for making their own onward travel arrangements. You should also check FCO Travel Advice regarding onward flights to the UK from the destinations listed above.
As further information becomes available it will be shared on these pages and on the British Embassy Ulaanbaatar Twitter and Facebook sites. If you wish to leave Mongolia, please send contact details and a photo of the ID page of your passport to consular.mongolia@fco.gov.uk. We will add you to our list and keep you updated.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Future travel options
