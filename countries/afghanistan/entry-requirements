The guidance on this page covers arrival by air to Kabul and reflects the FCDO’s current understanding of requirements. Although COVID-19 related restrictions on travel to Afghanistan are relatively low the FCDO maintains its advice against all travel to most of Afghanistan.
The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Afghanistan
There are no specific restrictions on entry to Afghanistan. However, due to the security situation the FCDO advise against all travel to most of the country and against all but essential travel to the Enhanced Security Area in Kabul, Hamid Karzai International Airport, Panjshir province and Bamian City in Bamian province.
Testing on arrival
Everyone arriving in Afghanistan needs to have their temperature checked at the airport. If your temperature is high, the government will advise you to quarantine and will offer you medical attention at two hospitals in Kabul.
Quarantine requirements
There are currently no compulsory quarantine requirements. However, if you have a high temperature the government will advise you to quarantine.
Data collection
There are no requirements to provide details beyond those in your passport and visa.
Testing on departure
On leaving Afghanistan, passengers need to have their temperature checked. If a passenger has a high temperature the government will advise the airline to consider applying specific safety measures for that individual. Additionally, Emirates and Fly Dubai need passengers to present a COVID-19 negative certificate in order to travel.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You must get a visa before travelling to Afghanistan. You cannot get a visa on arrival. If you’re intending to work in Afghanistan and do not hold a Diplomatic or Official passport you will need a work permit which in turn needs a medical certificate. For further information contact the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in London, including information on any changes in visa process during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Afghanistan.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Afghanistan. However, ETDs are accepted for exit from Afghanistan.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Travelling with children
If you’re travelling alone with a child you may need to produce documentary evidence of parental responsibility. The FCDO does not allow staff based in Afghanistan to travel with their partners or children. For further information on exactly what is needed at immigration, contact the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in London.
