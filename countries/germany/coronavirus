Public spaces and services
Until at least 31 January there will be a range of restrictions on social contact in Germany, aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19:
from 11 January, private gatherings are restricted to one household plus one individual from another household.
non-essential shops are closed. Shops selling food and healthcare products will remain open
personal care service providers such as barbers, hairdressers, tattoo and massage parlours etc. will be closed. Physiotherapy and similar services are allowed
schools and nurseries will largely be closed until at least 31 January
employers are urged to allow employees to work from home
restaurants will be able to provide a takeaway service, but the consumption of alcohol in public is banned
services at churches, mosques and synagogues continue to be allowed as long as 1.5m distancing is maintained, mouth-nose coverings are worn and singing is banned
in some parts of Germany, local travel restrictions are in place and individuals cannot leave a 15km radius of their place of residence (meaning a village, town or city rather than a home)
Mouth-nose coverings are compulsory in many public spaces in Germany.
These restrictions are the minimum and are implemented by Germanyâ€™s 16 states. The rules may vary so check the latest local guidance (in German). There are a variety of sources in English.
These measures will be reviewed in January and may be extended beyond 31 January.
