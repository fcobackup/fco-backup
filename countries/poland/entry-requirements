The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and is the UK government’s understanding of the current rules. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the entry rules. If you’re unclear about any of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
The Polish authorities have introduced new measures in relation to coronavirus. See Staying during coronavirus
Self-isolation rules
You will be required to self-isolate on arrival in Poland for 14 days unless you can show documents to confirm you are:
a commercial driver entering Poland for a limited time for the sole purpose of transporting goods; or
someone who regularly crosses the border into a neighbouring country for work; or
someone who regularly travels from a neighbouring country to study in Poland or who regularly travels from Poland to study in a neighbouring country; or
you are crossing an internal EU border to perform professional, business or paid activities in Poland or countries of the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the United Kingdom.
You will be required to download a special “Home Quarantine” app on a smartphone that allows the local authorities to provide information and stay in regular touch during your self-isolation and check you are abiding by the strict quarantine rules. You will also be required to provide information on arrival about your place of stay or address and a telephone number with which you can be contacted regularly during your self-isolation.
Travelling via Germany
If you plan to travel to the UK via Germany you should plan in advance. You will need to show German officials proof of onward travel (for example an onward flight, ferry or train ticket). Entry is ultimately a decision for Border Guards.
You cannot enter, and therefore transit, Poland by road from neighbouring countries unless you meet very limited criteria and quarantine rules. You can enter if you are a:
spouse, child or individual under the permanent care of a Polish national
holder of a Pole’s Card
holder of the right to permanent or temporary stay in Poland or a work permit holder
foreign national driving a means of transport used for transporting goods
diplomat, consular staff member, representative of an international organisation or a member of their family transiting Poland, leaving a maximum of 24 hours after entry
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the length of time you plan to stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The travel rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas 
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Poland. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Poland guide and contact the Polish Embassy if you have further questions.
The travel rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
You can use a UK Emergency Travel Document to enter, airside transit and exit from Poland.
Dual nationals 
If you are a Polish passport holder you will be treated as a Polish national while in Poland, even if you hold a passport from another country. If you are a dual Polish-British national you must enter and exit Poland with a Polish passport or Polish national identity card. Check with the Polish Embassy in London if in doubt.
