Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Addis Ababa Bole International Airport (and other international ports of arrival) have put in place additional measures to screen passengers arriving, departing or transiting through Ethiopia. Screening may include temperature measurements and checks on recent travel to affected areas.
Those people displaying symptoms linked to coronavirus may be transferred to a nearby isolation facility for up to 24 hours while further tests are carried out. The Ethiopian Public Health Institute advises that anyone who tests positive for the virus but displays only mild symptoms will be required to remain at the isolation facility for a further 14 days, in line with WHO guidance.
Anyone with a pre-existing condition that requires regular medicines should bring sufficient amounts to cover a potential unplanned additional 2 week stay. More serious cases will be transferred to hospital.
Quarantine
All passengers arriving into the country are subject to mandatory self-isolation or quarantine.
Passengers carrying a negative PCR Covid-19 test certificate dated within the previous 72 hours are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days. Only PCR tests will be accepted. You will be tested again upon arrival.
All other passengers will be subject to 7 days mandatory quarantine, at government designated hotels. You may choose from a range of hotels at different prices, but cannot change hotel once your quarantine has started. Passengers are responsible for the full cost of their stay in quarantine. You may need to demonstrate that you have made a hotel booking for your quarantine before boarding your flight.
During quarantine you will be tested for coronavirus. If you test negative you will be required to self-isolate at home for a further 7 days. If you test positive you may need to stay in quarantine or an isolation centre until you have recovered and tested negative.
Contact your airline for more details. If you cannot self-isolate at home, you will be subject to mandatory quarantine instead. You will be monitored by the Ethiopian health authorities throughout your quarantine and self-isolation. You may be moved to an isolation facility if you develop symptoms.
Land border quarantine
On 23 March the Government of Ethiopia announced the closure of the country’s land borders. Some border checkpoints are reopening with screening measures in place, including mandatory quarantine at a government isolation centre for 7 days. The standard of isolation centres varies significantly around the country.
You will be tested for coronavirus at the isolation centre. Those who receive conclusive negative tests will be required to self-isolate at home for a further 7 days. Those testing positive will be treated in line with national coronavirus procedures. See what to do if I have symptoms
