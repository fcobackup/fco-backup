This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Kazakhstan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Kazakhstan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Kazakh Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Kazakhstan, your passport must be valid for at least 30 days from the date you arrive and have at least one blank page. 
If you have a visa for Kazakhstan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after your visa’s expiry date.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to. 
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Dual nationality
Kazakhstan does not recognise dual nationality. If you are found to have a Kazakh passport and another passport, you will be fined and your Kazakh citizenship will be withdrawn.
Visa requirements
You can visit Kazakhstan without a visa for up to 30 days for business or tourism. You can make as many visa-free visits as you like, but you must not stay more than 90 days without a visa in any 180-day period.
To stay longer, to work or study or for other reasons, you must meet the Kazakh government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Kazakh Embassy in the UK. Also see visa information from Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
You can apply for a visa from the Kazakhstan government’s visa website. Check the validity dates of your visa and any restrictions before you travel.
British nationals aged 17 or over who apply for a visa or residency must submit biometrics (fingerprints) as part of the application process.
Registering with the authorities
Your hotel or the person hosting you must register your arrival with the Kazakh authorities. They must do this within 3 working days of your arrival in Kazakhstan. 
Travelling overland between Kazakhstan, Russia and Belarus
Kazakhstan, Russia and Belarus are in a single customs union. If you want to travel overland in your own vehicle between these countries, make sure your customs declaration and temporary import licence are valid for your whole stay in all 3 countries. You can extend the import licence for up to one year by contacting the customs authorities in any of the countries.
See Russia travel advice and Belarus travel advice.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Kazakhstan, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Kazakhstan guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Kazakhstan. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking money into Kazakhstan
There are limits on how much foreign currency you can bring to Kazakhstan or take with you when you leave. Contact the State Revenue Department if you have specific questions.
