There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Indonesia.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Indonesia, you’re strongly advised to return to the UK by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating.
Flights
A limited number of commercial flights are continuing to operate from Jakarta and Bali to the United Kingdom. Flights currently available include:
Qatar Airways has one flight daily from Jakarta via Doha. This service will be suspended from 26-28 and 30 April. From 1 May, this service will operate on Monday, Wednesday and Friday only. There is one remaining flight from Bali via Doha on 25 April. Flights from Bali will then be suspended.
Garuda Indonesia has flights from Jakarta to Amsterdam on 23 and 30 April. This service will then be suspended. If you are in Bali, you can get a domestic flight transfer to Jakarta. Onward transfers are available from Amsterdam to the UK.
Garuda Indonesia/JAL are operating flights from Jakarta via Tokyo Haneda airport on 24, 26 and 28 April. This service will then be suspended.
Before booking seats on any flights, check the entry and transit restrictions in place for countries on your proposed flight route. You should also check with your airline regularly ahead of your scheduled flight. The number of flights operating is reducing and continuing to change at short notice.
Travelling to the airport
you can travel from your accommodation to the airport if you have a valid plane ticket and are not showing any symptoms of coronavirus.
public transport is available, including taxis. If you are being driven, make sure that your driver has the relevant permit allowing them to make the journey. You can also hire a car.
if you are outside Jakarta or Bali, domestic flights in Indonesia, as well as long distance trains and buses, continue to operate with some reduced services.
if you are able to travel overland to Jakarta, authorities may restrict your movement at short notice if you cannot show a valid ticket for an onward international flight. If there is a delay between your arrival in Jakarta and the departure of your international flight, you will need to find accommodation to meet the requirements of locally mandated quarantine rules.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
