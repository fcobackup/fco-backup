This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Taiwan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Taiwan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Taipei Representative Office in London or the Taipei Representative Office in Edinburgh. Entry procedures are being regularly reviewed, so may change at short notice.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Taiwan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You visit Taiwan without a visa for up to 90 days. You can extend this by a further 90 days once you have arrived in Taiwan. You can get more information on entering Taiwan without a visa (‘visa-exempt entry’) from the Taiwan Bureau of Consular Affairs. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
If you plan to stay in Taiwan for longer than 180 days, you must have a visa before you arrive. If you stay beyond the time given on your visa, you will get a fine and risk being deported from Taiwan.
There are specific rules for naturalised British citizens born in the People’s Republic of China and holders of British National (Overseas) passports wishing to enter under the visa waiver scheme.
Contact the Taiwan Bureau of Consular Affairs or Taiwan National Immigration Agency for further information.
Applying for a visa
If you are in the UK and need a visa, apply at your nearest Taipei Representative Office. If you are in Taiwan, apply through the Taiwan National Immigration Agency.
Alien Resident Certificate and Alien Permanent Resident Certificate holders
If you already hold a resident certificate, you do not need a visa to enter Taiwan.
If you hold a Youth Mobility Scheme visa for Taiwan, you can apply to switch to a working visa or a visa to study a degree course at undergraduate level or higher.
Submit your application to the Bureau of Consular Affairs for consideration. If it is approved, you can then apply for an Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) at your local National Immigration Agency (NIA) Service Center. Contact the Bureau of Consular Affairs or National Immigration Agency for further information.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Taiwan guide.   
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Taiwan. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Animal products
Do not bring animal products into Taiwan without authorisation. If you are caught with any animal products, you may face a heavy fine. Customs officials have increased inspections due to concerns about African Swine Fever Virus in pork products, particularly from the People’s Republic of China.
Bringing money into Taiwan
Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is higher than 100,000 New Taiwan dollars (NTD) or 10,000 US dollars. You will get a certified declaration to show you brought it in with you. If you do not, your money could be seized when you leave. Contact the Customs Administration for further information.
International bank transfers can be slow. Most of the ATMs in 7-11 stores accept international cards. Other ATMs may accept them, but not all do.
American Express, Citibank and Thomas Cook branches accept their own-brand travellers cheques. You may need your receipt as well as your passport when you cash them.
