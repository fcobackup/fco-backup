The Solomon Islands general election took place on 3 April 2019 and a new Prime Minister was elected on 24 April 2019. This led to some violent protests and looting in central and eastern Honiara. Local police have responded to restore security, but visitors should be alert to the risk of further protest, and move away from any large gathering. You should monitor local media and be vigilant.
