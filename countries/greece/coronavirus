Entry and borders
Everyone arriving in Greece from abroad must go into 14 days’ self-isolation. This is mandatory, and the authorities will enforce it by prosecution and fines. UK nationals are not affected by the European Union’s measures to close EU borders to non-EU country nationals. If you’re a UK national, you can still enter Greece, but you must comply with the Greek authorities’ advice.
Local measures
The Greek authorities have implemented a number of measures to fight the spread of coronavirus. Some of these measures have recently been revised and further changes are likely. You can read the Greek authorities’ plans for future changes here. These plans remain subject to change, and you should monitor regularly for updates.
Travel outside your Prefecture of stay or residence (e.g. Attica) is forbidden.
Use of shared swimming pools, including within apartment complexes, is forbidden.
Public gatherings of more than 10 people are forbidden.
Some shops and public services are closed. As of 11 May, driving schools and most shops (except for those within shopping centres) are permitted to open, subject to limits on the number of customers per square metre. You should conform with these requirements, and all other advice of the Greek authorities.
For the public it is mandatory to wear facemasks on public transport, in taxis, in all medical facilities and in lifts. Use of facemasks is strongly recommended in other closed spaces.
All schools, nurseries and universities are closed, except from 11 May for final-year high school (‘Likeio Gamma’) students.
All hotels are closed, though AirBnB accommodation remains available. Most campsites in Greece are closed, but the campsite in Igoumenitsa, at Drepano Beach, is currently open. Here, local authorities have undertaken to supply facilities to those in Campervans who have nowhere else to stay. You should confirm this with the campsite before travelling.
Travel to the Greek islands is restricted. To purchase a ticket to travel to an island, you will need to provide proof of permanent residence (via a tax certificate) on the island to which you wish to travel. One-way travel from islands to the mainland is not restricted.
Cruise ships are banned from landing in Greek ports. Private sailboat (and yacht) travel between 2 points within Greece is forbidden, except for private sailboats of less than 7 metres’ size. Sailboats of 7 metres or less may be used (including for open sea swimming), but should not approach islands; nor should you stay overnight on any sailboat.
Changes to what is open or permitted, including international travel options, are subject to change and may occur at short notice. Keep up to date with the latest information and advice from your travel contact or business partners, as well as the sources in this travel advice.
Healthcare
If you think you have symptoms, including a fever or respiratory difficulties such as shortness of breath or a cough, you should avoid visiting local health facilities, but contact a doctor remotely to see whether a test is recommended.
For more information, consult the Greek National Public Health Organisation (NPHO) online or via telephone (dial 1135, or 210 521 2054, from within Greece). The NPHO can provide contact details of a doctor; their telephone line operates 24 hours a day. You should continue to follow this advice if symptoms develop after the conclusion of a 14-day period of self-isolation.
