Travel in Zimbabwe
Zimbabwe is currently in indefinite lockdown. During this time, you are required to stay at home except to buy essential food or medicine, or seek essential healthcare. Only certain categories of key workers are exempt. There is a curfew between 10pm to 6am which is being enforced by the security services. You should comply with these requirements, wherever you are staying in Zimbabwe.
You should avoid any political gatherings or demonstrations. These can be unpredictable, can turn violent without notice and the response from the security forces may be disproportionate. You should exercise a high degree of caution and monitor local media and this travel advice for updates. It is compulsory to wear a face mask covering the nose and mouth whenever you are outside of your home.
Public transport is limited. Intercity travel remains restricted. Tourists are authorised to travel between airports and designated tourist facilities. Be sure to take confirmation of your bookings with you when travelling.

Healthcare in Zimbabwe
If you take regular medication, you should ensure you have a sufficient supply and make sure you can access a repeat prescription in the event of travel delays. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe pharmacies do not accept prescriptions issued in the UK. There is no reciprocal healthcare agreement between Zimbabwe and the UK. For contact details of English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your medical practitioner for advice.
The government of Zimbabwe has said that anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be detained at a place of isolation for 14 days.
