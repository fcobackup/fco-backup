There have been political protests in Abidjan and around the country (including in Bangolo, Bonoua, Daoukro, Divo and Dabou) since 8 August. There is a curfew in Bonoua until 27 August from 8pm until 5am daily. Curfews in other towns may be put in place at short notice. Further protests are likely ahead of the October 31 Presidential election. See Safety and security.
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Côte d’Ivoire. There is an increased risk of terrorism and kidnap in northern border areas, due to the porous nature of borders into the Sahel region. However, there remains a risk elsewhere in the country. Attacks on beach resorts, hotels, cafés and restaurants visited by foreigners are possible and could occur without warning. Be especially vigilant in these places. See Terrorism
You will need to get a visa before you travel. See Visas
Violent crime can occur at any time. Be particularly vigilant and take care when travelling by road, especially at night. See Crime
