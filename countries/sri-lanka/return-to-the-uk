There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Sri Lanka.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Sri Lanka, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Do not run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating.

Flights
Qatar Airways are operating flights from Colombo to Doha 3 times a week (Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays), with onward connections to the UK
Sri Lankan Airlines is operating a one-off flight from Male – Colombo – London on 13 May. Their scheduled flights are suspended until at least 15 May
Airlines operating via the United Arab Emirates, including Emirates Airlines and Etihad, have suspended flights out of Colombo.
Some airlines are changing flight schedules with little prior notice. You should keep in close contact with your airline or travel agent.
If your airline has cancelled your flight you may need to buy a new ticket with one of the airlines that continue to operate. Your original airline or your insurance provider will be able to confirm arrangements for refunds.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
Curfew measures remain in place, and are being enforced.
The government has confirmed that airline tickets can be used by passengers as a curfew pass to travel to the airport. Your hotel or travel agency should be able to help book transport to the airport. The government has established a helpline for tourists (1912) who are facing problems booking taxis to the airport for departure.
