International travel
Roberts International Airport (RIA) is open for commercial flights, however flights to and from Liberia remain limited. There are no direct flights between the UK and Liberia.
If you’re travelling to the UK, you should check the availability of onward flights from transit countries on your route. Schedules may be reduced and can change at very short notice. For the latest information on your planned route, you should check with airlines and your travel company.
If you’re transiting another country between Liberia and the UK, you should check travel advice of the countries on your route for the latest entry requirements. Your airline may refuse to allow you to board in Liberia if you do not meet all requirements. The Belgian Government currently lists Liberia as a “red” country for coronavirus risk. There may be additional requirements for transiting through Brussels to return to the UK. You should check travel advice before travelling. From 11:59 pm on 21 June, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will not permit entry to travellers from Liberia. This includes transit passengers (except for upcoming transit flights to Liberia). You should check travel advice before travelling.
Some regional airlines are operating with reduced flight schedules.
Currently all land borders (with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire) are closed to travellers. Ports remain open.
Coronavirus testing for departing travellers
Before departure from Liberia, you will need a negative COVID-19 test result, and a travel certificate issued by Liberia’s National Public Health Reference Laboratory. For exemptions, see Exemptions to PCR testing on departure section below.
You must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result, from a test conducted by Liberia’s National Public Health Reference Laboratory within 72 hours of departure. Some airlines may require a shorter testing period. You should check with your airline before travelling.
COVID-19 testing for travellers is available at the Union Center, located in Sophia, Congo Town, Monrovia from 9am to 4pm 7 days per week. Individuals have reported wait-times of up to 5 hours during busy periods. An appointment system is not available.
There are two testing options. Regular tests are US$50 for travel within the ECOWAS region or US$75 for travel outside the ECOWAS region. Expedited tests, with results certificates within 24 hours are available for an additional charge of US$100 (total charge $150 for travel in the ECOWAS region, or $175 for travel elsewhere). Individuals have reported significant delays to receiving results due to laboratory backlogs. You may wish to consider expedited tests and should ensure your flight ticket is flexible.
Regular sample processing could take several days. If you are not paying for an expedited test, it is recommended you submit your sample as soon as possible within 72 hours of your departure to allow the greatest time for processing as results can take over 48 hours.
NPHIL encourages all travellers to register at http://liberiacovidtravel.org before arrival at the Union Center. This website does not employ SSL technology and is not a secure website. To register, select “Request a Travel Certificate” and submit the required information. You will be asked to provide personal information (name, gender, date of birth, nationality, address in Liberia, county of residence (in Liberia), passport details, phone number(s) and email address) and travel details (destination, departure date, flight number). When you complete your registration you will receive a unique identification number to retrieve your test results.
You must pay the test fee before submitting your sample. There are two payment options available. If you have completed registration on the website, you can click “Proceed to Payment” to be redirected to a secure payment site which employs SSL technology. Alternatively, you can pay at the United Bank for Africa (UBA) window at the Union Center (in US dollars cash or by card).
To check your PCR test results online, visit www.liberiacovidresult.org 2 to 3 days after sample collected you must enter your unique identification number (provided when your sample was collected), and your year of birth. The National Reference Lab is experiencing capacity constraints and your result may be delayed beyond the 72 hours target.
If your test result is negative, you can apply for a travel certificate online by visiting http://liberiacovidtravel.org and clicking on “Print Travel Certificate”. You should print your certificate.
If your test result is positive, the Ministry of Health or the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) will contact you and you will not be permitted to travel. You will be subject to Liberia’s case management guidelines. This means NPHIL will consider your care on a case-by-case basis and you may be taken to a government COVID-19 Treatment Unit. Private health care facilities are not currently permitted to treat COVID-19 patients. Authorities usually aim to keep families with minors together. If you are travelling with minors, this could mean all family members being transferred to a government COVID-19 Treatment Unit or Precautionary Observation Center (POC), i.e. quarantine, even if only one person has tested positive. Home-based care is considered on a case-by-case basis. If you test positive, your hotel may ask you to leave your accommodation. The Liberian authorities will not provide financial assistance or support with alternative accommodation for any travellers required to leave their hotel as a result of a positive COVID-19 test result.
Exemptions to PCR testing on departure:
Children under the age of 5 years old are exempt from COVID-19 testing and do not require a test result certificate. However, if your airline or the country you are travelling to requires testing of children under 5 years, the testing fees will apply as above.
Diplomats and their families, honorary consuls, duly accredited international organisations’ staff and Liberian diplomats are exempt from testing on departure. However, voluntary testing at the Union Center is available free of charge. If requesting expedited results within 24 hours, the $100 additional fee applies.
Cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers with layovers less than 48 hours (subject to airline policy).
Although Government of Liberia does not require exempt travellers to do testing on departure, airlines may require proof of negative test result to allow boarding, regardless of exemption status.
Testing protocols could change at short notice. You should monitor this travel advice for updates, contact your airline before travel, and consult government sources for announcements (see Further information).

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
