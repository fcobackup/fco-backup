Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Indonesia.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Indonesia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Indonesian Embassy in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Indonesia, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and have at least 2 blank pages.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Indonesia.
You can get a 30-day visa on arrival (VOA) for:
tourism or visiting
business or an official meeting
procurement of goods
official visits or government duties
The VOA costs 500,000 Indonesian rupiah, payable in cash or by card. It is valid for single entry only. You must meet passport validity requirements and have a return or onward ticket. Most of the main airports and ports issue VOAs.
You can also apply for a visa at least a week before you leave on the Indonesian immigration website. You will find options to apply for a multiple-entry visa or a 60-day visa.
Extending your visa or residence permit
The 30-day visa can be extended once, for another 30 days, at any immigration office within Indonesia. If you applied online, you can get the extension on the Indonesian immigration website.
Make sure you extend your visa within the initial 30 days to avoid an overstay fine of 1 million rupiah a day.
KITAS extension (stay or work permit)
If you’re a KITAS holder with an expired stay permit, you can apply for an extension from outside Indonesia through a sponsor. The sponsor must submit the application to the immigration office attaching a copy of your passport and proof of your departure from Indonesia. The application is submitted without biometric sampling. The sponsor must report your arrival within 30 days.  
Visa scams
Beware of visa scams by fake visa agents who, having taken your money, may fail to provide a visa or supply the wrong visa. This could result in you overstaying and getting a fine of 1 million rupiah a day, plus possible deportation and a re-entry ban. Use the Indonesian immigration website to get or extend your visa.
Visa scams are increasing in Indonesia. Some travellers have lost significant amounts of money. Others have been deported despite paying a large fee to an agent to get the correct visa or extension.
Overstaying your visa
If you overstay your visa, officials will stop you at the airport and issue a fine of 1 million rupiah for each day you overstayed.   
If you do not pay, the authorities can detain you until the fine is paid.
If your visa will expire during a period of hospitalisation or detention, contact Indonesian immigration before your visa expires to avoid any overstay fines. The British Embassy in Jakarta can help with this.
Health Pass requirements
To enter Indonesia, all international travellers must fill out an electronic self-declaration form called SATUSEHAT Health Pass. It is recommended that you complete this form prior to departure to avoid delays when arriving in Indonesia.
Registering with the police 
If you stay in private accommodation in Indonesia, you must register your presence with the local police at the nearest police station. You could be fined 5 million Indonesian rupiah if you do not register. If you’re staying in a hotel, you will be registered automatically.
Bali tourist levy
The Bali provincial government has introduced a tourist levy of 150,000 Indonesian rupiah (approximately £8) for all foreign tourists arriving in Bali. You can pay online or on arrival. See the Bali provincial government website for more details.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Indonesia, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Indonesia guide.
Departure tax
Airport tax is included in the cost of all domestic flights within Indonesia. For some international flights departing Indonesia, airport departure tax might not be included in the price of the ticket. Check with your airline or travel agent before you travel.
