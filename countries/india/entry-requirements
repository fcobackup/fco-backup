Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of India.

This advice reflects the UK Government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in India set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the High Commission of India in London or another Indian consulate in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering India.
Passport validity requirements
Make sure your passport is valid for at least 6 months from your date of entry into India.
Your passport must also: - have 2 blank pages for your visa
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
Apply for the right type of visa for the purpose of your travel.
You need a visa to travel to India unless you are an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholder.
India has a number of visa categories. Make sure you get the right visa for the purpose and duration of your travel.
Penalties for having the wrong visa can include refusal of entry or deportation. This may also include not being allowed to enter India in the future.
For latest information on Indian visas and immigration requirements, see the e-FRRO online portal (part of the Indian Foreigners Registration Office), the Bureau of Indian Immigration website and Indian Ministry of External Affairs website.
Applying for a visa or e-visa
Find out how to apply for a visa from the Indian Bureau of Immigration. Depending on your requirements you may be able to apply for:
regular (paper) visa
e-visa (make sure to check the website’s ‘FAQs’ for restrictions on airports and seaports of entry)
Check your eligibility and any restrictions before you apply and allow plenty of time for your application to be processed.
More information is available from the website of High Commission of India in London.
Applicants of Pakistani origin
If you are of Pakistani origin, a British-Pakistan dual national, or holding a National Identity Card for overseas Pakistanis (NICOP), the visa processing time will be substantially longer than other visa applications. More information is available from the High Commission of India in London.
If you are a British-Pakistan dual national, you must apply for an Indian visa on your Pakistani passport. If you have renounced your Pakistani nationality or cancelled your Pakistani passport, you will need to submit documentary proof of this.
Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders
If you hold a valid Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) card, you can use this, along with your valid British passport to visit India. You do not need a visa. If you have a Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) card, you will need to convert it to an OCI card. More information is available from the High Commission of India in London and the Indian Bureau of Immigration.
Arrival, registration, and extensions
If you plan to stay in India for more than 180 days and do not hold an OCI card, register within 14 days of arrival with the Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO). You could be denied permission to leave if you do not do this. Check if you are required to register your arrival.
Overstaying in India on a visa is an offence. Make sure you leave the country before your visa expires or get an official extension if needed. More information is available on the Indian Bureau of Immigration website.
If you’re hospitalised
If you or someone you’re travelling with has a short-term Tourist Visa and is hospitalised, you may be able to extend or ‘convert’ to a Medical Visa.
Exit requirements
You will pass through immigration as you depart India. Officials will check when you entered the country. If you do not have an entry stamp, for example if you have a newly issued passport, you will need to apply for special exit visa before you travel. This must be done online and can take between five and fifteen working days for straightforward applications. Factor this into your timeframe to leave India when you are booking flights. For further information see the e-FRRO online portal (part of the Indian Foreigners Registration Office).
Vaccination requirements (other than COVID-19)
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and vaccination certificates you may need on TravelHealthPro (from the UK’s National Travel Health Network and Centre).
Depending on your circumstances, these may include:
polio
yellow fever
The Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare also provides vaccination guidance and data.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of India. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Satellite phones and listening devices
It is illegal to possess and operate satellite phones in India without a licence. British nationals have been arrested for bringing them into the country without prior permission. You can contact the Indian Department of Telecommunication to request a licence.
You may also need prior permission from the Indian authorities to bring equipment like listening or recording devices, radio transmitters, powerful cameras, or binoculars into India. You can ask the High Commission of India in London for advice.
Taking money into India
There are restrictions on bringing Indian rupees into India.
Visitors, including tourists, must not bring any amount of Indian currency into the country. If you’re resident in India, you can bring up to 25,000 rupees into the country.
If you’re visiting India, you can bring cash, travellers’ cheques (in pounds sterling or another foreign currency) or a bank card with you and exchange or withdraw rupees once in India.
You must declare any amount above 5,000 US dollars in notes, or 10,000 US dollars in notes and travellers’ cheques combined.
