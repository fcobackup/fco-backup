Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Onward or return travel from Portugal
If you need a pre-departure test for the country you are travelling to or transiting through, you can get one in Portugal including in Madeira and the Azores, by scheduling an appointment at an approved facility or at test sites at the airports. You will not need a prescription, but you will have to show your passport and confirmed travel bookings. You will also have to pay in full. It can take up to 24 hours to get the results.
Public spaces and services
Face coverings
Face coverings are still required in certain settings. See sections on Mainland Portugal, Madeira and Porto Santo and The Azores below for details. You should wear your face covering, as required, when you enter buildings and keep it on until you leave.
You can be fined if you breach the regulations.
Exemptions from wearing a face covering differ in Portugal compared to the UK. You may be exempt from wearing a face covering on medical grounds, but you will have to show a declaration from your doctor. For further information (in Portuguese) on exemptions, see decree-law 62-A/2020 (Article 3(2).

Most restrictions have been lifted, but you will still need to wear a face covering on entry to medical facilities, pharmacies and retirement and nursing homes, or if you test positive for COVID-19.
