Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Nigeria.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Nigeria’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Nigeria set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Nigeria High Commission in the UK.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Nigeria, your passport must have an expiry date at least 6 months after the date you arrive. 
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to. 
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to enter Nigeria as a visitor. Get your visa before travelling.
Some business travellers are eligible to apply for a visa on arrival. Check the visa conditions from Nigerian Immigration Services.
If you have a valid Nigerian residence permit (CERPAC or Green Card), you do not need a visa to enter Nigeria.
For further information contact the Nigeria High Commission in the UK.
Applying for a visa
You can apply for a visa from Nigerian Immigration Services.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Nigeria, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Nigeria guide.
Health screening
You must fill in an online Nigeria Health Declaration Form when entering Nigeria. This includes transit passengers. On arrival, a paper version is available.
You may be asked to take part in thermal screening and carry out a travel history check. This is a Nigerian government policy to improve the detection of diseases of public health importance.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Nigeria. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
It is illegal to import beer, mineral water, soft drinks, sparkling wine, fruits, vegetables, cereals, eggs, textile fabrics, jewellery or precious metals.
It is illegal to export African art, particularly antiques, without written authorisation from the Department of Antiquities.
