This page has information on travelling to Chile. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Chile set and enforce entry rules.
Chilean customs authorities in Santiago Airport require all travellers to complete an affidavit (Declaracion Jurada) indicating whether you are carrying products of animal or plant origin when entering Chile. You can complete it prior to travel on the SAG website or on arrival using a hard copy form available in the airport between baggage collection and the final customs check.
From 1 December, entry is prohibited to all non-resident foreign nationals who have been in South Africa, Zimbawe, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini and Mozambique during the last 14 days.
From 1 December, travellers arriving in Chile with further domestic flight connections will no longer be required to quarantine on arrival until they receive a negative PCR test result (carried out by health authorities on arrival). Mobility Pass holders can continue their trip and quarantine in their final destination until they receive a negative PCR test result. If they are required to take an antigen test, they will need to wait for the result before onwards travel.
Please note that you will be required to provide a valid Mobility Pass in order to travel on a domestic connecting flight.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
The Chilean Government has a ‘Fronteras Protegidas’ (Protected Borders) Strategy.
You are allowed to enter Chile if you are:
a Chilean national or a resident foreign national; or
a non-resident foreign national only if you have proof of vaccination validated by the Chilean authorities prior to travel. To do this, you must apply online to have your vaccination validated and receive a Chilean “Pase de Movilidad” (Mobility Pass) by visiting MeVacuno website. You should allow up to 30 days for your application to be processed. (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’). Please note the Embassy is unable to assist in obtaining this pass.
or you fall into one of the ‘exceptions’ listed in Decree 102. You should contact the nearest Chilean Consulate/Embassy prior to travel.
and hold travel insurance covering a minimum of $30,000 USD for COVID-related issues. This also applies for authorised non-resident foreigners listed in Decree 102.
From 1 December, all children under 6 years old (including non-resident foreigners) regardless of their vaccination status are allowed to enter Chile.
From 1 December, entry is prohibited to all non-resident foreign nationals who have been in South Africa, Zimbawe, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini and Mozambique during the last 14 days.
Chilean and resident foreign nationals, who have been in the above countries during the last 14 days, are allowed to enter Chile. However, they have to undergo an antigen or PCR-test on arrival and comply with a 7-day quarantine period.
All travellers (including Chileans, resident and authorised non-resident foreign nationals) must:
have a negative PCR test SARS-COV-2 (rapid and antigen tests are not acceptable), taken not more than 72 hours before boarding the final flight into Santiago. Children under 2 years old are exempt
complete an Affidavit (Declaración Jurada) up to 48 hours before boarding. This will generate a QR-code by separate email, which you must show to the airline and during the health screening process on arrival in Chile. Health authorities at Santiago Airport will request all travellers complete a daily ‘self-report’ – for 10 days – via an online form or ‘C19 AutoReporte’ application. The health authorities will provide the detail of this process by email following the health screening.
follow the instructions of airport authorities to undergo an antigen or PCR test SARS-COV-2 either in the airport or at an external laboratory outside the airport. If the latter, you will need to do this within 24 hours of arrival. If you undergo an antigen test, you will need to wait for the results in the airport. If the result is positive, non-resident foreigners will be denied entry into the country.
Mobility Pass holders will need to remain in quarantine until you receive a negative test result. Resident foreign nationals without a valid Mobility Pass will need to remain in quarantine for 7 days, regardless of a negative antigen or PCR test result.
The air borders entry points currently open for those who meet these entry requirements are:
Arturo Merino Benítez airport
Iquique airport
Antofagasta airport
Punta Arenas airport
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Chile will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. You will need to use this to apply for a Chilean Mobility Pass (‘Pase de Movilidad’) on the Chile Government’s MeVacuno website in order to be able to enter the country. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered within 6 months prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Our latest understanding is that non-resident foreign nationals with two vaccinations will be entitled to a Mobility Pass valid for 30 days, those with a booster shot will be entitled to 90 days validity.
Public health measures on arrival in Chile
Upon arrival, all travellers, will be required to undergo another PCR or antigen test and self-isolate until they receive the negative PCR-test result. This is in addition to the negative test they undertook prior to travel. Resident foreign nationals without a valid Mobility Pass will need to remain in quarantine for 7 days, regardless of a negative antigen or PCR test result.
Health authorities at Santiago Airport will require completion of a follow-up online form for 10 days from the arrival date.
If you arrive in Chile with a domestic connecting flight, you do not need to quarantine on arrival. You can continue your trip and quarantine in your final destination until you receive a negative PCR test result.
Please note that you will be required to provide a valid Mobility Pass in order to travel on a domestic connecting flight.
Quarantine requirements for travellers who must self-isolate:
Strict quarantine in private or declared residence or at a hotel. Transit hotels are no longer an option to quarantine
If you choose to quarantine in a hotel, you cannot leave the hotel room.
All other residents at the registered quarantine address must also quarantine for the same length of time
You must use private transportation to reach the registered address
From 1 December, if travel companions of children under 6 years old have validated their vaccines, regardless of their booster shot status, only the child will have to remain in quarantine. For holders of a valid Mobility Pass, this quarantine period can be lifted if the result of the antigen or PCR test carried out by health authorities on arrival is negative.
From 1 December, all travellers whose PCR-test on arrival is positive and suspected of being the Omicron variant, must comply with a 7 day quarantine period in a government quarantine hotel or residence
You may be required to undergo a PCR or antigen test at any time during the 14 days following arrival.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
