This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Turkmenistan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Turkmenistan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of Turkmenistan in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
While Turkmenistan doesn’t require COVID-19 vaccination, all travellers must undergo a COVID-19 test upon arrival, which costs about 31 US dollars.
Confirm the latest requirements with your Turkmen sponsor, or with the embassy that issued your visa if you have one. Check with your travel company or airline for changes.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Turkmenistan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you plan to leave Turkmenistan.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Turkmenistan.
If you have the wrong visa or if you overstay your visa, you could be prosecuted and possibly imprisoned.
Applying for a visa
Contact the Embassy of Turkmenistan in London at least a month ahead of your intended travel date.
You need a letter of invitation to support your application. For tourist visits, authorised travel agents can provide these letters. If you are travelling on business, you will need letters from the relevant government ministries or companies you want to do business with. If you want to attend an exhibition or event, the organiser normally provides visa support.
You should keep your letter of invitation with you when you are in Turkmenistan.
The Embassy of Turkmenistan will refer your visa application to Ashgabat for a decision, which can take up to a month. There is an accelerated 24-hour service costing about 150 US dollars.
Transit visas and travelling through Turkmenistan by car
You can use a transit visa if you will be in Turkmenistan for less than 5 days. You cannot change your transit visa to a tourist visa, and you must notify the authorities if you intend to change your route.
You cannot buy a transit visa at Baku seaport. If you want to travel to Azerbaijan by sea, you need to have visas for both Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan.
You’ll be charged up to 150 US dollars to bring a car into Turkmenistan by land or sea.
Border officials may close Turkmen border crossings without notice.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Turkmenistan guide.
Registering with the authorities
If you’re staying for more than 3 days, you must register with the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan within 3 days of your arrival. Your hotel will usually register you, but if you are staying in private accommodation you’ll need to go and register in person.
In Ashgabat, register at the office at 57 Azadi Street. If you’re not staying in Ashgabat, you should register at the local department office. You must provide 2 passport-size photos and provide confirmation of your departure date from your employer or sponsor.
Taxes for foreign nationals
On arrival, you must pay a migration fee of 14 US dollars. All foreign visitors must also pay a ‘tourism tax’ of 2 US dollars for each day of their stay in Turkmenistan. Hotels include the tax as a separate item on your bill.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Turkmenistan. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
‘Tobacco products to the amount of 2 packs’ means you can bring one of:
2 packets of cigarettes – a total of 40 cigarettes
2 cigars
2 packs of tobacco each weighing no more than a packet of cigarettes
It is illegal to give tobacco products as a gift. If you are caught, you could get a fine.
Taking money into Turkmenistan
Turkmenistan is largely a cash-based society. Carry cash and pay in the Turkmen currency, manat. Some larger hotels and restaurants accept US dollars - you should check before purchasing. Other outlets are only allowed to accept manat.
You can exchange US dollars and euros at the official manat rate easily at a bank or money exchange. Bring new, clean notes as exchanges will reject damaged or marked notes. Other currencies are difficult to exchange. Manat cannot be re-converted, so exchange only as much as you need.
There are a limited number of international ATMs in Ashgabat, but they can run out of manat notes. There’s a 3% withdrawal charge for each transaction. You are strongly recommended to bring enough dollars for your entire trip.
