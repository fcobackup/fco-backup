Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Argentina. The Argentine authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The FCO strongly advise non-resident British nationals in Argentina to return to the UK as soon as possible. For information on how to return to the UK from Argentina, see Return to the UK
Borders and travel
Argentina’s borders are closed to foreign nationals and non-residents entering the country until midnight on 10 May. The borders remain open for departures. While the Argentine government is permitting a limited number of exceptional international flights, all scheduled international flights have been suspended until 1 September.
There are no longer direct flights from Argentina to the UK. Some airlines continue to fly very limited routes back to the UK via third countries, although these are likely to be affected by the closure of Argentina’s borders. All flights are subject to change and cancellation at short notice. Travellers should regularly check availability with these airlines.

Due to these restrictions, the 90 day permission for tourists to stay in Argentina is being extended each month by 30 days if your original 90 days expired after 17 March, see Entry requirements.
Local measures
Argentina is under a nationwide quarantine until midnight on 10 May. There are a number of exemptions. You are allowed to travel to an airport if you already have a flight booked. You are allowed to make single person journeys to buy necessities, such as medicines or foodstuffs, in your local area.
In some parts of the country (not including Buenos Aires and other larger cities), you are also allowed to go out for up to one hour each day provided that; you remain within 500 meters of your accommodation; you do not use public transport; and you comply with social distancing. This allows people to go for a walk but not to go for a run. The locations where this exemption applies are subject to change so check the advice of local authorities.
Anyone outside their accommodation without justification may be charged with committing a public health crime.
You must cover your nose and mouth on public transport. In some parts of Argentina, further measures have been introduced to prevent the spread of coronavirus. This includes the obligatory covering of your nose and mouth with a facemask or other garment when in public in the cities of Buenos Aires and Cordoba and in the following provinces: Buenos Aires, Mendoza, Catamarca, Salta, Jujuy, La Rioja, Misiones, Santiago del Estero, Santa Fe and Río Negro. The government of the City of Buenos Aires has also urged those over the age of 70 not to leave their homes at all during the quarantine.
Additional restrictions may also be in place where you are, and you could be subject to a financial penalty if you do not abide by local regulations. You should therefore make sure that you follow the advice of local authorities and check what measures have been introduced wherever you are in the country.
