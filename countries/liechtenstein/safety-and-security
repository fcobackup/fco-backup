Illegal drugs

Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
There is a risk of avalanches in mountainous areas all year round. You can check updates from the European Avalanche Warning Service. Follow all warnings and consider carrying search equipment.
Conditions on roads in mountainous areas can quickly become difficult in winter. Carry water, food, warm clothing and medicines in your vehicle.
Hiking and mountaineering
Check weather forecasts and conditions and make sure you’re properly equipped for the worst-case scenario. Do not undertake any activity alone and consider hiring a guide. Always leave a copy of your itinerary with someone.
Alpine hazards throughout the year include:
avalanches and snowdrifts
landslides and flooding
glacial crevasses and hollows
rockfall
thunderstorms
altitude sickness
sun exposure
sudden weather changes
If you are taking part in extreme sports, check the company is well established and make sure the specific activities are covered by your travel insurance.
Skiing
Off-piste skiing is highly dangerous. Your insurance should include mountain rescue services, helicopter costs and repatriation or transfer to neighbouring countries for treatment.

Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Liechtenstein, see information on driving abroad and check the rules of the road in RAC’s Liechtenstein guide. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.
You can drive in Liechtenstein with a UK driving licence. You do not need an international driving permit (IDP).
Check if you need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. Alpine winters make driving more difficult. Equip your car with winter tyres and snow-chains, and check road conditions before departure.
If you are visiting Liechtenstein, you may be able to use your Blue Badge in some circumstances. Check local parking rules.
The police strictly enforce road regulations. If you are stopped by police for a traffic offence you could face a heavy fine and a possible prison sentence.
Tolls
If you plan to travel to Liechtenstein using motorways in Switzerland or Austria, you must buy and display a motorway vignette (sticker) in those countries or risk a large on-the-spot fine.
