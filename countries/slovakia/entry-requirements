The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Slovakia
You may enter Slovakia without restrictions if you have spent all of the previous 14 days in a country listed on the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. As of 20 July, this includes the UK.
If you have spent any of the previous 14 days in a country not on this list, you must self-isolate on arrival and register with your regional Public Health Authority office, who will contact you after at least 5 days to arrange a free RT-PCR test for COVID-19. If you are self-isolating at a private residence, anyone living in the same household must also self-isolate. After you receive a negative test result, you may end your self-isolation. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in a fine of up to 5,000 euros.
This information applies to UK nationals arriving by air or across land borders with Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. Entry to Slovakia from Ukraine is only permitted in certain circumstances, such as in transit and for those with residency in Slovakia. For more information, see the Slovak Government’s Coronavirus website.
Transiting Slovakia
Exemptions on transit for EU nationals continue to apply equally to UK nationals. If you have spent any of the previous 14 days in a country not listed as “low risk” by the Slovak government, you may transit Slovakia in order to return to your country of residence without the need for self-isolation, testing or permission from the Slovak authorities but you must complete your transit within eight hours.
Transport
Slovakia’s international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad have begun to resume flights to certain permitted destinations. Flights to and from the UK resumed on 20 July.
Border crossings
All land border crossings between Slovakia and Austria, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic are open. See the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for more information.
Border checks remain in place with Ukraine, and the following crossing points are operational:
Road: Ubla- Maly Bereznyj and Vysne Nemecke-Uzhorod. Velke Slemence - Mali Selmenci is also operational between 0800 and 2000 for pedestrians and cyclists only.
Rail: Čierna nad Tisou – Čop
See the Slovak Interior Ministry website (in Slovak only) for latest information on border crossings between Slovakia and Ukraine.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity  
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Make sure your passport is in a presentable state before you travel. The Slovak authorities can refuse entry if your passport is worn or damaged, or looks as if it’s been tampered with.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Slovakia. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Slovakia guide and contact the Slovak Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Registering with the Slovak authorities
If you plan to stay in Slovakia for a longer period of time, you should register with the police within 3 days of arrival. You’ll need your passport, 2 photographs and proof of accommodation. You’ll have an option to apply for a Slovak ‘green card’, which can be used as proof of your ID, while your passport is kept in a safe place. Visit the website of Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic for further information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovakia. They are also accepted for a return to Slovakia if you normally live there.
