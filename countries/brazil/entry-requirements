Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Brazil.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Brazil’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Brazil set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Brazilian Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Brazil.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Brazil, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can visit Brazil without a visa for up to 90 days for tourism.
If you want to extend your tourist visa, contact the Federal Police (in Portuguese) before your visa expires.
For more information about visas, contact the Brazilian Consulate in London.
If you overstay your visa, you’ll face a daily fine. You have the option to pay this fine either when you leave Brazil or during your next visit. You will not be allowed to re-enter Brazil if you do not pay the fine. Overstaying your visa will result in a 6-month ban from re-entering the country.
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
Make sure the border control officer puts a stamp in your passport. If it is not stamped, you may be fined when you leave.
Read about passport stamping if you live in Brazil (in Portuguese).  
At Brazil border control, you must be able to show:
information about the purpose of your visit
evidence you have enough money for your whole stay
details of your accommodation
evidence of return or onward travel
British-Brazilian dual nationals
Brazilian immigration authorities often require dual British-Brazilian nationals visiting Brazil to travel on Brazilian (rather than British) passports.
Travelling with children
Children with dual British-Brazilian citizenship
British-Brazilian dual nationals under the age of 18 who are travelling without all parents or legal guardians need authorisation from all parents or legal guardians to travel in Brazil or leave the country.
If they travel with only one parent (or guardian) or without any parent, they must have 2 original written authorisations from all parents or guardians. Read more about the formal travel authorisation process for Brazilian minors and the frequently asked questions.
You must show this permission when the under-18 leaves Brazil. One copy will be kept by the Federal Police inspection agent, together with a copy of the under-18’s identification document, and the other must stay with the under-18 or the adult accompanying them on the trip.
Children who are not dual British-Brazilian nationals
The Federal Police have sometimes delayed the travel of non-Brazilian under-18s who travel without authorisation from both parents. Families of non-Brazilian under-18s travelling through Brazil without one or both parents should follow the instructions for dual British-Brazilian under-18s. Make sure the under-18 or their travelling companion also carries the original or notarised copy of the under-18’s birth certificate. Contact the Brazilian Consulate in London for more information.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Brazil, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Brazil guide.
