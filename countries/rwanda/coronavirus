The Government of Rwanda has published updated guidance for passengers arriving in and departing from Rwanda.
All Rwandan travellers aged 12 years and above must show proof of full vaccination before departing Rwanda by air.
A COVID-19 test is no longer a requirement to depart Rwanda by air. However, COVID-19 testing (at own cost) is available for all travellers whose final destination requires one, at health centres and other designated sites. Travellers are advised to check with airlines about the COVID-19 requirements of the final destination and/or transit countries and plan for their RT-PCR test accordingly.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19 in Rwanda before returning to the UK, the local authorities will expect the vast majority of people to self-isolate at home for 14 days or until you test negative for COVID-19. If you are visiting and staying in a hotel, you may be asked to self-isolate in your room, or to relocate to another hotel or another floor in your current hotel.
If you test positive, the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC) will follow up and offer further tests until you test negative. You will be expected to self-isolate after testing positive and the RBC will conduct checks to ensure self-isolation compliance.
The RBC will monitor your symptoms and if they are serious, you may be moved to a treatment centre.
Further information about what to do if you test positive for COVID-19 in Rwanda and how you can keep in contact with the health system can be found on the RBC website.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
