Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to visit the BVI. It’s normal practice for BVI immigration authorities to issue you with a one-month entry stamp on arrival. You may also be granted an extension for one further month. Extensions for up to 6 months are granted on the discretion of the Chief Immigration Officer provided that the individual can show proof of independent financial means. You may need to provide evidence of accommodation and your plans to leave the BVI at the end of your stay.
For all other immigration and labour matters, including work permits, contact the BVI authorities:

Passport validity
You must hold a valid passport to enter the BVI. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from the BVI.
If you’re travelling via the USA on an ETD, you will need to get a valid US visa.
As the BVI is a British Overseas Territory, there is no formal British diplomatic or consular representation. UK ETDs are processed by the British High Commission in Barbados.
Departure tax
There is a US$50 tax for all passengers, payable on leaving the BVI by air ($15 departure tax, $5 security charge departure tax and a US$30 airport development fee) for all passengers, payable on leaving the BVI by air. This is generally included in the ticket price. If you’re departing the BVI by ferry, a departure tax of US$20 per person or US$15 for residents is payable.
Visitors arriving by air or sea are also charged an Environmental and Tourism levy of US$10 on arrival.
