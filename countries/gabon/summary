Political stability in Gabon remains uncertain ever since the result of the 2016 presidential election, with violent clashes occurring between demonstrators and security forces at that time. Protests are less common now but happen on occasion and may quickly turn violent without warning. You should avoid all demonstrations and rallies and remain vigilant during periods of unrest. See Political situation.
During periods of unrest, police checks may increase. Make sure you have all required documentation with you and avoid large gatherings.
Consular support may be limited in Gabon. However, the British High Commission in Yaoundé, Cameroon or Honorary Consul in Libreville can provide consular support to British nationals. See Consular assistance
