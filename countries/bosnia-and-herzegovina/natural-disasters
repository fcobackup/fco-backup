Earthquakes and small tremors are recorded throughout the year, usually without consequences. The 5.4 magnitude earthquake in November 2019 with an epicentre 75km south of Sarajevo had minimal impact. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see this advice from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Forest fires are common in Herzegovina (the southern part of the country) during summer heat waves, mostly occurring in inaccessible areas. Fires are normally kept under control, but if they get close to populated areas, road closures are possible.
Flash floods and landslides remain a risk in all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina after heavy rain. In such cases, follow the instructions and guidance provided by local officials and traffic police.
