FCDO advises against travel to parts of Indonesia
Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 118 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Air pollution
Air quality in Indonesia’s major cities can reach levels considered ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’ or ‘unhealthy’. Current air quality data for Jakarta can be found on the Air Quality Index website.
Ash plumes from volcanoes can affect air quality and have an impact on health, particularly for anyone with pre-existing respiratory conditions. If you’re in the vicinity of a volcanic eruption and affected by subsequent ash fall, you can find further information in digital pamphlets issued by the International Volcanic Health Hazard Network (IVHHN), which cover the potential health hazards of volcanic ash and offer advice on how to prepare and cope with ash fall.
During the dry season (May to November), widespread forest fires can cause smoke haze resulting in poor air quality across parts of Indonesia, particularly Riau Islands, central Sumatra and Kalimantan. The haze can cause disruption to local and regional air travel, and the air pollution may have an impact on public health. Keep up to date with local information and seek medical advice on appropriate precautions. A regional haze map is available from the Singapore Meteorological Service.
Tap water
Tap water is not safe to drink in Indonesia.
Dengue fever
There’s a risk of dengue fever in Bali, Jakarta and elsewhere in Indonesia. While this is particularly heightened during the rainy season (usually from around October to April), local outbreaks can occur at any time.
Rabies
Rabies exists in domestic and wild animals. There are many street dogs in Bali and elsewhere. Avoid direct contact with all dogs and cats (including pets), monkeys and other animals and seek immediate help if you’re bitten or scratched.
Avian Influenza (bird flu)
Avian flu has led to over 150 confirmed human fatalities in Indonesia since 2003, although the rate appears to be declining. All cases so far have been linked to close contact with poultry.
Although the risk to humans from Avian Influenza is low, avoid visiting live animal markets, poultry farms and other places where you may come into close contact with domestic, caged or wild birds, and make sure poultry and egg dishes are thoroughly cooked.
Polio virus
In 2019, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative reported 2 cases of genetically linked circulating vaccine derived polio virus (cVDPV) type 1 in Papua Province, Indonesia. This factsheet on the TravelHealthPro website contains information about the Polio outbreak and vaccination recommendations.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on health risks and find out what vaccinations you need for Indonesia on TravelHealthPro
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
TravelHealthPro explains best practice when travelling with medicines.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in Indonesia
The standard of local medical care can be poor and some medical tests cannot be done reliably. Psychological and psychiatric services are also limited.
Good medical care can be expensive and in remote areas attention for serious injuries or illness is likely to be unavailable. Medical evacuation can cost tens of thousands of pounds. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.

COVID-19 healthcare in Indonesia
If you test positive for COVID-19 during your stay in Indonesia you will need to take the following action:
without follow-up PCR test: Isolate for 5 days. Isolation can be at your home or hotel. At the end of 5 days you are deemed recovered.
with follow-up PCR test: Isolate at your home or hotel and take a second PCR test 5 days after your positive test. If this is negative, your SATUSEHAT App certification will become green, and you are deemed to be recovered and can leave isolation.
