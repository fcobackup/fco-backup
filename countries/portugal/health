At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19). Cases have been confirmed in many countries, including Portugal. You should comply with the measures put in place by the authorities to limit the spread of the virus. For more information from the Portuguese authorities, see the Portuguese Ministry of Health website (available in English by clicking on the green globe symbol). If you are feeling unwell and need assistance, call the Ministry’s helpline on (+351) 808 24 24 24 and press 9 for English. If you are in the Azores, call (+351) 808 24 60 24.
The Portuguese authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
The Portuguese government has suspended all flights to and from all regions of Italy until 24 March. If you’re due to travel to Italy, contact your airline or travel company for the latest information. Please also check the TAP Air Portugal, EasyJet and Ryanair websites.
The authorities have also put into place extraordinary measures such as the temporary closure of schools and public sports facilities and restrictions on visiting hospitals and retirement homes. On the mainland, cruise ship passengers can only disembark if they are Portuguese nationals or residents.
Cruise ships and yachts are not permitted to dock at any port in the Azores or Madeira. Travellers arriving by air in Madeira will be asked to complete a questionnaire during their flight and their temperature will be taken on arrival. Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website
You can find more information about the situation in Portugal from the Portuguese health authority website (in Portuguese).
Healthcare
The rules on access to healthcare will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
You should get a free European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before leaving the UK. After 31 December 2020, your UK-issued EHIC might not be valid.
The EHIC entitles you to state provided medical treatment that may become necessary during your trip. Any treatment provided is on the same terms as Portuguese nationals. If you don’t have your EHIC with you or you’ve lost it, you can call the Department of Health Overseas Healthcare Team (+44 191 218 1999) to get a Provisional Replacement Certificate.
It is important to take out comprehensive travel insurance that includes cover for emergency medical treatment and associated costs. The existing EHIC arrangements are not an alternative to travel insurance, as some health-related costs, including for medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment, are not covered. Read more about what your travel insurance should cover.
If you’re living in Portugal, you can also find more information on healthcare for residents in our Living In Portugal guide.
If you feel unwell, seek medical attention or check the Portuguese health service website for information on how you can get advice in English. Consider carrying an Emergency ID Card to help the health services assist you in an emergency.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 112 and ask for an ambulance. If you are referred to a medical facility for treatment you should contact your insurance/medical assistance company immediately.
