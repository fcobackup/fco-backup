Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.

understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Zimbabwe
Zimbabwe currently has some exceptional measures in place to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a curfew between midnight and 5:30am, which is being enforced by the security services. You should comply with these requirements wherever you are staying in Zimbabwe.
It is compulsory to wear a face mask covering the nose and mouth whenever you are outside of your home.
Public transport is limited. Intercity travel is permitted. All journeys operate under current COVID-19 restrictions.
Accommodation
You should ensure you have accommodation for the period of your stay, as some hotels may close at short notice.
Public spaces and services
Everyone in a public place must observe social distancing (i.e. keep at least one metre apart), sanitize their hands and wear a face mask.
Non-essential business can open at their discretion as long as they adhere to the above-mentioned measures of social distancing, sanitizing and mask-wearing.
Restaurants, hotels, liquor suppliers, bars and nightclubs can open from 8am to 10pm (license dependent) to fully vaccinated customers, subject to strict adherence to COVID-19 protocols.
Healthcare in Zimbabwe
If you take regular medication, you should ensure you have a sufficient supply and make sure you can access a repeat prescription in the event of travel delays. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwean pharmacies do not accept prescriptions issued in the UK. There is no reciprocal healthcare agreement between Zimbabwe and the UK. For contact details of English speaking doctors, visit our list of healthcare providers.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your medical practitioner for advice.
The government of Zimbabwe has said that anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be detained at a place of isolation for 10 days.
