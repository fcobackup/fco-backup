There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Taiwan.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Taiwan, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
As a result of entry and travel restrictions, a number of flights out of Taiwan have been cancelled, and this may change without notice as the situation progresses. Contact your airline or tour operator for the latest information.
Indirect flights from Taiwan to the UK are still currently available although some involve a change of airline at the transit airport.
Flights are subject to change at very short notice, so you should regularly check the British Office Taipei’s Twitter and Facebook pages for updates, paying particular attention to restrictions placed on transits via Japan and South Korea. You do not need a Facebook/Twitter account to access these pages.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
Taxis and public transport systems are operating normally in Taiwan. From 3 April, the wearing of face masks is mandatory on all public transport. If you use public transport and are not wearing a face mask, you may be fined up to NT$15,000. Be aware that some taxi drivers may refuse to take a passenger who is not wearing a face mask.
