can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Zimbabwe
Zimbabwe currently has some COVID-19 measures in place, though enforcement is inconsistent. By law, it is compulsory to wear a face mask covering the nose and mouth whenever you are on public transport, in workplaces and in public areas indoors. Masks are also compulsory in public outdoor areas for those who are unvaccinated. Everyone in an indoor public place must observe social distancing (i.e. keep at least one metre apart), sanitize their hands and wear a face mask. Everyone in an outdoor public place must observe social distancing, sanitize their hands and wear a face mask if they have not received at least 2 doses of a World Health Organisation-approved vaccine.
There is a curfew between midnight and 05:30am .
Healthcare in Zimbabwe
If you take regular medication, you should ensure you have a sufficient supply and make sure you can access a repeat prescription in the event of travel delays. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require one in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwean pharmacies do not accept prescriptions issued in the UK. There is no reciprocal healthcare agreement between Zimbabwe and the UK. For contact details of English speaking doctors, visit our list of healthcare providers.
