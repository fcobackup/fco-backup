The Falkland Islands authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Cruise vessels will be allowed to call into the Falkland Islands if:
Everyone on board has been on board for a minimum of 10 days
No-one on board is suffering from symptoms which makes them a “suspect case” for Covid-19 (see air travel section).
If you arrive into the Falkland Islands by air you are expected to self-isolate for a period of 14 days if you develop symptoms after arrival which makes you a suspect case. You should call the hospital on 28000 for advice if you need medical help.
A suspect case is a person with a fever and a cough or shortness of breath, if there is no other explanation for those symptoms.
Any British Nationals who are stranded in the Falkland Islands and unable to return to the UK please contact Government House at the following email address: ghouse@sec.gov.fk
