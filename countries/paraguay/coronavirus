Travel in Paraguay
In March 2020, Paraguayan authorities declared a nationwide health-related State of Emergency, putting in place restrictions, which were relaxed in phases.
There will be a ban on general public transport services to the countryside from 27 March to 4 April 2021, as a measure to prevent the spread of the virus. However, normal public transport services within the metropolitan area of Asuncion will not be affected.
There is a ban on all non-essential movement nationwide from 27 March to 4 April. There are exceptions to buy food, go to the pharmacy or hospital, and for essential workers. You should, therefore, stay at your accommodation unless necessary to go out. Wearing a facemask is mandatory at all times and observing sanitary measures (washing of hands and observing physical distance). Restrictions on free movement are in place between 8pm and 5am.

Healthcare in Paraguay
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, dial the Ministry of Health hotline at 154.
The public healthcare system varies across the country, and in some cities in Paraguay, the additional burden of treating Covid-19 patients might affect services such as accident and emergency care. Some private hospitals might not accept credit card payments for admissions and only accept patients with valid health insurance. Short-term foreign visitors are required to demonstrate proof of medical insurance before boarding their flight to Paraguay. Check with your airline carrier.
Check if your travel or health insurance has comprehensive cover for coronavirus and refer to official channels in your location for further details.
People with COVID-19 symptoms, that have recently come in contact with someone with COVID-19, or have recently travelled internationally are eligible for testing by booking an appointment by calling the Ministry of Health’s hotline at 154, but results from public laboratories may take up to a week to arrive.
