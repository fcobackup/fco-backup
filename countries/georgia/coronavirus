Georgia has put measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). For information on how to return to the UK from Georgia, see Return to the UK
Entry and borders
From midnight 18 March, until further notice, foreign citizens will not be allowed to enter the country. The ban will also apply to foreigners with Georgian residence permits. Anyone arriving in Georgia from 20 March will face compulsory 14-day quarantine. You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication in carry-on luggage.
The Georgian authorities recognise that some non-Georgian residents may be unable to renew their entry permits in due time due to border closures. They have informed the British Embassy that they plan to amend the relevant legislation to allow for these exceptional circumstances and that those who cannot renew their permits for coronavirus reasons will not be penalised. The British Embassy in Tbilisi will publish the revised rules on Facebook and Twitter, once confirmed by the Georgian Government
Local measures
A State of Emergency is in place until 22 May. Gatherings of more than 3 people are banned. Fines of 3,000 GEL for individuals and 15,000 for legal entities for violation of restrictions are in place. Those over 70 should only leave home to go the nearest grocery, pharmacy or medical centre. There is a nationwide curfew from 21.00-06.00.
All public transport has been suspended until further notice. In areas where there is an unexplained case of coronavirus, lockdown measures may be introduced without warning. There is an indefinite ban on entering or leaving Tbilisi and Rustavi. All shops with the exception of food shops, pharmacies, petrol stations, banks, post offices and car repair workshops are now closed. Cafes and restaurants only offer take-out service.
The Government has announced a six-stage plan to loosen restrictions, starting with the resumption of private car travel on 27 April, followed by the re-opening of the construction industry, car repair workshops and relaxation of travel restrictions into Batumi and Kutaisi on 5 May. Progress between each stage is expected to take two weeks and depends on epidemiological conditions.
Healthcare response
A number of medical facilities have already been prepared specifically for coronavirus patients, with further facilities in reserve. If you think you might have the symptoms of coronavirus you should call the Georgian Emergency number 112. There are also Hotlines for the Health Ministry on 1505 and the Centre for Disease Control on 116 001.
You must wear a facemask in enclosed spaces such as shops.
