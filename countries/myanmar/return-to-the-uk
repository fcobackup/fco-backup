The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises all British Nationals to leave the country by commercial, unless there is an urgent need to stay.
The military have extended the suspension of normal commercial passenger flights until 31 May 2021. However, the airport is open and some ‘relief’ flights are available for those seeking to leave Myanmar. Most of these are commercially bookable.
See Flights (below). Land borders are also closed.
If you are not able to leave Myanmar at this time, you are advised to stay home and stay safe. If you need to leave home for essential reasons, you should do so quickly, avoiding crowds. If you remain, you should see advice on staying in Myanmar during coronavirus.
Flights
There are limited options for British nationals looking to return to the UK.
The military have extended the suspension of normal commercial passenger flights until 31 May 2021. However, the airport is open and some ‘relief’ flights are available for those seeking to leave Myanmar. Most of these are commercially bookable.
Flights are currently available to a number of destinations, most frequently to Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Seoul. Some international airlines (such as Singapore Airlines) are operating flights to these destinations, which can be booked through their websites. In addition, Myanmar National Airlines and Myanmar Airways International are also operating flights. Booking with these airlines may need to be done in person and using cash, or via a travel agent.
Other flight options may become available and travellers should keep in close touch with their travel agents as the situation is changeable.
All travellers should check with the embassies of respective transit countries for the latest transit, entry and Covid-19 testing requirements before making ticket purchases. You should note that Kuala Lumpur and Singapore do not currently require a COVID negative test for transit.
You should ensure that you meet the baggage allowance restrictions for all your flights, as some travellers have found the allowance on the second leg to be lower than that of the first. If you exceed the allowance on any leg of your journey excess baggage charges will be applied, and will only be payable in US dollars.
Your journey home: before you leave Myanmar
You should be aware of current UK entry requirements. To enter the UK, you are required to:
Complete a passenger locator form;
Book a travel test package for arrival in UK. This costs £210. You must take a COVID-19 test on or before day 2 for variant surveillance and a test on or after day 8 to check that you do not have COVID-19. Use the booking portal to book your travel test package (this is administered by CTM); and
Provide proof of a negative coronavirus test.
You are normally required to show proof of a negative coronavirus test to your airline before being allowed to board.
However, as of 21 February, you do not need to take a test if you began your journey to the UK from Myanmar. The present situation in Myanmar means that it is not reasonable to seek to obtain a pre-departure coronavirus test in that country before departure to the UK. The guidance will be reviewed regularly. Sign up to get an email alert whenever this page is updated. Passengers travelling to the UK can request a letter from the British Embassy Yangon, outlining the UK position on pre-departure coronavirus tests. You should send full details of name, passport number and confirmed flight details to Yangon.Consular@fcdo.gov.uk with ‘Pre-departure Test Letter Request’ in the subject line.
If you do not have a valid British Passport, the British Embassy can issue emergency travel documents or emergency passports should you need to leave the country in the near future. You should call the Embassy for further assistance or contact Yangon.Consular@fcdo.gov.uk.

Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’) See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Help and support
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. For information on financial support you can access whilst abroad, see our financial assistance guidance.
