This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Argentina as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Argentina to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Argentina
Argentina remains under a nationwide quarantine until at least midnight on 17 July. The restrictions imposed vary significantly between provinces. In most parts of Argentina, you are required to cover your nose and mouth with a facemask or other garment whenever you go out in public. In the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires you must stay in your accommodation. In other parts of the country free movement is allowed within each jurisdiction provided that social distancing rules are adhered to. In all cases you are allowed to travel to an airport if you have a flight booked and you can make single person journeys to buy necessities, such as medicines or foodstuffs, in your local area.
You should check what measures apply in your location in the Ministry of Health website (in Spanish). You could be subject to a financial penalty if you do not abide by local regulations.
Visas
The 90-day permission for tourists to stay in Argentina is being extended each month by 30 days, if your original 90 days expired after 17 March. The latest extension was announced on 17 June.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Argentina, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
