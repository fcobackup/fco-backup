From 4 July, Barbados is exempt from the FCO advice against all non-essential international travel. This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
If you arrive in Barbados without being tested for COVID-19, you will be subjected to a mandatory test on arrival at the Concorde Experience facility which is next to the airport. The cost of the test is US$150. You will need to isolate in your accommodation until the test results are provided. This can take a maximum of 48 hours.
Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be taken to a Barbados government quarantine facility at Harrison Point, St Lucy.
