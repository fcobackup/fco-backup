It is currently not possible for British nationals to enter or exit Mongolia due to restrictions imposed by the Mongolian Government, including the suspension of all international flights and rail until at least 30 April, the closure to foreign nationals of all road border crossings to and from Russia, and the closure of all borders between China and Mongolia. Any British nationals who need to extend their visas should contact the Immigration Agency of Mongolia, telephone +976 1800 1882 or +976 9314 1009.
A limited number of charter flights to locations outside Mongolia were arranged by the Government of Mongolia between the 15th and 18th of March. If further charter flights are arranged information will be shared on these pages and on the British Embassy Ulaanbaatar Twitter and Facebook sites. If you are looking to leave Mongolia, please send contact details and a photo of the ID page of your passport to consular.mongolia@fco.gov.uk.
Around 6,500 British nationals visit Mongolia annually. Most visits are trouble-free.
Mongolia takes border security very seriously and foreign nationals aren’t routinely permitted access to border areas. The authorities can regard zones of up to 100km inside the border as a border area. If you wish to travel in these areas, you must get permission from the State Frontier Guard Authority. Only a few specified land border crossings are open to foreigners. See Border crossings
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Mongolia, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism.
Avoid going out on foot alone at night. Foreigners stand out and can be targeted for attack because of their comparative wealth. See Crime.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
