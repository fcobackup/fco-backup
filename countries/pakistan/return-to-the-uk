We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Pakistan. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Pakistan authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.

This includes British nationals holding a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis.

This round of chartered flights will include 3 direct flights from Islamabad to Heathrow, 4 direct flights from Islamabad to Manchester, 2 direct flights from Lahore to Heathrow, and 1 direct flight from Lahore to Manchester.
