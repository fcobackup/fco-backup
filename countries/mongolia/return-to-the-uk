All scheduled commercial flights have been cancelled but there are occasional charter flights leaving Mongolia. The UK government is working closely with the Mongolian authorities regarding charter flights and options for British people to return to the UK.
Flights
The government of Mongolia has announced the following charter flights:
21 April: Seoul
23 April: Seoul
26 April: Seoul ( Korean Air)
27 April: Seoul
29 April: Frankfurt
The British Embassy understands that British nationals may be able to purchase tickets for the outward legs from Ulaanbaatar. British nationals wanting to purchase tickets for these flights should contact Mongolian Airlines (MIAT) directly on +976 1133 3999. Tickets for the Korean Air and Turkish Airlines flights should be booked directly with those airlines.
The British Embassy cannot guarantee seats on any of these flights. You will be responsible for payment of the ticket. Individuals who book on any of these flights are responsible for making their own onward travel arrangements. You should also check FCDO Travel Advice regarding onward flights to the UK from the destinations listed above.
British nationals who require support to leave Mongolia should send their name, contact details and a photo of the ID page of their passport to consular.mongolia@fco.gov.uk.
As further information becomes available it will be shared on these pages and on the British Embassy Ulaanbaatar Twitter and Facebook sites.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when youâ€™re back in the UK.
