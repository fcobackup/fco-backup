Before you travel check that: 
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need 
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation 
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant. 
Emergency medical number 
Dial 1990 and ask for an ambulance. 
Alternatively, contact the Accident Service at Colombo General Hospital on 011 269 1111.
Contact your insurance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment. 
Vaccinations and health risks 
At least 8 weeks before your trip check: 
the latest information on vaccinations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Sri Lanka guide 
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page 
All regions of Sri Lanka experience outbreaks of the mosquito-borne dengue fever. Take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. 
Medication 
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.

Healthcare facilities in Sri Lanka 
Emergency medical treatment outside main cities is not readily available and you may have to be brought to Colombo for treatment. Treatment in private hospitals can be expensive and the options for repatriation to the UK or neighbouring countries in an emergency are limited and very expensive. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
