Crime
Crime rates are generally low, but burglaries and armed robberies do occur. Safeguard valuables and cash, particularly at the beach. Use a hotel safe where practical, and keep copies of important documents, including your passport.  
Road travel
You should bring a valid International Driving Permit if you wish to hire a car. Traffic is light but the majority of roads are in poor condition, particularly outside the capital. Most roads are unlit. You should avoid being on the road at night (there are animals on the roads) and during periods of heavy rainfall (landslips and mudslides can occur).
There are shared taxis on Sao Tome, but no other public transport in Sao Tome and Principe.
Air travel
The EU has published a list of air carriers that are subject to an operating ban or restrictions within the community.
Seats on the small aircraft that operate between the main island of Sao Tome and the smaller island of Príncipe need to be booked well in advance or there is a risk that you could become stranded.
Political Situation
Sao Tome and Principe is generally peaceful. Economic difficulties and political rows over the handling of investments in the islands’ development occasionally lead to civil unrest. You should avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings.
