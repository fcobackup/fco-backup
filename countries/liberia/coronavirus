Liberia has put measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Preventative measures
A nationwide State of Emergency, which includes a range of measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, in place for 60 days from 10 April. Security forces will enforce measures. You should adhere to all rules and seek information from local authorities. Details could change and further restrictions be imposed.
Under the State of Emergency, all 15 counties will be quarantined from 10 April until further notice. Movement between counties will be prohibited (except between Montserrado and Margibi counties, which are quarantined as a single unit). A permit is required for essential travel between counties.
All residents were ordered to stay at home for 30 days from 10 April, with a curfew in place from 15:00-06:00. Government has extended this ‘Stay at Home’ order, by two further weeks, to 24 May. You may only leave your home for essential journeys (food purchases or health care needs), restricted to your local community. Only one member of your household may go out for a maximum of one hour. If you go out in public, you must wear a mask. Essential businesses (e.g. supermarkets and pharmacies) must close by 15:00 each day. If you are an essential worker (e.g. government, utilities, food production, healthcare, etc.) you may be exempt from some restrictions.
Preventative measures introduced on 22 March continue to apply, including mandatory hand washing with soap and clean water at all premises, limits on gatherings and numbers of persons allowed in public premises at any one time. Some offices and businesses may also require temperature checks.
Liberian authorities have advised community members to report those showing coronavirus symptoms (coughing, fever, and difficulty breathing) by calling 4455.
Travel restrictions
All travellers arriving in Liberia will be screened for the coronavirus. On arrival at entry points, staff will check your temperature and you must wash your hands with soap and water. You may be taken to quarantine.
Given the rise of the number of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) the Government of Liberia has announced the suspension of all commercial flights (except cargo, charter and special flights). Currently there are no scheduled passenger services to Liberia. Special charter flights are allowed with prior permission; cargo flights are still permitted.
Currently all land borders (with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire) are closed to travellers. Ports remain open.
Keep up to date with real-time information from your airline, tour operator or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and precautionary observation requirements with no advance notice.
Local measures
Preventative measures and travel restrictions could change at short notice. If you are planning travel to Liberia, you should check Government of Liberia Facebook pages frequently for updated information. The Government of Liberia usually posts announcements on the following Facebook pages:
Ministry of Information, Culture & Tourism (MICAT)
Executive Mansion – Liberia
National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL)
Visas
If you are unable to leave Liberia and your visa is due to expire, you must apply for an extension. The maximum extension period is 60 days. It is only possible to extend your visa once. To apply for an extension in Monrovia, you should visit the Immigration Office at Gbarngaye’s Town, 24th Street, Sinkor. The office is open 09:00-15:00 Monday to Friday. You should ask for the Registration Section. You must bring your passport and pay a fee of US$25. If you are staying outside Montserrado County, you should contact your local Immigration Office to seek a visa extension authorised by the Immigration County Commander. If you have already extended your visa once and it is due to expire, you must apply for a residence permit. In this case, please contact the British Embassy for advice by emailing Monrovia.GeneralEnquiries@fco.gov.uk
Treatment
Patients who test positive for coronavirus will be transferred to government treatment facilities. Patients displaying coronavirus symptoms will be transferred to a government quarantine facility. Private medical facilities are currently not permitted to test for or treat coronavirus.
Quarantine
There is a high risk for British nationals of being put into 14 days of quarantine, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. Liberian quarantine centres are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards.
You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate for 14 days even after you have arrived in Liberia, if you have been to an affected country, or develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government treatment centre. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.
All foreign citizens at Precautionary Observation Centre (POCs) will have their passports removed and held by NPHIL. You will be given a copy of your passport to retain whilst in the POC.
If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. The British Embassy cannot provide POC facilities. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to quarantine or a government treatment centre.
Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), will also be taken to a POC (quarantine) for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in 14 days of quarantine.
