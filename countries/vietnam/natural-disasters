Tropical cyclones affect the eastern coastal regions. The season normally runs from May to November, but tropical cyclones can occur outside this period. Monitor approaching storms on the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting and Japan Meteorological Agency websites and follow the advice of the local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you are caught up in a storm.
