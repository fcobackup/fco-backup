Domestic flights are operating.
Curfew measures for all provinces in the Republic of Panama
From 8 December, unless you are under 14-day quarantine or have Covid-19 symptoms, you can now leave your home/accommodation between the hours of 5 am and 9 pm. A curfew is in place between 9 pm and 5am from Monday to Sunday. ‘Salvoconductos’ (permissions) are only necessary for those occupations that require movement during curfew hours. If you are arriving internationally when the curfew is in effect, you are allowed to travel to your accommodation providing you carry proof that you have just left a flight.
The periods when you can leave your accommodation are no longer restricted, other than the curfew timings above. You are allowed to exercise with no limitations on distance from your accommodation.
Places of worship, parks, sports facilities and social areas (including those of buildings and open air areas of private clubs, such as tennis courts, golf and other sporting activities that do not involve physical contact) and swimming pools are open with 25% capacity and social distancing of 2 metres.
Cultural activities (such as museums and theatres) have resumed with restrictions of 50% capacity. The Panamanian Ministry of Health has specified that the relaxation in measures does not include social activity in groups, celebrations, contact sports or any activity that does not respect social distancing.
Gyms in apartment complexes are to remain closed.

Healthcare in Panama

You can access the Panamanian public healthcare system on the same terms as Panamanians. Coronavirus tests in the public system, for those who meet the clinical requirement to be tested, will be free of charge.
On 15 March 2020, Panamanian authorities announced new restrictions on access to medical services for routine care, as well as widespread closures of commercial and leisure establishments. Further restrictions were announced on 20 March 2020. Routine healthcare – including elective surgeries and consultations with doctors – in both hospitals and other clinics has been restricted to people with chronic illness, children and those who are pregnant. From 13 May 2020, private clinics can operate, provided they comply with the protocols established by the Panamanian Ministry of Health.
