The system for British nationals wishing to apply for Hajj from outside Saudi Arabia has changed. British nationals now need to apply directly to the Saudi authorities.
The Saudi authorities’ Motawif website for Hajj 2022 applications was open for applications from 10 to 13 June. On 21 June, a Motawif update confirmed that they were aware of a number of cases of problems related to completing payment and booking confirmations. We are aware that not all problems have been resolved, and continue to seek information from the Saudi authorities.
On 22 June, a Motawif update reminded successful applicants to use the form to complete Hajj Visa applications. Motawif will issue a further update regarding pending applications. The contact email address for all queries on Hajj packages is: care@motawif.com.sa and telephone numbers are +44 20 3814 3314 (from UK) or 800 89 12 027 (from Saudi Arabia).
The Saudi authorities have not confirmed the process for Hajj 2023.
If you are visiting from abroad, as a ‘vaccinated visitor’ (except if you are in exempted categories), before travelling you must complete a Registration Immunisation Information Form on the Muqeem website.
Umrah permits are not issued during Hajj. After Hajj is completed, if you are already in Saudi Arabia, you can apply to perform Umrah through the official Ministry of Hajj app ‘Eatmarna’ and also ‘Tawakkalna’. You can download Eatmarna using these links for Android users and Apple users. For more information, visit the Ministry of Hajj page or Twitter @mohu_en. You can perform Umrah on a tourist visa.
If you want to perform Umrah or Hajj, follow announcements on FCDO official social media channels @ukinsaudiarabia on Twitter or on Facebook, and guidance from local authorities. @Motawif_SA provides information on the new system for people wishing to perform Hajj from outside Saudi Arabia.
Before you travel for pilgrimage, carefully consider the information and advice on the website of the Saudi Arabia Embassy in London, and in the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s (NaTHNaC) factsheet.
