The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Travelling to Azerbaijan
Options for travelling to Azerbaijan are extremely limited. Check with your travel agent or call Azerbaijan Airlines in London +44 1414 160 888 for further information. There is also some information on the British Embassy Baku’s Facebook page.
The use of a medical mask will be required at all times whilst at the airport and on the flight. It is mandatory to keep the mask on at all times except for specific requirements for example at border control, at the request of an airport official or whilst eating.
Hand luggage will not be allowed on flights incoming to Azerbaijan apart from smaller personal items such as a handbag or brief case. Check with your airline for the latest hand-luggage allowances and rules introduced to combat COVID-19 on-board your flight.
Azerbaijan’s land borders with all neighbouring countries remain closed.
Screening
All passengers travelling to or from Azerbaijan will require a negative COVID-19 test. The test itself can be taken more than 48 hours before your flight but the certificate showing the negative test result will only be accepted if issued within 48 hours before the flight. You should seek to have your test results via email and printed off, or a paper certificate. You may be tested again for COVID-19 and have your temperature checked on arrival into Azerbaijan. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
The Cabinet of Ministers has decreed that passengers who do not test positive on arrival will not be required to stay in a state quarantine facility. The relevant decree can be found on the Azerbaijan Airlines’ (AZAL) website. However, you will still need to self-isolate for 14 days and will have to abide by the restrictions on movement which remain in force for everybody in Azerbaijan.
Foreign citizens who do not provide a negative COVID-19 test certificate will not be allowed to enter Azerbaijan. Registration and the boarding of flights will be conducted on the basis of this.
If you are arriving to Azerbaijan via a third country (i.e. not directly from the UK) you will still be required to produce a COVID-19 negative test certificate on arrival even if your airline does not request one for boarding part of your journey. In the absence of this certificate you will be denied entry to Azerbaijan and returned to the country of origin on the next available flight at your own expense.
Quarantine requirements
Anyone who displays symptoms of COVID-19 will be directed to the medical station at the airport. From there the case will be reported to the Emergency Medical Services. If you are taken in to state quarantine facilities or hospitalised you should inform the British Embassy. Call: +994 12 437 7878. You may hear a message stating that our offices are closed, however, we are available 24/7 – please stay on the line to select the option for ‘calling about an emergency involving a British national’ to speak to a Consular duty officer.” You can also reach us via Facebook
Testing on departure
All passengers travelling to or from Azerbaijan will require a negative COVID-19 test. The test itself can be taken more than 48 hours before your flight but the certificate showing the negative test result will only be accepted if issued within 48 hours before the flight. You should seek to have your test results via email and printed off, or a paper certificate.
A list of laboratories testing for Coronavirus accredited by the State Health Agency (TABIB) can be found on Azerbaijan Airlines’ (AZAL) website
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals travelling to Azerbaijan need to get a visa in advance.
The Asan Visa (e-Visa) service is temporarily suspended, no new e-visas are being issued and those issued but not yet used have been annulled.
You can still apply for a visa through the Azerbaijan Embassy-affiliated Visa Service Centre in the UK. You should apply for a visa at least one month ahead of your intended travel date. All applicants must provide confirmation they have tested negative for COVID-19. Visit the official Visa Centre website for more information.
Make sure you check the duration of your visa immediately to avoid overstaying unintentionally. Your visa should be valid when departing Azerbaijan.
E-visas are normally valid for 30 days and are single entry. The Azerbaijani authorities have agreed that e-visas can be extended in some circumstances. For more information contact the State Migration Service email: info@migration.gov.az.
On 24 March the authorities announced that foreign nationals can extend their stay in Azerbaijan for up to 60 days. A fee will be payable. Visit the State Migration Service of the Republic of Azerbaijan website. Their address is:
202 Binagadi Highway
3123 Block
Binagadi district
Baku city
AZ1114
Azerbaijan Republic
e-mail: info@migration.gov.az
Telephone: +994 (0)12 562 56 23 or +994 (0)12 562 57 73
Alternatively, try the Migration Information Centre: telephone: 919 (in country calls only).
If you overstay you can obtain an ‘Exit Permit’ letter (an official letter giving permission to leave Azerbaijan within 48 hours) from the State Migration Service before you depart. You will be liable to a fine of between AZN300 to AZN400. You should get a receipt.
If you have extended your stay in Azerbaijan due to restrictions on travel this is now considered to be valid for an indefinite period of time until restrictions on flights to and from Azerbaijan are lifted. Once the restrictions are lifted then you will need to leave the country shortly after and apply for a new visa, or the relevant residence permit. This extension applies to both 30 day and 60 day visas.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months when you enter Azerbaijan.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Azerbaijan.
Registration
If you’re staying in Azerbaijan for longer than 15 days you must register with the State Migration Service within 15 days of arrival by either visiting the State Migration Service in person or online. Hotels may provide this service for their guests, but visitors staying in apartments or private residences will have to register by themselves. Each traveller is responsible for ensuring that the registration has been completed.
If you’re staying longer than 30 days, you will need to obtain a temporary residence card unless applying to extend your visa on compassionate grounds. For more information refer to the State Migration Service.
Dual nationals
Azerbaijan doesn’t allow adults (18 years or older) to hold dual nationality. You may be refused entry, denied departure or even face criminal liability if you’re 18 years or older and are found to be holding both an Azerbaijani passport and a passport of a different nationality. If you’re a British passport holder with links to Azerbaijan (through birth or otherwise) and wish to check your nationality status contact the State Migration Service before you travel. Children under 18 years old holding a second nationality shouldn’t face any difficulties.
