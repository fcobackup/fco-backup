Hurricane Otis
Hurricane Otis hit the Pacific south coast of Mexico around Acapulco as a Category 5 hurricane on 24 October with continued hurricane conditions on 25 October.
There are reports of significant damage to infrastructure in Acapulco and along Mexico’s southern coast between Zihuatenejo and Punta Maldonado, including hotels, transport, communications, and health services. The 95D Federal Toll Road (Autopista Del Sol) has now reopened, but roads in the region have been subject to flooding, mudslides and traffic accidents. Zihuatenejo airport is open. Acapulco airport is closed until further notice. You can find more information on the status of airports on the OMA account.
The post-storm situation remains dangerous. Heavy rains from Otis are likely to produce further flash flooding and mudslides. Be aware that historically more accidents occur post-storm than during it. The storm is not the only hazard; many electric lines may be down and some buildings may not be structurally sound. See the extreme weather and natural hazards for further advice about how to prepare for travel during hurricane season, what to do ahead of a storm and what to expect in the aftermath of a hurricane.
The national guard have deployed to the region to help with disaster efforts. Local Authorities have called for those in the affected zone to stay inside and take precautions, including staying informed about shelter locations. Shelter locations in Acapulco are also available on: UK in Mexico twitter. You should follow the advice of local authorities. For more information, see Hurricanes.
