This page has information on travelling to Paraguay.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Paraguay set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Paraguay’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Fully vaccinated travellers aged 12 years and older can enter Paraguay by proving their full vaccination status: one or two doses, depending on the vaccine’s dose requirements for a complete scheme. Travellers aged 11 years and under are exempt from presenting proof of vaccination (see ‘Children and young people’).
The vaccination certificate must contain the following information:
Traveller’s name
Date of birth
Document or passport number
Identification of the vaccine manufacturer
Batch number of applied doses
Dose application date
Vaccination certificates must be in English, French, Portuguese or Spanish. Certificates in other languages, including coded languages, will not be accepted.
Entry to Paraguay upon arrival may be refused for not adhering to these requirements.
For further information on entry requirements, you can visit Paraguay’s Health Ministry website (in Spanish).
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Paraguay.
Paraguay will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
All travellers aged 12 years and older who are not fully vaccinated are required to show a negative COVID-19 test result (RT-PCR, LAMP or NAAT) taken no more than 72 hours prior to travel.
Children and young people
Children aged 11 years and under are exempt from the requirement to present proof of vaccination or a pre-departure test.
Exceptions
Land transit in border regions, including for commercial reasons, is allowed for a visit of up to 72 hours and up to 30 km without any of the aforementioned requirements for those who can show proof of residency in a border city.
Travellers aged 12 years and over who have been infected with COVID-19 between 10 and 90 days before entering Paraguay are also exempt from the requirement to present proof of vaccination or a pre-departure test. Travellers should prove this situation by showing their positive COVID-19 test result (RT-PCR, LAMP or NAAT) or a proof of a positive antigen test.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Paraguay, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British Passport holders do not need a visa to enter Paraguay. On presentation of a valid British passport you will normally be granted a 90-day stay in the country.
You must make sure on arrival that your passport is stamped by an immigration official, dated and signed. Anybody without an entry stamp in their passport will be fined when they leave the country. This is particularly important for anyone entering Paraguay at a land border, typically the crossing between Ciudad del Este and Foz de Iguazu (Brazil). Sometimes long distance bus drivers tell foreign nationals that they can complete immigration formalities in Asunción. This is not true, and visitors will incur a fine if they do not get their passport stamped at the point of entry.
If you wish to extend your stay for another 90-day period, seek advice from the Paraguayan Dirección General de Migraciones website (in Spanish).
If you are travelling to Paraguay to work or study you should contact the Paraguayan Embassy in London.
Travelling with children
If you’re under 18, travelling across borders in the region without one or both parents, it’s advisable to have written permission to travel from both parents, duly certified by the Paraguayan Embassy in London, or your nearest Paraguayan Embassy. Single parents or other adults travelling alone with children should be aware that immigration officers often request documentary evidence of parental responsibility before allowing lone parents to enter the country or, in some cases, before permitting the children to leave the country. For more information on this contact the Paraguayan Embassy in London.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
All travellers to and from Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Venezuela are obliged to present an International Yellow Fever Vaccination Certificate to authorise their entry and exit of the country.
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Paraguay. The validity requirements are the same as for full validity British passports. If you plan to travel to Argentina or the US you will need a visa in your ETD. You must contact the nearest Embassies of those countries in order to apply.
Be aware that the British Embassy in Asunción does not produce ETDs. In case you require an ETD it will be done so through the British Embassy in Buenos Aires.
