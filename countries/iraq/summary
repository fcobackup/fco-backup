The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Specific advice for Iraq remains in place:
The FCO advise against all travel to Iraq including the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.
Airports across federal Iraq and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq have now re-opened for international flights. See Return to the UK
A lockdown across federal Iraq (except for the Kurdistan Region of Iraq) will be in force from 30 July to 9 August 2020. You should comply with local authority measures during this period. See Staying during coronavirus
The Kurdistan Region of Iraq is subject to strict travel restrictions between provinces which are often introduced at short notice. These are published through local media and on the Ministry of Interior website.
The security situation throughout Iraq remains uncertain, and could deteriorate quickly. On 8 January 2020, Iran fired missiles against two military bases in Iraq containing US personnel, one close to Erbil International Airport. No foreign casualties were reported.
Following the attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March, and subsequent US airstrikes, tensions may be raised across the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
Large protests have been taking place in central Baghdad and across Iraq since October 2019. On 31 December and 1 January, violent demonstrations took place outside the US Embassy in Baghdad. There is a possibility of further protests in Baghdad.
There may be increased attention on Western nationals and interests in Iraq. If you’re in Iraq or decide to travel, make sure you have robust security arrangements and contingency plans in place and keep these under review. You should keep up to date with the latest developments across the country, including via the media and this travel advice, avoid any rallies, marches or processions, and follow the instructions of local authorities. See Political and security situation
In the event of a sudden deterioration in the security station, there may be limits to the assistance the FCO can provide, depending on the security and transport situation. You should not assume that the FCO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country.
According to Iraqi law you must have a visa before you travel, even if you’re intending to travel to the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. See Visas
The Iraqi Prime Minister announced the defeat of Daesh in Iraq on 9 December 2017. However, terrorists are still very likely to try to carry out attacks in Iraq. You should remain vigilant and monitor media reports. See Terrorism
There’s also a high threat of kidnapping throughout the country, from both Daesh and other terrorist and militant groups, which can be motivated by criminality or terrorism. You should review your security arrangements regularly and consider carefully any travel plans around the country. See Kidnap
Turkey conducts regular military action in the north of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) and on occasion, further south. There is particular risk in mountainous areas, particularly around Qandil, Makhmur, and near the border with Turkey. Crossing points along the Iraq-Turkey border may also be affected. See Kurdistan Region
The government of Iraq is taking measures to improve the structural integrity of the Mosul Dam as there is a risk the dam could fail. It’s currently impossible to accurately predict if or when this might occur. See Local travel
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in Iraq. The British Embassy in Baghdad and the British Consulate-General in Erbil operate a limited consular service by appointment only. The Embassy and Consulate-General’s ability to visit locations across Iraq is limited and travel to unsecure areas to deliver consular services may not be possible.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
