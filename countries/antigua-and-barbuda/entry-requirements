Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Testing / screening on arrival
All passengers 12 years and older arriving by air in Antigua and Barbuda, including those transiting the country, must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken no more than seven days before arrival. Further health screening is in place at VC Bird International Airport and the private jet terminal for all international arrivals. The measures are subject to change but may include mandatory temperature and travel history checks, completion of a Health Declaration Form and further testing for Coronavirus. You should expect long waiting times on arrival.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Passengers arriving by sea are not required to provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test but must enter via Nevis Street Pier in St John’s and follow the screening and quarantine instructions of Port Health.
Visitors instructed by the local authorities to take a Coronavirus test on arrival may be asked to pay a fee of US$ 100 in cash.
Quarantine requirements
On arrival, you will be subject to health screening. The Ministry of Health and Wellness of Antigua and Barbuda advise that all arrivals will be monitored for coronavirus for up to 14 days.
In practice, tourists with pre-booked hotel accommodation will normally be permitted to travel to their accommodation after screening. If you’re staying with family, friends, in private accommodation or in your own place of residence, you will be subject to an interview to determine your suitability to leave for your private accommodation arrangements. You may be required to self-isolate for a period up to 14 days, at the discretion of the Quarantine Authorities. Those not deemed to have suitable private accommodation arrangements will be obliged to remain in government quarantine at their expense for between seven and 14 days.
Failure to comply with any order, guideline or direction of the Quarantine Authority is considered an offence carrying a fine of up to XCD10,000 and/or six months imprisonment.
