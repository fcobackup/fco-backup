Travel in St Vincent and the Grenadines
Until international commercial flights resume, taxi service from Argyle International Airport is limited.
Coronavirus related restrictions have eased in recent weeks, though hygiene measures and physical and social distancing is still recommended. You may still be required to use sanitizer or wear a face mask in some shops or businesses, and to wash your hands at special washing stations before entry. If taking local private minibus transport, you may feel safer wearing a face mask.
Accommodation
Not all hotels and private rentals have re-opened or fully re-opened to the public. If making a booking, you should check whether there are any coronavirus restrictions or protocols to observe.
Public places and services
There are no lockdowns or curfews. Physical distancing, including at weddings and funerals, is still recommended but rarely enforced. Otherwise, the few restrictions that there were (e.g. numbers of people allowed to travel on private minibus taxi services and certain businesses or shops only allowing a set number of people in at any one time) are loosening. The amplified music ban, which impacted social gatherings, has now been lifted. Some shops or businesses may still require customers to wear face masks, or to wash or sanitize hands before entry, or adhere to 3-6 feet space markings when queuing.
