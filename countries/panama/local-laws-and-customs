Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

Donâ€™t become involved with drugs in any way. Possession of even very small quantities can lead to imprisonment of up to 15 years. The judicial process is slow and prison conditions are very harsh.
Simply being in the company of someone who is using drugs is sufficient grounds for arrest. From the time of arrest, it can take two years before you even appear before a judge.
