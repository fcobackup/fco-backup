Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for Norway on the TravelHealthPro website
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities.
Entry and borders
The travel-restrictions upon entry into Norway have been lifted. The same rules as prior to the COVID-19 pandemic now apply.
All travellers arriving in Svalbard must evidence a negative antigen rapid COVID test result taken within 24 hours before departure to Svalbard and are still required to take a Covid test within 24 hours of arrival. A negative self-test is not valid as documentation. Residents of Svalbard and those who are fully vaccinated or can document they have undergone Covid-19 are exempt from the pre-arrival COVID test.
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Norway.
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will be contacted by the local municipality and placed in isolation. You should let people who have been in close contact with you know. See examples of close contacts and the rules they should follow.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
