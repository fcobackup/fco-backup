This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Latvia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Latvian Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Latvia.
British-Russian dual nationals
People travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport and who hold dual nationality with Russia, may face difficulties and could be refused entry to Latvia.
Passport validity requirements
To travel to Latvia, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
To enter Latvia (and all Schengen countries) your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Checks at border control
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
If you’re a visitor, your passport must be stamped when you enter or leave the Schengen area (which includes Latvia). Border guards will use passport stamps to check you haven’t overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for stays in the Schengen area. If your passport was not stamped, border guards will presume you have overstayed the visa-free limit.
If your passport was not stamped, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
Read about passport stamping if you live in Latvia.
At Latvian border control, you may need to:
show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation or proof of address for a second home
show proof of your travel insurance
show a return or onward ticket
prove that you have enough money for your stay – the amount varies depending on your accommodation
Visa requirements
You can travel without a visa to the Schengen area (including Latvia) for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
If you’re travelling to Latvia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
Applying for a visa
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Latvian government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Latvian Embassy in the UK.
If you stay in Latvia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
If you’re travelling to Latvia for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
Health insurance
You are required to have health insurance when you enter Latvia. This must include repatriation costs. Those who require visas for Latvia (other than EU family members) will need to show their policies on arrival in Latvia.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Latvian guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Latvia. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions for medical reasons, for example certain amounts of powdered infant milk, infant food, or pet food. Check the rules about taking food and drink into the EU on the European Commission website.
Taking money into Latvia
When you enter or leave the EU, you must declare the cash that you are carrying if this amounts to 10,000 euros or more per person. This includes cheques, travellers cheques and money orders.
If you enter Latvia at an internal EU border and you are carrying 10,000 euros or more, the Latvian authorities could ask you to fill in a cash declaration form.
