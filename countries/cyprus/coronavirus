British nationals that wish to leave Cyprus should contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. British nationals in Cyprus should follow the advice of the Cypriot authorities, which includes vacating their tourist accommodation by 21 March.
On 17 March, the Republic of Cyprus announced that a complete ban on flights (except cargo and humanitarian flights) to and from Cyprus would apply from 03:00 (local time) on 21 March until 4 April. The Republic of Cyprus government has instructed all hotel and tourist accommodation to cease operations by 21 March, and to remain closed until 30 April. The government has stated that all tourists will need to leave their accommodation by 21 March. Some hotels may close before 21 March.

Neighbouring countries including Greece and Turkey have also introduced restrictions which may impact on travel. Check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details.
From 15 March, UK nationals (and other non-Cypriots) are not be permitted to enter the Republic of Cyprus for tourism. UK nationals may enter if they are legal residents in the Republic of Cyprus, working in the Republic, attending educational institutions in the Republic or, with prior authorisation, have unavoidable professional obligations.
Essential travel to Cyprus for those in these categories is currently difficult because of the restrictions imposed by the Republic of Cyprus government. The Republic of Cyprus currently requires that all UK travellers to Cyprus have a medical certificate issued in the past four days to show they have tested negative for COVID-19. UK health institutions do not issue negative COVID-19 medical certificates. Without a certificate passengers will be refused entry. Even with the certificate, passengers will have to enter 14 days quarantine in state facilities.
The Republic of Cyprus has stipulated exemptions to medical certificate requirements for:
Individuals who travelled outside Cyprus for medical reasons and those that accompanied them.
Individuals who travelled outside Cyprus on short trips for business or professional obligations.
These individuals will be subject to quarantine on arrival.
Instead of a medical certificates, individuals falling into the above categories will be expected to obtain a certificate from Cyprus’ High Commissions, Consulates or Embassies abroad. These will be issued when the interested party presents documentation on the reason they travelled. We do not have any further detail on the documentation required.
Additionally, anyone arriving from these categories will still be required to stay in quarantine for 14 days, in facilities designated by the Republic of Cyprus, although there may be exemptions for those who travelled for medical reasons. Until further details are published by the government of Cyprus you should clarify your specific circumstances with your local Cypriot High Commission, Consulate or Embassy.
The administration in the north of Cyprus has introduced a total ban on entry for all foreign nationals, including the UK. This includes those holding residency, work, or student permits. In addition, all ‘citizens’ of north Cyprus returning from abroad will be quarantined for 14 days in centres organised by the administration.
Following policy changes announced by the Republic of Cyprus Government and the administration in the north, all crossing points between the Republic and the north are effectively closed to travellers. As part of its coronavirus response, the Cyprus government has banned indoor events of over 75 people and other mass events. If you are due to attend an event, you should check with the event organiser before travelling.
For information from the Cypriot authorities, see the Cypriot Ministry of Health website If you develop fever and/or respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath or cough, the Cyprus Government advise that you stay indoors and immediately contact the Ministry of Health’s public health line: 1420
