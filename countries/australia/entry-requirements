This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Australia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry and departure rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Australia
For full details on entering Australia, please refer to the Australian Government Department of Home Affairs website.
Until 21 February 2022, entry to Australia is only available if you are exempt or have been granted an individual exemption. Exempt categories include Australian citizens, permanent residents of Australia, immediate family members of Australian citizens or permanent residents, and fully vaccinated holders of eligible visas. In some cases an individual exemption may be required. A full explanation of exemptions, including how to apply, can be found on the Department of Home Affairs website.
As of 1 November 2021, ‘immediate family member’ also includes the parents of adult Australian citizens and permanent residents
As of 15 December 2021, fully vaccinated holders of eligible visas are able to enter Australia without obtaining an individual exemption. Details can be found on the Department of Home Affairs website
From 21 February 2022, all fully vaccinated visa holders will be able to travel to Australia without needing to apply for a travel exemption. Unvaccinated visa holders will still need a valid travel exemption to enter Australia.
The latest information can be found on the Department of Home Affairs website – Coming to Australia
To enter Australia you must hold a valid visa. See ‘Visas during COVID-19’ below for more information.
You should check requirements for the state or territory in which you will arrive.
A negative COVID-19 PCR test result is required for travelling to, or transiting through, Australia. Unless you are travelling on a quarantine-free flight from New Zealand, evidence of a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of your scheduled departure must be provided to your airline on check in.
You are also required to complete an Australia Travel Declaration (ATD) at least 72 hours before departure. The ATD includes a declaration regarding your vaccination status and you will be asked to upload your vaccination certificate. If you are not vaccinated, you may require an exemption to enter Australia.
Border rules, including eligibility criteria, can change quickly. Travellers should prepare for disruptions to their plans.
Quarantine requirements
Each state and territory is responsible for determining and managing quarantine requirements. You should check requirements for the state or territory in which you will arrive. If you are a fully vaccinated traveller, you may be eligible for reduced quarantine requirements.
Travellers will need to comply with the quarantine requirements in the state or territory of arrival before travelling on to another state or territory.
Australia has established International Safe Travel Zones with select countries, including New Zealand, enabling some quarantine-free travel from New Zealand to Australia. Eligibility and requirements can change quickly. Full details can be found on the Department of Home Affairs website.
Testing/Screening on arrival
Travellers arriving in Australia may need to undergo enhanced health screening on arrival. This can include temperature testing. You may also be asked to undergo screening or testing in quarantine.
The Australian authorities provide an ‘Information for international travellers fact sheet’ to all travellers on arrival in Australia. This provides information on current requirements
For advice and measures at individual airports, see their websites.
Transiting Australia
The Department of Home Affairs website sets out information on transiting Australia, including on transit visas. There are currently restrictions on transits due to COVID-19.
British nationals are exempt from Australia’s travel restrictions (and do not need to request an exemption) if transiting Australia for 72 hours or less. Evidence of an onward ticket is required.
Due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, you can usually only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight departs from the same airport.
State quarantine requirements remain in place, and airport operating hours vary. This may limit how long you can stay in the airport, and whether you will be subject to the quarantine requirements of the state or territory you have arrived in.
If you have to leave the airport, you may be taken on arrival to a designated quarantine facility. You will need to remain there until returning to the airport for your departing flight. You may need to pay for quarantine - you should check State and Territory websites for details.
British nationals are able to transit through Australia for a maximum of 8 hours without a visa. You must remain airside and you will not be able to clear immigration (including to collect baggage, which should have been checked through to your final destination). If your transit time is longer than 8 hours you will need a visa. See the Department of Home Affairs website for details.
If you plan to transit Australia, check the latest entry restrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel.
Visas during COVID-19
The latest COVID-19 guidance on visa conditions and details on how to apply for a visa is available on the Department of Home Affairs website. The guidance is clear that any visa application will be assessed considering the COVID-19 enhanced border measures and the applicant’s individual circumstances. Applications for new visas should be made before a current visa expires, and if a current visa holder has a “no further stay” condition, a request to waive this condition must be made.
If you’re unable to leave Australia and your visa is nearing expiry or has expired already, you should contact the Australian Department of Home Affairs as soon as possible. Australia does not issue visa extensions so you will need to apply for a new visa to remain lawful in Australia, and provide relevant supporting documentation. The type of visa you can apply for to remain in Australia usually depends on the type of visa you currently hold. For example, those on Visitor visas would be expected to apply for new Visitor visas.
You can find more detail for temporary visa holders, including visitors, students and working holiday makers on the Department of Home Affairs webpage.
Leaving Australia
You should check the Department of Home Affairs website for information on leaving Australia, including whether you need an exemption.
As of 1 November, fully vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents no longer require an exemption to depart Australia.
If you are an Australian citizen or permanent resident, you will need to present an International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate (ICVC). If you were vaccinated outside of Australia and do not have an ICVC, you will need to present a foreign vaccination certificate. For full details please refer to the Department of Home Affairs website.
Australian citizens and permanent residents who are unvaccinated (apart from those under 12 and those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons) must apply for an exemption to depart Australia.
Temporary visa holders do not need an exemption to depart Australia, but may need an exemption to re-enter. As of 15 December, fully vaccinated eligible visa holders will be able to enter Australia without obtaining an exemption, depending on visa type and vaccination status. Details can be found on the Department of Home Affairs website.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Subject to current restrictions, British citizens can usually get the following types of electronic visitor visa:
eVisitor visa direct from the Department of Home Affairs. There is no visa application charge or service fee for this
Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) via your travel agent or airline. There is no visa application charge, but a service fee of A$20 applies
Information on all other types of visa is available from the Department of Home Affairs, or from the Australian High Commission in London.
If you hold an ePassport you can use SmartGate to pass through passport control when arriving in Australia. See the Australian Border Force website for more information.
Working holiday visa
If you’re on a working holiday visa you should be aware of your rights as an employee in Australia and how to report any concerns about unfair or unlawful treatment.
Thousands of British working holiday makers travel to Australia each year with the vast majority enjoying their stay without issue. Working conditions, accommodation and medical facilities are generally of a good standard.
In October 2016 the Fair Work Ombudsman published a report following an inquiry into the wages and conditions of people working under the working holiday visa program, which highlighted exploitative workplace cultures where unreasonable and unlawful requirements were being imposed in some isolated and remote workplaces. If you have concerns about your workplace conditions or treatment you can contact the Fair Work Ombudsman on 13 13 94. You can also report concerns to them anonymously.
If you feel you’re being treated unfairly or unlawfully by an employer, you can email the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) at the British High Commission in Canberra at: Australia.WHVreferrals@fcdo.gov.uk. The NCA is working with a number of Australian authorities to help identify and address any illegal employer behaviour affecting British nationals.
For further information and advice, see our working holiday makers booklet.
Passport validity
For entry into Australia, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is needed.
If you’re transiting another country on your way to or from Australia, make sure you check the entry requirements for that country. Many countries will only permit entry if you have at least 6 months validity remaining on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry into, transit through, and exit from Australia.
Dual nationals
If you’re a British national living in Australia with Australian citizenship, or you’re a dual national, you should leave and enter Australia on your Australian passport, otherwise you may face difficulties and delays. For more information, see the Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade’s website. Please see the Coronavirus page for more information on current restrictions on dual nationals leaving Australia.
