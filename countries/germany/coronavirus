Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Germany. The German authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
If you’re in Germany and wish to leave, you should contact your travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. For information on how to return to the UK from Germany, see Return to the UK
Entry and borders
Germany has intensified border controls at airports and land borders. Unless travellers are resident in Germany, can demonstrate a compelling reason for their travel to Germany, or are border workers commuting between Germany and neighbouring countries, they will be refused entry. If you intend to fly to Germany, check with your airline before you travel and ensure you bring any supporting documentation you need to justify your travel.
The British Embassy understands that British citizens may still be able to enter Germany in order to transit to the UK, but proof of onward travel will be required. You should bear in mind that the situation is changing quickly and that border police in some regions may take a more strict approach.
Germany imposed temporary border checks on its land borders with France, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Denmark on Monday 16 March. Those without a good reason for travelling will not be permitted entry. Frontier workers and goods traffic are not currently affected. German nationals and residents will be allowed to return to Germany. Germany is advising its own citizens against all unnecessary travel abroad.
The German Health Minister has advised that all people in Germany who have been in a risk area in the last 14 days should self-isolate for two weeks, as well as those who have been close contact with a person who has been tested positive for COVID-19. The high risk areas are listed on the Robert Koch Institute website (in German).
Local measures
All regions in Germany are introducing restrictions on people’s movement and on certain activities. Across Germany this includes school closures, closure of public spaces such as nightclubs, museums, cinemas, bookmakers, sports clubs and non-essential shops.
Further restrictions vary by region but include limits on the size of public gatherings, an expansion of the closure of shops and bars, and limiting restaurants to takeaway services only. Visits to hospitals and care homes may also be restricted. As there is some variation between the federal states, you should follow the latest local guidance, much of which is available in English.
Further information
Further advice and information is available from the Federal Health Ministry (in English) and RKI public health agency (in German).
Further advice on coronavirus is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
