Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Uganda
Land borders are open and commercial flights are operating. New COVID-19 standard operating procedures (SOPs) are in place for arriving and departing passengers.
On the 30 April 2021, the Government of Uganda announced that all travellers from the United Kingdom, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, South Sudan, Tanzania, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United States should consider postponing non-essential travel to Uganda. From 8 May 2021 all travellers from these countries will be required to undergo PCR testing at the border at their own expense, including at Entebbe International Airport, unless they have received their full COVID-19 vaccination and show no COVID-19 symptoms. The cost of the PCR test will be up $65. Travellers from the above countries will be taken from the airport to a nearby testing site. Test results will take up to 4 hours. Travellers have the option of waiting at the testing site for their results or checking into a designated hotel at their own expense. Anyone who tests positive (including children) will be taken to a Ministry of Health designated COVID-19 isolation facility. As of 2 May 2021, passengers who have been in India in the previous 14 days will not be permitted entry into Uganda.
Passengers arriving or departing from Entebbe International Airport can only be picked up or dropped off by a maximum of two people, including the driver, in order to avoid crowding. Vehicles with more than the authorised number of people will not be allowed access to the airport.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. Some airlines have refused to allow passengers who have used NHS tests to travel. You should arrange to take a private test.
Testing/Screening on arrival
Arriving passengers will be subject to temperature checks and will be screened for infectious diseases by the Port Health authorities. If a passengers shows signs or symptoms of any infectious disease they will taken by ambulance to a local isolation centre to undergo a COVID-19 test at their own cost. Test results will be returned within 24 to 48 hours; passengers will be expected to remain at the isolation centre until the test results are returned.
If a foreign national tests positive for COVID-19 and wishes to be repatriated for treatment outside of Uganda, they will be expected to cover the costs themselves.
Testing / screening on departure
Departing passengers are required to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate, issued no more than 120 hours before travel. The 120 hours begins on the day the sample is collected for testing.
COVID-19 tests taken for the purpose of travel outside of Uganda have to be paid for, even if the test is taken at a government testing centre. From 23 November 2020, all COVID-19 test certificates issued in Uganda must indicate the intended purpose of the test. Only test certificates which state travel as the intended purpose will be valid for departure from Uganda. Test certificates which state contact or alert will not be valid for travel.
There are a number of public and private COVID-19 test centres in Uganda. For further information, please see the government COVID-19 Response website.
Departing passengers will be required to wear a face mask inside the terminal and will be subject to temperature checks. Social distancing will also be in place and only passengers with valid tickets and airport officials will be allowed into the terminal building. Passengers are advised to arrive at the airport at least 4 hours before departure.
Passengers travelling on flights departing during curfew hours (9pm to 6am) will be allowed to travel to the airport upon presentation of a valid ticket.
