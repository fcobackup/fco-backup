Many parts of Turkey are subject to earthquakes and tremors.
A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit Elazig and neighbouring provinces in the east of Turkey on 24 January 2020, causing damage to local buildings and a number of fatalities. A number of aftershocks were also reported. You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake and follow any advice given by the local authorities.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has information about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
