Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Taiwan
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Taiwan, attacks cannot be ruled out.
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID 
Always carry ID such as a passport. The police will usually accept a printed copy of the photo page.
Illegal drugs and penalties
Avoid any involvement with illegal drugs, including cannabis, while in Taiwan. Drug laws are stricter than in the UK. Legal definitions of supply or trafficking may be different from in the UK, including the quantities of drugs involved. If you’re found guilty of smuggling, trafficking, possession or use of illegal narcotics, you can expect to get a severe prison sentence or, in some cases, the death penalty.
LGBT+ travellers
Taiwan has some of Asia’s most progressive policies on LGBT+ rights, and discrimination on the grounds of gender and gender identity is illegal. Taiwan’s Pride parade, held annually in October, is the largest regular LGBT+ event in Asia, attracting high numbers of participants from the region and internationally.

Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Taiwan, see information on driving abroad.
You need a 1949 international driving permit (IDP) as well as a UK driving licence to drive in Taiwan. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Once in Taiwan, you will need to take your passport, IDP and a passport photograph to a local Motor Vehicles Office to get your IDP validated. Your validated IDP will last up to 12 months.
If you stay longer, you will need to get a new IDP and get it validated. Or you can exchange your UK driving licence for a Taiwan driving licence at a Motor Vehicles Office. The British Office in Taipei cannot provide support on individual applications.
If you do not want to exchange your UK driving licence, you can take a local driving test to get a Taiwan driving licence.
Driving standards and road rules
Roads and vehicles are well-maintained, but scooters and motorcycles often weave in and out of traffic. Be alert when crossing roads as vehicles might not stop at pedestrian crossings.
The alcohol limit for drivers in Taiwan is about a quarter of that in England. If you drive while over the limit, you may get a heavy fine and possible imprisonment. If you are a passenger, you may also be fined.
Extreme weather and natural disasters 
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
If there is a typhoon or an earthquake, check the Taiwanese authorities’ websites for public announcements and details of which roads, schools and office buildings have been closed:
Directorate-General of Personnel Administration
Directorate General of Highways
Typhoons
The typhoon season in Taiwan normally runs from May to November. There’s a risk of road blockages and landslides after typhoons, especially in central and southern Taiwan.
Listen to typhoon alerts on the ICRT, BCC and PRS radio stations, and monitor the websites of the Central Weather Administration and the Japan Meteorological Agency.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a risk in Taiwan. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has guidance about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
Taipei City Government have created an online digital booklet with useful information on how to keep safe during an earthquake, typhoon and other types of natural and man-made disasters.
