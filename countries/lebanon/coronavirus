Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) is responsible for COVID-19 testing at the airport and will inform you by text if you tested positive on arrival. If you test positive you will be expected to self-isolate in your accommodation. The MOPH or hospital where you got tested will pass on your details to the local authorities, and you may get contacted by the local municipality and offered support, but this is not guaranteed. We would not expect unaccompanied minors to be treated any differently from others.
Measures within Lebanon
COVID-19 measures can change at short notice. Contact the Lebanese embassy for more information if you are not sure about COVID-19 measures in Lebanon.
Shops may require you to wear masks and tourist and entertainment venues may also require you to show proof of a negative PCR result or vaccination. Fabric masks covering the mouth and nose must be worn when in vehicles (unless travelling alone).
Lebanese authorities may issue fines, impose road blocks, or imprison those violating these measures for up to three years. You should comply with all measures introduced by the Lebanese authorities and obey the instructions of the security forces. These measures may be changed at short notice.
You are advised to phone ahead to check any restrictions. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Accommodation
Hotels and private rentals are available. You should check that accommodation is open and receiving guests before booking, and request information on the measures being taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and on their fuel situation. Many businesses have closed due to the economic crisis.
