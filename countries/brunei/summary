From 4 July, Brunei is exempt from the FCO advice against all non-essential international travel. This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
However, the requirement to self-isolate on return to the UK from Brunei remains in place. See guidance on entering or returning to the UK.
Travel to Brunei is subject to entry restrictions
Entry to Brunei is severely restricted. It is not yet clear which exceptional circumstances, if any, foreign nationals may be permitted to enter Brunei.
If the Government of Brunei permits you entry, you will be required to go into quarantine on arrival at a government booked facility (usually a local hotel).
All foreigners will have to pay $1,000 BND for a COVID-19 test upon arrival, and will need to cover the cost of their stay in a quarantine facility (14 days from the date of arrival).
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
