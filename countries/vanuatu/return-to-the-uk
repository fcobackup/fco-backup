Due to the rapidly changing nature of the COVID-19 outbreak across the region, flight availability and entry requirements/prohibitions can change at short notice.
This means your ability to leave Vanuatu by commercial airlines, or your ability to fly to your chosen destination could be curtailed at short notice. Our ability to provide consular services or support any evacuation in the Pacific may also be limited by these factors. You should take these limitations and risks into account when making travel plans.
If you are visiting Vanuatu, you are advised to leave as soon as possible.
