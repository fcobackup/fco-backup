The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Mongolia based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
If you are returning to the UK from Mongolia on or after 4am on 28 November, you do not need to self-isolate on your return. Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Travel to Mongolia is subject to entry restrictions
It is currently not possible for British nationals to enter Mongolia due to restrictions imposed by the Mongolian government except in limited circumstances.
Entry to Mongolia for British nationals who hold a valid long-stay visa (e.g. work permit), permanent residency or business visa for Mongolia may be possible. Quarantine requirements still apply.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
Check our advice on foreign travel during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and sign up for email alerts for this travel advice.
If you’re planning travel to Mongolia, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
All scheduled commercial flights have been cancelled. Charter flights to and from Mongolia have been suspended indefinitely. See Return to the UK
Around 6,500 British nationals visit Mongolia annually. Most visits are trouble-free.
Mongolia takes border security very seriously and foreign nationals aren’t routinely permitted access to border areas. The authorities can regard zones of up to 100km inside the border as a border area. If you wish to travel in these areas, you must get permission from the State Frontier Guard Authority. Only a few specified land border crossings are open to foreigners. See Border crossings
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Mongolia, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism.
Avoid going out on foot alone at night. Foreigners stand out and can be targeted for attack because of their comparative wealth. See Crime.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
