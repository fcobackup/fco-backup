Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Moldova. The Moldovan authorities have declared a state of emergency and introduced a number of measures intended to limit the spread of the virus.
Travel restrictions
Foreigners who do not hold Moldovan residency are currently not permitted to enter Moldova. Since 17 March all scheduled international passenger flights to and from Chisinau International Airport have been suspended. Most border crossings to Romania have been closed (for details, check the Moldovan government website). The crossings remaining open include Ungheni and Leuseni which give access to Iasi (Romania) which has an international airport with scheduled flights to UK. The Romanian government introduced restrictions on entry to Romania on 22 March. UK passport holders can enter Romania if they are in transit or have residency in that country. For full details on restrictions when crossing the border to Romania, you should refer to our Travel Advice for Romania. You should contact your travel operator and air carrier for more information before travelling to Moldova.
