Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Seychelles to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Seychelles
The Seychellois authorities introduced a lockdown from 9 April. From 4 May, restrictions on movement in Seychelles have eased, but some restrictions remain in place until further notice.
Restaurants and shops are allowed to open again, but shops must close at 8pm. Bars and clubs are to remain closed until further notice. People may return to work, but the prohibition of public assemblies and public events continues. People are also prohibited from gathering in groups of more than 4 until further notice. Parties and beach gatherings are not allowed. House parties, which include any person from outside the immediate household, are prohibited.
Restrictions are enforceable by law and can change at short notice. You should consult the Department of Health in Seychelles for further information and monitor local media for the latest developments.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions. If country is accepting subsistence loan, add:
If you’re in Seychelles, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
