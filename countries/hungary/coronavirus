Travel restrictions
Hungary has restricted entry to foreign nationals.
Hungarian citizens and EEA citizens (including UK nationals) holding a Permanent Residence Card or a Registration Certificate and Address Card are allowed to enter the country following a medical examination at the border to check for signs of Covid-19 infection. Those individuals suspected of infection will be put into officially designated quarantine for 14 days. If there is no suspicion of infection, individuals will still be required to quarantine at home for 14 days.
From 4 May, citizens of the Czech Republic, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Germany, Austria and Slovakia may also enter Hungary from these countries for business purposes. This measure also allows Hungarian citizens to travel to and from these countries for business trips, provided that they are an employee of a domestic firm or company registered in one of these six countries and that the firm or company has business ties with another company registered in one of these six countries. Individuals who fall under this category of business travellers may enter Hungary without any restriction or requirement for self-isolation.
The situation may change rapidly, including in neighbouring countries, where some airports have closed or ceased direct flights to the UK.

Local measures
Hungary has introduced rules to manage people’s social interaction with those outside their household. The police have powers to fine people breaking the rules.
Some rules apply nationwide, some rules apply in Budapest and Pest County only and, from 4 May, some rules apply everywhere except Budapest and Pest County.
Nationwide rules
Nationwide, people should keep social contact to a minimum and maintain a 1.5m distance from others if possible. Between 9am and 12pm each day, only people over 65 are permitted to enter food shops, drug stores, and pharmacies. Schools remain closed until at least the end of May. Mass events are banned until at least 15 August.
Local authorities have some powers to introduce additional restrictions, so monitor local media and follow local instructions.
Rules in Budapest and Pest County only
In Budapest and Pest County, stricter rules remain in force. In these areas, people should stay at home as much as possible. The rules allow individuals to leave home only for essential purposes, for example work, shopping for essential products, banking and postal services, and to help people unable to provide for themselves. All restaurants should offer takeaway services only.
Outdoor exercise is permitted, but people must either be alone or only with people from their household. Otherwise, they must maintain a minimum 1.5m distance from others.
From 27 April, people in Budapest should wear a face covering (ie mask, scarf or shawl) in all shops, markets and when using taxis or public transport.
Rules in the rest of the country (outside Budapest and Pest County) – from 4 May
In all other parts of Hungary (except Budapest and Pest County), the nationwide measures noted above continue to apply. From 4 May, in areas other than Budapest and Pest County, the government has eased some restrictions. Shops can open without restriction, while maintaining the 9am to 12pm shopping time for over-65s. People may visit service providers. Cafes, restaurants and bars may re-open, but guests are only allowed to sit outside. People may visit outdoor swimming pools and spas, zoos and outdoor museums. In all settings, the manager should provide conditions for customers to maintain a 1.5m distance from others.
From 4 May, people should wear a face covering (ie mask, scarf or shawl) in shops and when using taxis or public transport in the whole of Hungary.
Higher education institutions outside Budapest and Pest County are allowed to reopen with measures to promote social distancing.
Religious ceremonies, civil marriages and funerals can be held with social distancing measures in place.
The full details are set out on the Hungarian government website
UK nationals living in Hungary should note that the National Directorate General for Aliens Policing has introduced changes in in-person appointments to help reduce the spread of the virus. Expiring resident permits from 11 March onwards will automatically remain valid during the state of emergency and for 45 days after the state of emergency terminates. If you are a UK national residing in Hungary for over three months, and trying to register your stay, you should visit the webpage of the National Directorate General for Aliens Policing for guidance on how to do this.
