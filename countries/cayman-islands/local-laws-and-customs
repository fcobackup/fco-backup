The Cayman Islands is a separate legal jurisdiction to the United Kingdom and has its own laws.
There are harsh penalties for those caught with drugs of any kind. A number of British nationals have been arrested in the past, attempting to smuggle marijuana on British Airways flights to London. As a consequence, these flights are still being closely monitored by the local customs authorities.
Observe customs regulations on the import and export of agricultural products and the protection of marine and animal life. There are a number of marine and animal specimens that may not be taken from the islands. If in doubt, check with the customs office before buying, or attempting to import or export such items.
There’s no provision for marriage or civil partnership ceremonies between same sex couples. Same-sex partnerships, legally binding or otherwise, aren’t recognised in Cayman law. Hotels and resorts are generally welcoming, regardless of sexual orientation. Local attitudes can be conservative and some people may not approve of public displays of affection between same-sex couples. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
