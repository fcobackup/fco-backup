Drug taking and smuggling is an offence. Punishments can be severe.
It’s illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence. Namibia is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which bans trade in ivory and rhino horn. Anyone caught buying or trafficking these goods will be prosecuted and could receive a prison sentence or fine.
Homosexuality is not illegal in Namibia. Some sexual relations between men are criminalised, but this is generally not enforced. However, many people in Namibia consider LGBT relationships to be taboo. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
There are no formal rules limiting photography by tourists in Namibia, but some people have been detained for taking pictures of State House and properties where the President is residing. Parts of Namibia require a permit to enter (eg the Cape Cross Seal Colony) and you should check about photography when applying for permits. If the army or police are protecting a building or place, check before taking any photographs. If in doubt, don’t take pictures.
