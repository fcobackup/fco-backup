Private COVID-19 tests are carried out in laboratories approved by the Ministry of Health.
Most private labs offer testing at home or at hotels; the tests are easy to arrange at an extra fee. Quito and Guayaquil international airports also have private labs in place for COVID-19 tests.

It can provide general reports, official announcements and information to evaluate potential COVID-19 symptoms. It also allows online medical checks and scheduling appointments at Ministry of Public Health centres for non-coronavirus needs.
