The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
Vietnam has announced that from noon Vietnam time (0500 UK) on 15 March 2020 foreign nationals will be refused entry to Vietnam if in the previous 14 days they have been to the UK, or any Schengen country, even in transit. This restriction will be in place for 30 days.
British nationals already in Vietnam by that time will not need to leave the country.
For flights from the UK to Vietnam up until noon Vietnam time on 15 March 2020 there is a very high risk of disruption, restrictions and quarantine on arrival for British nationals.
British nationals arriving in Vietnam with a visa who have not been in the UK or an EU country in the Schengen travel area in the past 14 days face the risk of self-isolation or quarantine if anyone on their flight or ship test positive for coronavirus or is suspected of having coronavirus. The standard of quarantine facilities vary greatly and is significantly below standards in the UK.
Whilst it may be possible for British citizens with essential business to enter Vietnam with a valid visa and who have not been to the UK or any of the Schengen countries in the previous 14 days we strongly advise you to check in advance with a Vietnamese embassy.
The visa waiver programme for British nationals has been suspended, most e-visa applications are not being processed and there is there is uncertainty around the replacement process and timeline for such applications. Anyone with essential business in Vietnam planning to travel is advised to get a visa before booking flights.
British citizens arriving in Vietnam who have not been in the UK or a Schengen country in the past 14 days will be required to fill in a health questionnaire and undertake basic health tests on arrival. False declarations regarding health history could lead to prosecution.
If you have questions about entry requirements for your specific itinerary, you should contact the Vietnamese Embassy in London or, if already in Vietnam, the nearest Immigration Office.
From November 2015, British nationals who are spouses or children of Vietnamese nationals can apply for a visa exemption certificate. The certificate is valid for 5 years and allows multiple entries into Vietnam for 6 month periods. Applications can be made at the nearest Vietnamese Embassy or the Immigration Department in Vietnam.
Overstaying your Vietnamese visa without authority is a serious matter and you may be delayed from travel until a fine is paid. Check the visa validity and conditions carefully.
For further information about visa requirements, check with the Vietnamese Embassy in London.
Land borders
There are a number of local crossing points on the borders with Cambodia and Laos which are for nationals of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam only and so don’t allow British nationals to cross. Check locally before travelling to these points.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum of 6 months on the date you enter Vietnam for you to be eligible for the 15 day visa exemption.
For periods of stay longer than 15 days, entry into Vietnam may be refused if your passport has less than 1 month validity from the date your Vietnamese visa expires.
A number of British nationals have been refused entry and exit due to their passport being damaged. Make sure your passport is in good condition before arriving in Vietnam. Being refused entry can result in significant cost and a long stay at the airport.
Registration
When checking into a hotel, you’ll have to hand over your passport so that the hotel can register your presence with the local police. Make sure your passport is returned and keep it in a safe place. Don’t use your passport as a deposit for renting a hotel room. If you are staying in private accommodation, you will still be expected to register. Ask your host to help you with this as soon as you arrive. You may be fined if you don’t register.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Vietnam. Please contact the nearest Vietnamese Embassy to obtain an appropriate visa before travel. If your ETD has been issued in Vietnam, to replace a lost/stolen passport, you will need an exit visa from the Vietnam Immigration Department before you can travel out of Vietnam. This process normally takes 5 working days. Contact the Immigration Department directly for further information.
