There is no British Embassy in Burkina Faso and our ability to provide consular assistance is severely limited. If you’re in Burkina Faso and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the British Embassy in Accra [https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-accra] or contact the FCDO in the UK on +44 1908 516666. You can speak to a consular officer 24/7 on this number – select consular services and then the emergencies option. For less urgent enquiries you can make contact using this form.
Mobile phone networks can be unreliable especially outside towns and cities.
Political Situation
A transitional government assumed control in Burkina Faso following the coup d’état on 30 September 2022. The political situation remains unstable, and further coups are possible.
Public demonstrations including anti-government protests are common in Burkina Faso. You should avoid all political rallies and gatherings, demonstrations and protests. Crowds can gather quickly and may become violent. Foreign, national and local government facilities have been targeted and damaged in previous demonstrations. You should monitor the local news to help you avoid such gatherings. If you become aware of a crowd gathering where you are, you should leave the area immediately.
Crime
There is a risk of armed groups stopping vehicles (including public buses) on major roads to rob them, particularly at night.
Street crime poses high risks for visitors. Most incidents involve opportunist snatches of purses, wallets, jewellery and other valuables. Thieves are particularly active in crowded places. The areas near and around the UN Circle and the former Central Market in Ouagadougou experience a high amount of street crime. You should take sensible precautions. Do not carry valuables in public places or walk alone at night.
Scams
British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms such as romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities, and can pose great financial risk to victims.
You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face-to-face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.
Local travel
If you decide to travel outside of Ouagadougou against FCDO advice, you should take professional security advice and avoid travel between towns by road at night, particularly from Bobo Dioulasso to Côte d’Ivoire, and Fada to Benin and Togo. There is a history of violent incidents in these areas.
Incidents are not confined to principal routes. Secondary roads (notably roads in the east to Benin, Bogandée and Gayeri) have also been affected.
You should also take care if you’re travelling by road between Burkina Faso and Niger. Travel in convoy where possible and seek local advice before setting out. Following the military takeover in neighbouring Niger in July 2023, there is a heightened risk of increased instability in Burkina Faso.
Armed roadside banditry is a problem across the country, and the number of attacks has increased in recent years. Drivers who have refused to stop for robbers have been shot at. Remote and border regions are particularly vulnerable but there have been attacks on the main road between Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.
Road travel
You can drive in Burkina Faso using a UK driving licence.
With a few exceptions, roads are poor with few streetlights. There is a risk of banditry and hitting stray livestock. Road conditions off the main roads are often difficult, especially in the rainy season (June-September). Vehicles do not always have headlights and are often in poor condition. There is a history of violent incidents along roads in areas outside Ouagadougou.
Stay on clearly marked roads or tracks and avoid minor roads in remote areas unless travelling in convoy. If you break down off a main road you may not be able to attract help. Carry drinking water with you.
