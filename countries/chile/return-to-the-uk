If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Chile, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means.
Commercial travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Chilean authorities and other governments to make sure further options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
There are currently listed commercial options to return to the UK from Chile, via the US, Brazil and Spain.
LATAM Airline flights from Santiago to Miami restarted on 1 May, and are currently running 5 times a week. The large majority of scheduled LATAM flights from Santiago to Miami since 1 May have flown, but some have been cancelled at short-notice. All flights could be subject to last minute change or cancellation. You should contact the airline prior to booking.
LATAM flights from Santiago to Sao Paulo commenced on 27 May.
Iberia Airlines have intermittent flights from Santiago to Madrid listed from 22 June onwards.
Onward connections to the UK from Miami, Sao Paulo and Madrid are available.
On 26 May LATAM filed for bankruptcy protection, but has stated that they intend to keep flying passengers. The British Embassy Santiago has been advised that the Santiago to Miami and Sao Paolo routes will continue operating.
LATAM require all passengers to have filled-in a “Pasaporte Sanitario” to be allowed to board their flights. This government form, requests information on recent countries visited and coronavirus-related health. Once filled-in and submitted, you will receive a PDF of the completed form that you can store on your phone or print.
Financial support for flight
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
If you are travelling to the airport to catch a flight from one of the areas under quarantine or curfew, presenting your passport and boarding pass will permit you to cross any checkpoints. Use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions. Chilean authorities require the use of masks in all public spaces/public transport, including the airport.
Visas
If you plan to fly back to the UK make sure you have not overstayed on your visa – this could affect your departure. If you have any concerns about visa renewal, contact us at uk.inchile@fco.gov.uk
