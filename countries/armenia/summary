The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advise against all travel:
within 5km of the full eastern border between Armenia and Azerbaijan
along the M16/H26 road between the towns of Ijevan and Noyemberyan
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the remainder of Armenia based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks
Travel to Armenia is subject to entry restrictions
You can now enter Armenia with a negative PCR test certificate issued a maximum of 72 hours prior to arrival.
If you arrive without a certificate, and have no symptoms, you can pay for a PCR test at Zvartnots International airport. You must then isolate until you receive a negative result.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

Armenia declared a nationwide state of emergency on 27 September following widespread military activity along the Line of Contact in Nagorno-Karabakh. Among other restrictions, this prohibits mass gatherings, introduces curbs on the spread of information about the situation from unofficial sources, and provides extra powers for police and other civil authorities to enforce public safety and order. Protests sometimes take place in central Yerevan and other major cities. These are usually organised by opposition political parties or activist groups highlighting topical social and political issues. Although protests tend to be peaceful and usually pass off without incident, you should avoid large crowds and demonstrations, follow the advice and instructions of the local authorities, monitor the media and remain vigilant.
The border between Armenia and Azerbaijan is closed. There have been several instances of military clashes across the border, including in July 2020, resulting in a number of deaths and casualties. We advise against all travel within 5km of the border. See Safety and security and FCDO travel advice for Azerbaijan.
Take extra care near military emplacements and in villages and connecting roads between the main M16/H26 artery and the border to its east. See Local travel
Consular support is not available in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. See Political situation
Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Armenia, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
The border between Armenia and Georgia is currently closed to passenger traffic due to COVID-19 restrictions. See Local travel
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
