If you’re transiting through Trinidad and Tobago
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Travellers transiting through Trinidad and Tobago on their way to another country and who are staying in the airport (airside) are not subject to any vaccination requirement.
However, if you need to pass through immigration, for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day (sometimes known as a layover) or in order to board a connecting flight at a different airport Terminal, you will need to follow T&T’s general vaccination requirements. Effective 1 July 2022, travellers entering Trinidad and Tobago no longer have to produce a negative RT-PCR Test or an Antigen Test as a requirement for entry.
Sailing travel restrictions
You can sail into and transit out of the marinas or Chaguaramas Bay. Effective 17 July 2022 you are no longer required to wear a mask. Failure to follow government regulations could result in being intercepted by the Coast Guard and being handed over to the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service.
