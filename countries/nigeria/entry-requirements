The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You should get a valid visa before travelling.
Some business travellers might be eligible to apply for a visa on arrival. Applications for a visa on arrival must be made in advance and applicants must obtain a pre-approval letter from the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) before travelling. Guidance on applying for a visa on arrival is available on the NIS website.
If you have a valid Nigerian residence permit (CERPAC or Green Card) you don’t need a visa to enter Nigeria.
For further information on entry requirements, contact the Nigeria High Commission in London.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Nigeria.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Nigeria providing they are endorsed with the appropriate visa.
