FCDO advises against all travel to Yemen.

Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). 
FCDO advises against all travel to Yemen 
FCDO advises against all travel to the whole of the Yemen due to the unpredictable security conditions.
If you’re in Yemen, you should leave immediately.  
See Safety and security for more information. 
UK government support 
Support for British people is severely limited in Yemen. British Embassy services in Sana’a are suspended, and all diplomatic and consular staff have been withdrawn. 
The UK government cannot help British nationals leaving Yemen. There are no evacuation procedures in place. 
FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of travelling to any potential departure point. The UK government’s ability to help with onward travel is severely limited and you’ll be expected to cover the cost of visas, accommodation, insurance and onward travel yourself. 
If you choose to remain in Yemen, you should minimise movement around the country and within cities and towns, monitor developments in the local security situation and follow other precautions in this travel advice. 
If you’re a British national in Yemen and need help from the UK government, you can call FCDO on 020 7008 5000 (24 hours). 
Travel insurance 
If you choose to travel against FCDO advice, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
