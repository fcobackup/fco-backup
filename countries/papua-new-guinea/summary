Papua New Guinea has confirmed its first case of coronavirus (COVID-19). The situation may change rapidly, including in neighbouring countries. Follow local guidance at all times. The Papua New Guinea authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As of 23 March, for seven days, no person may enter PNG except for health workers, diplomats with special authorisation, flight crew or military personnel. Visitors from the UK or European Union must self-quarantine for 14 days before being allowed entry to Papua New Guinea. See Health
The Government of Australia has announced that from 9pm Australia Eastern Standard Time on 20 March, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March. As many flight connections to and from Papua New Guinea connect in Australia and New Zealand, options to depart Papua New Guinea are likely to reduce. If you’re currently a visitor in Papua New Guinea, you’re advised to prepare to leave as soon as possible. If you’re resident in Papua New Guinea, you should be aware of the potential impact of the border closures and flight restrictions on future travel plans.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Hela and Southern Highlands provinces following significantly increased levels of tribal fighting and the declaration of states of emergency by the Papua New Guinea government.
There has also been heavier than usual tribal fighting in Enga and Western Highlands provinces. If you’re planning to travel to these provinces, you should take greater care than usual and consider enhanced security precautions.
Outbreaks of tribal violence may occur with little warning and may escalate very quickly. You should avoid large crowds and public gatherings as they may turn violent. See Crime
