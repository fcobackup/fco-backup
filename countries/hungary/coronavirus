Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Hungary. The Hungarian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Travel restrictions
The restrictions will remain in effect indefinitely, until revoked. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
The Hungarian Prime Minister announced on 16 March that Hungary would close all borders to foreigners at midnight on Monday 16 March. Only Hungarian citizens and EEA citizens (including UK nationals) holding a Permanent Residence Card or a Registration Certificate and Address Card will be allowed to enter the country.
Further restrictions to daily life may be announced over the coming days and we are monitoring the situation. The situation may change rapidly, including in neighbouring countries, where some airports have closed or ceased direct flights to the UK.

Hungary has restricted opening hours of restaurants, cafes and some shops, which must close by 3pm. It has also closed all universities and schools. Many attractions like spas and zoos are also closed. Public transport remains open.
