Airport closure to international flights
In response to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Government of Guyana, announced the cancellation of all international flights from the Cheddi Jagan International Airport at Timehri and the Eugene Correia Airport at Ogle. The closure started on 17 March 2020 and is scheduled to last for the foreseeable future. Some repatriation charter flights are being allowed to leave Guyana.
Since many countries in the region have closed their borders, only Barbados has had direct flights to the United Kingdom. The High Commission have previously managed to secure charter flights to connect with them, however these direct flights to the UK from Barbados have now stopped. There will therefore be no further charter flights to Barbados until further notice. If you are a British National in Guyana or Suriname and wish to leave, you should contact the British High Commission by email returnfrom.guyana@fco.gov.uk, who will inform you as soon as departure options become available.
Borders
The Governments of Brazil and Suriname have both announced the closure of borders with neighbouring countries, including Guyana. There is no exit/entry available to Venezuela. Guidance for travellers coming to Guyana from a COVID-19 affected country is available from the Guyana Ministry of Public Health. The Guyana government hotline is +592 624 3067 and +592 227 4986 ext 215.
Local Measures
The Chief Medical Officer from the Guyana Ministry of Public Health has urged people to exercise social distancing and carry out measures to reduce the spread of the virus. There are however no official restrictions in place at the moment.
Further information
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
