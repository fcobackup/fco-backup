The Czech authorities have put in place a series of measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
On 12 March, the Czech government declared a 30-day State of Emergency in response. Measures include:
Restrictions on entry
Only those holding Czech residency are permitted to enter the country. Anyone who enters the Czech Republic from a high-risk country (which includes the UK) will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. The list of high risk countries is available from the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Foreign nationals, including UK citizens, are permitted to leave the country, but may not be able to re-enter the Czech Republic. Czech nationals are not permitted to leave the country unless they can prove residency elsewhere. Exemptions exist and more details can be found on the website of the Czech Ministry of the Interior (link below). Czech residency cards are needed to prove residency when boarding flights or crossing a land border into the Czech Republic. If you do not have your residency card, you can demonstrate residency through a letter from your employer, a rental contract or proof of a Czech bank account.
Transit through the Czech Republic
UK nationals can transit the Czech Republic without Czech residency if they can demonstrate their purpose is to travel straight back to the UK. They must provide evidence of onward travel and a signed declaration of honour, and meet the requirements set out below to cover their mouth and nose. Further information, including the declaration form, are available on the Ministry of Interior’s website. We advise all UK nationals to contact their travel provider before making any journey to confirm their journey can go ahead.
Restrictions on freedom of movement and social distancing measures
From 16 March to 24 March, all residents in the Czech Republic are permitted to leave their homes only when absolutely necessary, for example to travel to and from work, to buy groceries, to visit a doctor or close relative, or to make other essential journeys.
From 18 March, anyone leaving their homes must have their mouth and nose covered. This should be done using a face mask if available, although scarves are allowed if a face mask cannot be obtained.
From Saturday 14 March, all shops are now closed for 10 days, with the exception of supermarkets, pharmacies, opticians, newsagents, shops selling electronics, petrol stations and e-shops with home delivery. Restaurants, bars and pubs are closed, but can sell food to take away.
From 10 March, schools and universities have been ordered to close. Kindergartens remain open in some areas. UK nationals in need of specific information on education are advised to contact their local Czech authorities.
Transport restrictions
From Saturday 14 March, emergency measures restricting international transport entered into effect. The Czech Government Office website (in English) has further information.
International air travel is now limited to Prague airport, which remains open, but flights are being cancelled. If you’re currently in the Czech Republic and want to leave the country, you should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible to ensure departure. Please check with your carrier before travelling to Prague airport to see if your flight is affected.
From Saturday 14 March, cross-border bus, train and ferry services are suspended. From Monday 16 March, Czech nationals will be prevented from leaving the country by car. UK and other foreign nationals will still be allowed to travel out of the Czech Republic by car after that time but will not be allowed to re-enter.
Road travel into Germany, Poland and Austria is currently restricted to 11 designated border crossings. Countries neighbouring the Czech Republic, including Slovakia, Germany, Austria and Poland, are also affected by restrictions. Please check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details.
The government has confirmed that foreign tourists already in the Czech Republic will be able to return home.
