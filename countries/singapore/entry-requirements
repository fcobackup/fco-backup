This page has information on travelling to Singapore. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Singapore set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Only Singapore citizens and Long-Term Pass Holder (excluding Work Permit holders) can enter Singapore without prior approval.
If you’re not a citizen or a Long-Term Pass Holder, you must get approval to enter Singapore.
In general, British citizens do not need a visa to transit or enter Singapore. It’s up to Immigration and Checkpoints Authority to decide who can enter Singapore.
There are other measures in place for foreign crew working on ships, small vessels, or pleasure crafts at one of Singapore’s marinas. See guidelines for air/sea crew and pleasure craft owners. Check with your employer or agent for any specific COVID-19 rules at the marina.
Singapore has strict rules on:
wearing masks outside of home
gathering in groups
being fully vaccinated to enter public buildings, eat out and join some activities
scanning in and out of public venues with the TraceTogether app/token
testing, self-isolation and quarantine, whenever these are required
Breaking these rules can lead to a lengthy investigation, fines, or a prison sentence. See Coronavirus section.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Entering on a Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL)
If you’re fully vaccinated, you can apply to enter Singapore under a Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) without needing to quarantine. You must:
have spent the past 7 days in a VTL country
apply for a vaccinated travel pass 3 to 60 days before your departure date
book seats on a designated VTL flight
have travel insurance with COVID-19 coverage (minimum S$30,000)
have digital or physical copies of the required documents
take the required COVID-19 tests before departure and on arrival
Children aged 12 years and under who are unvaccinated but travelling with fully-vaccinated parents or guardians can enter Singapore on a Vaccinated Travel Lane. This includes children turning 12 years old in 2022.
If you’re fully vaccinated and you’ve recovered from COVID-19 in the past three months, you may be exempt from taking COVID-19 tests.
See the VTL Overview on the Safe Travel website for complete information.
Entering Singapore: other channels
If you’re not travelling on VTL flights, requirements vary depending on your vaccination status, where you spent the last 14 days, and your purpose of travel. Use the self-help tool on the Safe Travel website for more information.
What happens if you test positive for COVID-19
You’ll need to self-isolate at the hotel or home you’re staying in. What happens next will depend on whether you’re well or unwell. See Ask MOH. Breaking self-isolation or quarantine orders is an offence. See Coronavirus section.
Proof of vaccination status
You must show proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Singapore.
Singapore will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
The digital vaccination certificates issued by certain countries are accepted.
If you’re on a short-term pass in Singapore, you’ll have to download the TraceTogether app or buy a TraceTogether token to scan in and out of public venues.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
You cannot enter Singapore unless:
you’re a Singapore citizen or a permanent resident
you have approval to enter under the Familial Ties Lane
If you plan to visit Singapore for compassionate reasons, see the guidelines for the Death and Critical Illness Emergency Visit Lane.
Children and young people
Children aged 13 and above in 2022 (including 12-year-olds turning 13 this year) must be fully vaccinated to travel on a Vaccinated Travel Lane. Those who have had only one dose cannot enter Singapore unless they:
have immediate family who are Singapore citizens or permanent residents – they can apply to enter under the Familial Ties Lane
are travelling with one parent or guardian for compassionate reasons – they can apply to enter under the Death and Critical Illness Emergency Visits Lane
Children aged 12 years and under who are unvaccinated but travelling with fully-vaccinated parents or guardians can enter Singapore on the Vaccinated Travel Lane. This includes children turning 12 years old in 2022.
Children aged 3 and above (including those turning 3 in 2022) are subject to pre-departure test and arrival test requirements in Singapore.
See Singapore’s Safe Travel website for full guidelines.
If you’re transiting through Singapore
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Check with your airline if it has approval to transit through Singapore.
All passengers transiting Changi Airport for less than 24 hours are not required to have proof of a pre-departure test.
If you recently recovered from COVID-19, different rules apply depending on your vaccination status.
You do not need a visa for an airside transit in Singapore.
More information about transiting through Singapore can be found on the Transiting through Singapore page of the Safe Travel website.
