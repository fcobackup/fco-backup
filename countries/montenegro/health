If you have a health condition, or you are pregnant, you may need specialist healthcare abroad. Check whether your destination country can provide the healthcare you may need and ensure you have appropriate travel insurance for unexpected medical evacuation or local treatment.
See the Coronavirus travel health and Healthcare sections in the Coronavirus page for COVID-19 health information.
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you are abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you are travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For more information on controlled and legal medicines, contact The Montenegro Customs Administration or Montenegrin Agency for Medicines and Medical Devices. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctorâ€™s prescription.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
You should apply for a free UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before leaving the UK. If you already have an EHIC, it will still be valid as long as it remains in date.
There is a reciprocal healthcare agreement for British nationals visiting Montenegro, which entitles you to free treatment for genuine emergencies. In order to exercise this right, you should present a British passport and some evidence of being insured in the UK to the office of the Health Fund of Montenegro and obtain a certificate. A GHIC card will suffice for that purpose, but for free emergency care and financial reimbursement, the request to local authorities for a certificate must be submitted in advance of the medical treatment or as soon as possible after urgent admission to hospital. More detailed information can be found on our living in Montenegro page.
The reciprocal agreement does not cover repatriation to the UK or any additional costs, so we highly recommend taking out adequate travel health insurance to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. Read more about what your travel insurance should cover.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 124 to contact the ambulance service directly. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Montenegro does not recognise UK prescriptions. You should ensure that you bring sufficient supplies of medication with you, and if you need medication while travelling, you should speak to a pharmacist who will tell you if you need a prescription from a local GP. While pharmacies across the country stock a solid supply of medicines, not all medicines prescribed in the UK are available in Montenegro. It is illegal to order medicines from abroad and import them by post to Montenegro.
