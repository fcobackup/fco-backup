This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Singapore set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Singapore
Only Singapore citizens and permanent residents can enter Singapore without prior permission.
If you’re a long-term resident (holder of an employment pass, S Pass, work permit, foreign domestic work permit, long-term visit pass, or student pass), you may enter Singapore if you are fully vaccinated and if the Singapore government has approved your application to enter.
Short-term visitors are allowed only from certain countries. The list changes at short notice, so you should visit Singapore’s Safe Travel website for updated information.
Singapore has introduced varying entry permissions depending on your vaccination status, country of origin, and purpose of visit (such as on compassionate/medical grounds). You should use the self-help tool on the Safe Travel website for more details.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Singapore will only accept the UK’s letter version of proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. They will not accept digital proof. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Entry permission guidelines
If you’re allowed to enter Singapore, you need to:
take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test within 48 hours before departing for Singapore
quarantine for 10 days at your home in Singapore (if everyone you are staying with has the same travel history as you) or otherwise in a hotel if you spent the last 14 days in the UK or most other countries (countries in Singapore’s Category III). The guidelines vary depending on which country you’re arriving from, so you should check the guide for travellers on the Safe Travel website
arrivals from the UK need to take a PCR test on arrival, ART tests on days 3 and 7 of quarantine and a further PCR test on day 10
have travel insurance of at least S$30,000 covering COVID-19 hospitalisation and treatment
These guidelines can change at short notice, so you should visit the Safe Travel and Ministry of Health websites for up-to-date information.
All work pass holders must comply with all Singapore government regulations or face their passes being revoked and/or fines/jail.
Entry rules: foreign crew for ships and small vessels/pleasure craft
Apart from the guidelines above, there may be other measures in place for foreign crew working on ships, small vessels or pleasure crafts at one of Singapore’s marinas. Before applying for entry into Singapore, contact your port agent and/or the Maritime and Port Authority to find out what prevailing Covid-19 measures are in place.
Quarantine requirements
Everyone granted permission to enter Singapore will be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival and arrivals from most destinations will be issued with a ‘Stay at Home Notice’ (SHN) for 10 days. For arrivals from the UK this can be at in your place of residence in Singapore, if everyone in your household shares the same travel history as you, or otherwise it must be in a hotel room. The cost must be met by the traveller. Children or vulnerable people are usually allowed to serve their SHN with an appropriate carer.
Testing and quarantine rules vary depending upon your travel history. Full details of exemptions including testing requirements and quarantine information can be found on the Singapore Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) ‘Arrival in Singapore’ and ‘SafeTravel’ webpages. You should check these websites for updates and review SHN details before travelling.
Everyone aged over 12 who is in home quarantine will need by law to wear an electronic tag for the duration of their quarantine period. The tags are about the size of a watch and are worn on the wrist.
In addition to quarantine fees, all arrivals must pay for COVID-19 tests. For arrivals from the UK there is a PCR test on arrival, ART tests on days 3 and 7 of quarantine and a further PCR test on day 10. While you’re serving quarantine you will not be allowed to leave your room/place of residence. Smoking may not be allowed in government allocated quarantine facilities. The quarantine period cannot be reduced, even if you wish to leave Singapore. Failure to comply carries a fine and a jail term of up to six months. More details can be found on the Singapore government website.
Transiting Singapore
Singapore’s Changi Airport allows transit of passengers only in certain circumstances. Check with your airline before undertaking a journey via Singapore. You should also familiarise yourself with new transit procedures for Changi Airport before travelling.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You don’t normally need a visa to enter Singapore for stays of up to 90 days for tourism, business or social visits. You may be eligible to enter Singapore using the enhanced Immigration Automated Clearance System (eIACS) under the Frequent Traveller Programme.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Singapore. If you’re intending to transit Singapore to neighbouring countries, make sure your passport is valid for at least 6 months. You may be refused entry or turned away by airlines if your passport does not meet this requirement.
Entry is normally refused if you have a damaged passport or pages missing. Make sure your passport is in good condition before arriving in Singapore. Being refused entry can result in significant cost and a long stay at the airport.
Travelling while pregnant
Women who are more than six months pregnant no longer need to get permission before travelling, but the final decision on the length of stay permitted rests with the immigration officer on arrival. Prior entry clearance is needed for women intending to give birth in Singapore. You can apply at the High Commission for the Republic of Singapore in London or the nearest Singapore Embassy/High Commission if you’re not in the UK.
Customs regulations
Importing certain controlled drugs and pirated copyright material is prohibited and there are restrictions on entering with items like replica guns, radio communications equipment, and weapons and ammunition (including empty cartridge cases and air guns). For more information visit the travellers section of the Singapore Customs government website.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Arriving from the Middle East
If you’re arriving from an airport in the Middle East, you may be subject to screening for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). If you display symptoms, you may face quarantine or further testing.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Singapore. Your ETD should be valid for at least 6 months. No visa is needed on an ETD when entering or transiting Singapore.
