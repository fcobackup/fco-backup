See our coronavirus travel advice for guidance on travel during the COVID-19 outbreak, including on cruise ship travel.
British Nationals planning to visit Sweden should be aware that travel options to and from the country are now limited due to Covid-19 related restrictions. While there are still options for direct flights between Sweden and the UK at present, this may change in the near future. Airlines are cancelling or reducing significantly their international flights to and from Stockholm and Gothenburg. Check with your airline for latest information. If you are in Sweden and want to return to the UK in coming days, it would be prudent to plan to leave sooner rather than wait.
The Danish Government announced that it was closing its borders for a month as of 1100 GMT on Saturday 14 March. Those normally living and working in Denmark will still be able to enter the country from Sweden. In addition, those who need to transit through Denmark in order to return to their place of residence will be able to. However tourists and those the Danish authorities say cannot demonstrate a recognised purpose (residence, work, delivery of goods, transit) to enter Denmark will not be allowed to cross the border. There may be further updates to how these policies take effect as the Danish and local authorities implement this ruling over coming days.
More than 850,000 British nationals visit Sweden from the UK each year. Most visits are trouble-free.
