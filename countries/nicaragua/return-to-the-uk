If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Nicaragua, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
Flights
Many airlines have stopped their flights. Aeromexico have recently cancelled a number of flights. Their last flight to leave Nicaragua is on 9 April to Mexico City. Onward travel is still possible via Toronto or Dallas, with Air Canada and United Airlines. This is your last opportunity to leave by commercial means. The domestic airline La Costeña appears to be operating as normal. Resident and non-resident British nationals in Nicaragua who wish to leave should contact their airline or tour operator.
Travel via Costa Rica or Honduras
Leaving Nicaragua by land via a neighboring country is no longer possible as both Costa Rica and Honduras have imposed entry restrictions.
