Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Armenia.
The Government of Armenia has declared a state of emergency from 16 March to 14 April.
Entry and borders
The Armenian authorities have introduced severe restrictions on people entering the country. The majority of foreign nationals who have travelled from or via countries with outbreaks of COVID-19 within 14 days of travel will not be allowed to enter Armenia during this period. This ban on entry currently applies to UK citizens.
Travellers able to enter Armenia will be subject to health screening measures on arrival which may include self-isolation, quarantine or hospitalisation.
On 24 February the Armenian authorities announced that the Meghri border crossing with Iran would be closed and scheduled flights between Armenia and Iran would be suspended, other than for Armenian and Iranian citizens to be returned to their respective countries.
With effect from 14 March, the borders between Armenia and Georgia will be closed for the movement of people, other than for the return of the citizens of each country to their country of origin. This does not apply to the movement of goods.
Foreign nationals are currently allowed to leave Armenia on regular commercial flights, though the majority of airlines have suspended routes. Visitors seeking to depart Armenia should aim to do so while commercial options remain open. Travellers should contact their carriers directly for the latest information and guidance.
Local measures
The Armenian authorities have also introduced a number of other emergency measures and restrictions, including a ban on public gatherings of over 20 people. You should follow the advice of local authorities.
Further information
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Armenian Embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
