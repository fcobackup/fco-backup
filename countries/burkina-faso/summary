The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for Burkina Faso remains in place:
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to:
the capital Ouagadougou, up to the toll booths on all roads out of the city
The FCO advise against all travel to:
the rest of Burkina Faso
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Burkina Faso, including Ouagadougou. Attacks could be indiscriminate, affecting Burkina Faso security forces, religious sites, restaurants, schools and places visited by foreigners. Further attacks are possible. You should exercise particular caution around religious holidays. See Terrorism
There’s also a risk that terrorist groups may cross the border from Mali and the northern border with Niger into Burkina Faso to carry out kidnap attacks. On 11 May 2019, four hostages, including westerners, were rescued during a French military operation in northern Burkina Faso. Two of the rescued hostages were French tourists who had been kidnapped from Pendjari National Park in Benin on 1 May 2019. See Kidnap
In June 2019, Burkina Faso passed a law criminalising the dissemination of information about terrorist attacks and security forces that could undermine public order or the conduct of security operations.
A state of emergency remains in place in the Est and Sahel regions, the western provinces of Kossi and Sourou, the central-eastern province of Koulpélogo, the western province of Kénédougou and northern province of Lorum. The measure gives security forces extra powers to search homes and restrict freedom of movement.
UK health authorities have classified Burkina Faso as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Consular support is severely limited in Burkina Faso where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel. British nationals should contact the British High Commission Accra in Ghana in the first instance who can provide consular support. The Honorary Consul in Burkina Faso can offer limited consular assistance.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before travelling.
