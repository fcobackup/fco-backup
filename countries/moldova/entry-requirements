The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Moldova
The Ministry of Health has established a new set of rules for entering Moldova. The red and green list of countries is no longer applicable.
On entering Moldova, all arrivals must complete an epidemiological form that declares information about your state of health (relevant to the COVID pandemic) and confirm that you will self-isolate for 14 days unless you are exempt.
You will be exempt from self-isolation if you present one of the following documents:
proof that you have received both doses of an approved vaccination. The second dose must have been administered at least 14 days before your date of arrival. Current rules do not specify whether electronic documents are acceptable as proof, but you are recommended to present your vaccination certificate in paper form
negative result of a PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before your date of arrival;
negative result of a rapid antigen test taken no more than 48 hours before your date of arrival;
a confirmation of the presence of COVID-19 antibodies (serological test) that is valid for a period of 90 days from the date of the test;
Other exemptions are set out below, under Quarantine Requirements section.
All documents are accepted in the following languages: English, Romanian, Russian, French, Italian and German
More information on the entering rules can be found at https://www.moldpres.md/en/news/2021/08/14/21005913
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Moldova will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
A number of further exemptions exist, as set out below under Quarantine requirements.
You should contact your travel operator and air carrier for more information before travelling to Moldova.
You should check for updates on border crossings with Ukraine and Romania on the Moldovan Border Police website.

Data collection
Upon arrival to Moldova, you must fill out an epidemiological form. This form is to be submitted to immigration officials.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Visas are no longer required to enter Moldova if your stay is under 90 days. For all other types of travel, contact the Embassy of the Republic of Moldova in London. See below for information on entry into Moldova.
The Moldovan authorities strictly enforce penalties (including deportation) against foreign visitors who overstay the terms of their visas. As a visitor you are allowed to spend no more than 90 days in any six months period in Moldova. At any official point of entry, your arrival date will be registered automatically. Please see below for details of entry through Transnistria.
Residence and/or work permits are required for stays over 90 days. Immigration, residence, and work permits usually need to be extended annually, but can be issued for up to five years. Alternatively, you must regularise your stay by applying for a residence or work visa.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least six months and have at least one unused page.
Entry into Moldova via Transnistria
If you’re entering into Transnistria overland from Ukraine (for example by bus or rail) be aware that the Transnistrian border guard will not place entry stamps into passports, but you will receive a registration document. Keep this document until your departure and present it at the border. The service is free of charge.
If you cross the border by road, there are 6 check points with immigration controls, where you can receive a registration document.
If you cross the border by rail, there are no ‘immigration controls’ and your passport won’t be stamped. In this case, within 3 days, you should go to the Bureau for Migration and Asylum in Chisinau (124 Stefan cel Mare Boulevard) to register your stay.
Alternatively, you could go to the local offices of the Bureau for Migration and Asylum located in: Hîrbovăț in Anenii Noi; Hajumus in Căușeni; Pîrîta in Dubăsari, Criuleni in Criuleni, Rezina in Rezina and Sărătăuac în Florești.
To register your stay you must present the following documents:
your passport
proof of travel (for example a Green Card if you drive a vehicle into Moldova; air/ bus/train ticket)
Failure to register may result in fines and difficulties when leaving Moldova.
Entry into Moldova via Ukraine
If you enter Moldova overland from Ukraine do so at one of the internationally recognised border crossing points between Moldova (excluding the Transnistria segment) and Ukraine in the north and south of the country.
Entry into Transnistria
There are no ‘immigration controls’ in place on the internal boundary between Transnistria and Moldova proper and entry stamps won’t be placed into passports. But on entering Transnistria you will be required to fill in 2 copies of a migration card, one of which should be retained and produced on exit. You may also be questioned on the aim of your visit, duration and where you will stay.
