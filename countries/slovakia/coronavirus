Public spaces and services
The Slovak government has imposed restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19.
From 5am on 19 December, there are nationwide restrictions on movement outside the home. This curfew applies until 29 December, but is expected to be extended further until mid-January. Exceptions to the curfew include:
Going to work, doing essential shopping, and accessing essential services such as banking and post offices
For medical appointments including C19 testing, care of relatives and of pets
For recreation (maximum 2 households), walks in the countryside, and individual sports
Church services, attending funerals of close family, or to get married
Journeys in order to travel abroad, or to return home from foreign travel
Further information (in Slovak only) is on the Interior Ministry website.
Other important previous measures also remain in force:
Facemasks must be worn outdoors in all built-up areas, such as towns and villages. The wearing of facemasks remains compulsory indoors, including on public transport and in shops. Masks are not required in the countryside if you are with others from the same household or can maintain a five-metre distance
A maximum of 6 people from 2 households may meet, unless all are from the same household
Local public transport is running, but face masks are compulsory
Hotels and guest houses are permitted to remain open but with restrictions. Hotels can only accept guests who have a negative covid test result no older than 72 hours. The same applies to ski lifts.
Restaurants, bars and cafés may only operate a takeaway service
The number of people in shops is restricted and temperature checks may be carried out at the entrances. You must maintain a two metre distance when queuing. Supermarkets and chemists have reserved shopping hours between 9am and 11am for those over 65
