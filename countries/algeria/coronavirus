Since 1 July, given a recent increase of confirmed Covid-19 cases, local authorities nationwide, have powers to enact additional measures in cluster areas, with the approval of central authorities. As a result, localised lockdowns are possible, and markets and other areas with a high concentration of shops could be shut down for at least 15 days.
All security services and local authorities have been instructed to rigorously monitor and enforce compliance with preventive and other social distancing measures. Penalties include fines up to the equivalent of £600, and 6 months imprisonment.
The wearing of facemasks became mandatory on 24 May in all public spaces, including when using public transport, and within private cars and taxis.
No intra-regional travel is yet possible, only within provinces.
Accommodation
Accommodation is not open. There are designated hotels for repatriated Algerians to do the required 14 days quarantine on arrival.
Public places and services
All schools, nurseries, universities and mosques remain closed, and sporting events have been cancelled.
There is a nationwide ban on family gatherings of any kind, including marriages.
Some coastal governors have closed beaches.
In provinces where there is no curfew, restaurants with outside space/terraces are able to reopen as long as they abide by the necessary sanitary/social distancing measures.
In the 19 provinces still under curfew, only takeaway deliveries are allowed.
