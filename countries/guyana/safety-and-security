Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.      
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Guyana
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Guyana, attacks cannot be ruled out.
Political situation
There are occasional protests and political demonstrations throughout Guyana.   
Border areas
Venezuela disputes the legitimacy of its border with Guyana. Political tensions have increased following Venezuela’s decision to hold a referendum on 3 December 2023 on the status of the Essequibo region. The security situation may deteriorate in the border areas. 
The UN’s International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea in 2007 ruled on the maritime border dispute between Suriname and Guyana. However, there remains a historical border dispute over the land in the New River Triangle area in the south-east of Guyana.
Check with local authorities if travelling near the border areas, both of which are in remote areas.
Crime
Crime levels are high, and police capacity is low. There are frequent armed robberies, hold-ups, carjackings and other violent crimes, often involving 2 or more attackers. Passers-by can get caught up in gunfire even if they are not targets because police are armed and shoot back.
Violent attacks and personal safety
Muggers can attack in broad daylight, often holding their victims at gunpoint or knifepoint. They may target tourists, particularly if those that show obvious signs of wealth.
Areas where you’re most at risk are:
Tiger Bay and Albouystown in Georgetown
Sophia, south Georgetown
Buxton
Agricola
Stabroek Market area - where robberies are a daily occurrence
Avoid walking alone around Georgetown, even in the main areas, and do not walk anywhere at night.
Foreign visitors have been assaulted in Georgetown’s botanical gardens. If possible, go with an organised group and avoid taking valuables.
There have also been incidents of violent theft by gangs who follow cars from Cheddi Jagan International Airport and attack their victims when they reach their destination. Always drive with windows closed and doors locked.
Never try to exchange money or buy goods on the street – go inside the money exchange or shop. You must also be vigilant when leaving local banks as you could be followed. If possible, arrange to be collected by a car or taxi booked by your hotel or with a licensed operator. 
Protecting your belongings
Thieves will take items from hotel rooms, parked vehicles or luggage if it is unattended. Keep your passports, money, tickets, mobile phones and other valuables as secure as you can, and use hotel safes or safe deposit boxes if possible.
Scams
Scammers often offer travellers in South America free air tickets to Guyana. On arrival their ‘sponsors’ will only allow them to leave Guyana if they carry a ‘package’ (usually cocaine). The authorities at the airport will stop and search foreigners that fit this known profile.
Laws and cultural differences
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Drug trafficking is a serious problem. You can get lengthy prison sentences and heavy fines for possession or trafficking of drugs. The minimum jail sentence for illegal drug offences is 3 years, and prison conditions in Guyana are tough. Pack all luggage yourself and do not carry any items that do not belong to you.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual activity is illegal. In practice, these laws are rarely enforced, and there is growing local support for LGBT+ rights. However, showing affection in public may attract negative attention.   
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Hotel safety
A small hotel fire in the centre of Georgetown in August 2018 highlighted poor safety procedures in some hotels. Check evacuation procedures and exit routes when you arrive, and speak to hotel management if you have any concerns.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Guyana, see information on driving abroad.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Guyana. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get the correct version of the international driving permit (IDP). After 60 days you’ll need to buy a 4-week foreign driving permit.    
If you’re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.
Driving standards and road conditions
Driving in Guyana can be dangerous because of reckless drivers, frequent hazards, inadequate street lighting and poor road conditions. Drive with extreme caution and avoid driving at night. Take extra care to avoid cyclists, pedestrians and animals. Keep a safe distance from minibuses – minibus drivers are responsible for many of the road accidents in Guyana.
If possible, avoid travel to and from Cheddi Jagan International Airport late at night and before dawn. There have been fatal accidents caused by erratic driving.
Taxis and minibuses
Although private taxis can be targeted by robbers, they are the safest way for visitors to get around town. Use taxis from reputable companies and book them in advance or from official hotel taxi ranks.
Do not hail taxis from the roadside and avoid using minibuses for travel.
River and sea travel
There have been armed attacks against fishing boats in and around the waters of Guyana and Suriname. Take all possible precautions against piracy and armed robbery at sea.
If you are travelling on Guyana’s rivers, use registered boat services equipped with life jackets. Do not travel by boat after dark.
Use scheduled ferry services only when crossing the Corentyne River between Guyana and Suriname. Using water taxis (‘backtracking’) from Suriname to Guyana is illegal and can lead to arrest, imprisonment and then deportation.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Flooding
Guyana is vulnerable to flooding. The main rainy seasons are generally May to June and December to January. The coast of Guyana is below sea level and protected by a sea defence and dam system. However, the anti-flooding infrastructure and drainage systems are poorly maintained
