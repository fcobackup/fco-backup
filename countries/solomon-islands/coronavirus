The Solomon Islands authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Travel restrictions
Effective immediately, all non-citizens of Solomon Islands are not permitted to enter. British Nationals attempting to travel to Solomon Islands will not be able to enter.
The Government of Australia has announced that from 9pm Australia Eastern Standard Time on 20 March, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March. As many flight connections to and from Solomon Islands connect in Australia and New Zealand, options to depart Solomon Islands have reduced. If you’re currently a visitor in Solomon Islands, you’re advised to prepare to leave as soon as possible. If you’re resident in Solomon Islands, you should be aware of the potential impact of the border closures and flight restrictions on future travel plans.
British Nationals wishing to leave Solomon Islands via a transit in Australia must first complete the Australian Department of Home Affairs COVID-19 Enquiry form in order to obtain permission to transit Australia. The form can be found here.
For British Nationals seeking to leave via Australia on any forthcoming available flights:
The Australian Border Force has confirmed that British Nationals can transit Australia from Pacific Island airports but must secure an exemption as soon as possible.
British Nationals should have onward connections within eight hours of their arrival. This need not be on the same calendar day as long as the airport is open 24 hours (Brisbane is).
British Nationals should complete the Australian online exemption process then email the following details to the British High Commission in Honiara:
your name and contact details
when you completed the online process (and any reference number)
which flight to Australia you intend to travel on
your passport details: full name, DOB, passport number (or attach a photograph of your passport details page)
The British High Commission will pass your details to Australian authorities. However, please note that exemptions are a matter for the Australian authorities and cannot be guaranteed.
All incoming travellers must complete a Traveller’s Public Health Declaration card and also provide full details of their place of stay, travel itinerary and current personal contact details in Solomon Islands for 14 days after their arrival in Solomon Islands.
The Solomon Island Government advises that anyone who is preparing to travel to the Solomon Islands should self-assess their health and, if thought to display symptoms of the COVID-19 virus, are strongly advised not to travel.
If you’re currently a visitor in Solomon Islands, you’re advised to prepare to leave as soon as possible. If you’re resident in Solomon Islands, you should be aware of the potential impact of the border closures and flight restrictions on future travel plans.
