Entry and borders
Land borders are closed to entry by non-Kosovo citizens. It is possible to leave the country by land, but a number of border crossings with neighbouring countries are closed for passenger traffic, and neighbouring countries have also placed restrictions on international travel. You should check FCO travel advice for the relevant country before attempting to cross a border.
Local measures
There are a range of local measures to limit the spread of the virus:
all schools, cafes, bars, restaurants and shopping centres have been closed. Food stores and pharmacies remain open.
public transport has been restricted.
there are restrictions on public gatherings.
a number of events in Kosovo in the coming weeks and months have been cancelled.
residents are required to stay in their homes for all but essential journeys, especially those over 65 years old.
when outside, you are required to keep your mouth and nose covered and maintain a distance of 2m from other people.
The Government of Kosovo has announced a gradual easing of restrictive measures beginning on 4 May. Check the Ministry of Health website website and Facebook page for more details.
From 4 May, people over the age of 16 are allowed outside of their place of residence for two 90 minute periods during the day, dependent on the date and the penultimate digit of their ID or Passport number. You can check the times people are permitted to be outside their place of residence on the Ministry of Health online coronavirus platform.
