Uzbekistan-Afghanistan border
Exercise caution and vigilance if travelling near the border with Afghanistan, and follow the instructions of the local authorities.
The border crossing with Afghanistan, the Friendship Bridge, remains officially closed to foreigners, and the FCDO continues to advise against all travel to Afghanistan.
The banks of the Amudarya river, which form the border between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, are fenced off, and there is a significant military presence within that area, known as the “neutral zone”. You risk arrest if you approach the fence or take photos of military infrastructure or personnel in the neutral zone.
Many of the tourist sites close to the border require the permission of the local authorities to visit, or require you to be part of an organised tour group.
In April 2022, rockets were fired from Afghanistan into southern Uzbekistan. Islamic State Khorasan Province claimed responsibility.
