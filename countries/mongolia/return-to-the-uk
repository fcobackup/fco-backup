All scheduled commercial flights have been cancelled but there are occasional charter flights leaving Mongolia. The UK government is working closely with the Mongolian authorities regarding charter flights and options for British people to return to the UK.
Flights
The government of Mongolia has announced the following charter flight:
15 January: Seoul
British nationals may be able to purchase tickets for the outward leg from Ulaanbaatar. If you wish to leave on this flight you should send your name, contact details and a photo of the ID page of your passport to consular.mongolia@fco.gov.uk by midday Mongolia time on 11 January.
As further information becomes available it will be shared on these pages and on the British Embassy Ulaanbaatar Twitter and Facebook sites.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when youâ€™re back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCDO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCDO.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Mongolian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible. This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.
