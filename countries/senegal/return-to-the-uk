There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Senegal. The Government of Senegal has closed land borders and airspace has been closed to commercial airlines except for flights with ‘special authorisation’. We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Senegal. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Senegal authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you cannot leave Senegal at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Senegal authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible. This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. The British Embassy continues to work with airlines that have ‘special authorisation’ for flights to support British travellers returning home. If you would like to register your interest in any possible future flights, please email ukinsenegal@fco.gov.uk.
