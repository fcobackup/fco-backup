Entry and borders
The government of El Salvador have introduced a number of precautionary measures including banning entry to foreigners. Only Salvadorans, foreign residents and accredited diplomats are permitted to enter the country, and even then under strict conditions which include quarantine in a government facility.
El Salvador International Airport has suspended passenger flights until at least 21 May, and will only receive air cargo and humanitarian flights in the meantime.
The closure of the airport is the part of a series of restrictions introduced by the Government with little to no advance warning. British nationals remaining in El Salvador should be prepared for further measures to be introduced at short notice.

Local measures
A state of emergency has been declared. This suspends some freedoms of assembly and movement. A 24/7 national curfew is in place until 21 May, with exceptions only for designated essential workers. Anyone leaving their accommodation must wear a mask. Movement between municipalities is no longer permitted and public transport (including taxis) has been suspended.
The Government has encouraged municipalities to introduce further measures. You should familiarise yourself with any additional measures in your local area. You should comply with these and other emergency measures. Hundreds of people have been detained and sent to quarantine facilities for breaking the curfew and stricter controls have been introduced from 7 May.
Key services (including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, petrol stations and home delivery food outlets) will operate. One individual per household can go out to buy essential supplies from outlets within the municipality in which they live on designated days according to the final digit of their Salvadoran identity document or, in the case of foreigners, residency or passport; shops are checking compliance on entry. Schools and universities and many other businesses and organisations, including restaurants and take away food services, are closed.
Quarantine
Following confirmation of the first COVID-19 case on 18 March, President Bukele announced that anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 would be required to receive care in a Government designated facility, to reduce the risk of transmission.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. For further information, please check with the Salvadoran General Directorate of Migration and the Ministry of Health webpage.
Visas
If your visa is due to expire you can extend it during the curfew without leaving your accommodation by visiting Salvadoran Migration services for foreigners - you will need to complete the process once movement restrictions are relaxed.
