The Bulgarian authorities have declared a national state of emergency until 13 April.
Borders and travel
The Bulgarian Government have announced severe restrictions on international travel, forbidding entry to British nationals from midnight 17/18 March, except for those with permanent or long term residence in Bulgaria, and closing the border with Turkey for passenger traffic.
