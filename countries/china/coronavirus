Coronavirus travel health
Check the latest information on risk from COVID-19 for mainland China on the TravelHealthPro website.
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Direct flights between the UK and mainland China have resumed, following the earlier ban on direct passenger services imposed by the Chinese authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Check with airlines for routes, schedules and ticketing.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in China.
You should check local testing facilities information on the National Health Commission website.
Those failing pre-departure health checks in China, including children, will be contacted by host authorities and will be required to isolate in a designated facility. You will remain in isolation until you have tested negative for COVID-19. The decision on whether quarantine is at a designated centre or if it is possible to quarantine at home rests with local authorities.
You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. Whilst we cannot prevent this, if it happens to you or is about to happen, you can call +86 (0)10 8529 6600 for 24/7 urgent consular assistance. Non-residents may be charged for their care. For further information on healthcare in China, see the Health section.
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions or testing put in place, or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes that may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are and seek treatment until you test negative.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in China
Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health kit apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history have been lifted in most areas, but COVID-19 test results are still required for access to nursing homes, medical institutions, childcare facilities and schools.
Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements for travel between different parts of the country have been removed, although there are reports of travel still being restricted. You should check latest developments with local authorities ahead of domestic travel, including on PCR testing requirements.
The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory lockdowns in response to fresh outbreaks remains. Such lockdowns may result in disruptions to medical and other basic services, including food delivery. You should ensure you have prepared additional food, water and medical supplies in case you are mandated to isolate locally.
If you are planning to leave China in the near future you should regularly check with your airline for updates, and consider that local lockdowns may have an impact on your travel plans.
Healthcare in China
China is currently experiencing a large number of COVID-19 cases; medical facilities and supplies of medication may come under strain in response. You should ensure you have a supply of medication for COVID-19 or flu-like symptoms in case of infection. A negative COVID-19 PCR test result remains a requirement for entry to medical facilities, but the Chinese government has stated it will not refuse medical care to those who do not have this test result.
Medical facilities are largely functioning as normal but quarantine restrictions may delay or limit access to such care. View Health for further details on healthcare in China.
