If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Spain
You should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect yourself and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus.
Some public health measures to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 remain in force across Spain and may vary between regions. See Use of face masks and Public spaces and services for further information.
Regional governments retain legal powers to ease or tighten restrictions within their region if deemed necessary to control the spread of the virus (e.g. partial lockdowns; limiting the capacity and opening hours of retail, hospitality establishments and public events, COVID passports).
Local and regional restrictions may be introduced at short notice. You should consult regional incidence levels, refer to the advice of local authorities in your destination and ensure you are aware of the specific measures in place prior to travel.
Public spaces and services
Rules may vary between regions. You should refer to local and regional authorities for advice.
You should continue to observe the following rules regardless of your whereabouts in Spain:
obligatory use of face masks on public transport, in pharmacies, medical centres and care homes (see Use of facemasks)
abide by any safety measures put in place by establishments such as hotels, bars, shops and restaurants to reduce the risk of COVID-19 such as social distancing and other public safety precautions
wash your hands frequently and thoroughly and use hand sanitizer gel where soap and water is not available
Proof of vaccination
Spain will accept the UK’s COVID-19 vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Use of face masks
The use of face coverings is mandatory for anyone over the age of 6 years if you are in the following situations:
on any form of public transport in Spain
visiting a hospital or medical centre (including other healthcare settings such as dentists, opticians, pharmacies etc.)
visiting a care or nursing home
Face masks must cover the nose and mouth.
In addition to the mandatory use of face masks in the above situations, the Spanish government recommends you use them responsibly in the following circumstances:
enclosed public spaces such as shops, cinemas, bars and restaurants
at large events (e.g. concerts, sporting events)
when in the company of people considered clinically vulnerable or high-risk and social distancing of 1.5m cannot be observed
at family gatherings
in any other enclosed communal spaces open to the public
Those with respiratory problems or those unable to wear a mask due to other health conditions or disabilities are exempt. More details are available from the Ministry for Health (in Spanish).

Developing symptoms or testing positive for COVID-19 in Spain
If you think you have symptoms or test positive for COVID-19, you should call your regional hotline. Most of the regional hotlines listed have English speaking staff. Some regions offer alternative helpline numbers for those calling from non-Spanish mobile phones:
Andalusia: Tel. +34 955 545 060
Balearic Islands: Tel. +34 971 211 991
Canary Islands: Tel. +34 928 301012 for Gran Canaria province or +34 922 470012 for Santa Cruz de Tenerife province
Catalonia: Tel. +34 933 039 944
Hotels and other accommodation providers may have their own COVID-19 protocols in place. You should abide by any safety measures put in place by your accommodation provider. Your accommodation provider may have a list of private doctors that they can call to assess your symptoms and conduct a COVID-19 test.
Remember that an EHIC or GHIC covers state healthcare only, not private treatment. You will be responsible for the cost of any treatment provided by a private doctor or hospital.
You are not required to self-isolate if you have mild or no symptoms but you should wear a mask and avoid crowded spaces.
You should follow the advice of the local authorities at all times.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Spain
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Spain announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Spanish national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. British nationals resident in Spain are eligible for vaccination. Spain operates its health system regionally, therefore the way people access the vaccine will differ depending on where you live. You should refer to your regional health authority for information regarding the vaccination plan in your area. If you are already registered for public healthcare you should be contacted by your regional health service to make an appointment when it is your turn to be vaccinated.
Further information is available below if you live in Spain but are not registered for public healthcare, for example, if you have private health insurance.
For more general information from the Spanish government regarding vaccines in Spain, see their vaccination strategy (only available in Spanish).
