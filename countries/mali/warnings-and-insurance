Reports of terrorist attacks in Bamako on Tuesday 17 September
There were reports of terrorist attacks on Tuesday 17 September in Gendarmerie School in Faladi√© district and near Modibo Keita International Airport in Bamako. Avoid the immediate area of the incidents, consider travel movements within Bamako and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Inbound and outbound flights, including international flights, can be cancelled at short notice or diverted to an alternative location. Monitor messages from your carrier, and be prepared to make arrangements to stay overnight in a safe location.
UK government support
Support for British nationals is severely limited in Mali, especially outside Bamako. If the security situation deteriorates, the British Embassy may be increasingly limited in the help it can provide. Do not rely on FCDO being able to help you to evacuate in an emergency.
If you are in Mali and need emergency help from the UK government, contact the British Embassy in Bamako.  
Travel insurance
If you choose to travel, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
