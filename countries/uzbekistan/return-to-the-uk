There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Uzbekistan. All commercial flights in and out of the country have been suspended.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Uzbekistan. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Uzbek authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you cannot leave Uzbekistan at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.
Future travel options
The possible flight from Dushanbe to Frankfurt that we communicated earlier is no longer available.
There are currently both direct (on 29 April) and indirect flights (via Doha on 27 and 28 April and via Warsaw on 28 April) from Seoul to London Heathrow. Please check with airlines directly as the information on departure flights are subject to change at short notice.
It is important to note that South Korean authorities will require evidence of onward travel from Seoul to final destination(s) and it will be passengers’ responsibility to arrange this. Please refer to FCO Travel Advice on South Korea, which includes details of measures in place at Incheon airport to monitor transit passengers for symptoms of COVID-19.
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Uzbek authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
