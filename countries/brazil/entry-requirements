Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Brazil.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Brazil’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Brazil set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Brazilian Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Brazil.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Brazil, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can visit Brazil without a visa for up to 90 days for tourism.
If you want to extend your tourist visa, contact the Federal Police (in Portuguese) before your visa expires.
For more information about visas, contact the Brazilian Consulate in London.
If you overstay your visa, you’ll face a daily fine. You have the option to pay this fine either when you leave Brazil or during your next visit.
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
Make sure the border control officer puts a stamp in your passport. If it is not stamped, you may be fined when you leave.
Read about passport stamping if you live in Brazil (in Portuguese).  
British-Brazilian dual nationals
Brazilian immigration authorities often require dual British-Brazilian nationals visiting Brazil to travel on Brazilian (rather than British) passports.
Travelling with children
Children with dual British-Brazilian citizenship
British-Brazilian dual nationals under the age of 18 who are travelling without both parents or legal guardians need authorisation from both parents or legal guardians to travel in Brazil or leave the country. Read more about the formal travel authorisation process for Brazilian minors and the frequently asked questions.
Children who are not dual British-Brazilian nationals
Families of non-Brazilian under-18s travelling through Brazil without one or both parents should follow the instructions for dual British-Brazilian under-18s. Make sure the under-18 or their travelling companion also carries the original or notarised copy of the under-18’s birth certificate. Contact the Brazilian Consulate in London for more information.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Brazil guide.
Customs rules  
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Brazil. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
Taking money into Brazil 
If you are bringing cash or travellers cheques into Brazil with a value of 10,000 US dollars or more, you will need to declare it online.
