If you choose to travel to or stay in Afghanistan against FCDO advice, you should monitor media reporting and make sure you have robust contingency plans in place. Be vigilant at all times, keep others informed of your travel plans and vary your routes and routines.
Political situation
The majority of Afghanistan is now under Taliban control. The political situation remains uncertain and could change rapidly.
The risk of violence around political events and rallies remains. You should avoid all political demonstrations and public gatherings. Keep up to date with developments in the security situation, including through monitoring local media.
Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs)
There have been a number of serious attacks on both western and Afghan NGOs and vehicles belonging to them, in which people have been killed or injured. NGO workers have been kidnapped near their places of work. Most attacks continue to occur in the east and south of Afghanistan with a recent increase in activity in the central areas. The International NGO Safety Organisation (INSO) issues regular security updates for NGOs.
Road travel
Road travel is highly dangerous. The security situation has significantly increased the risks associated with travel and any road move within the country is highly dangerous.
The situation at border crossings between Afghanistan and its neighbours continues to be impacted by the security situation in Afghanistan. A number of borders remain closed and if opened, can be subject to unannounced closures at short notice. Compliance with neighbouring state rules on coronavirus testing and quarantine measures also applies.
We advise against all travel to and around Afghanistan.
Air travel
Commercial flight operations have restarted at a small number of airports in Afghanistan. We advise UK nationals travelling overseas to take account of any safety notices published by the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) when considering whether to use an air carrier.
