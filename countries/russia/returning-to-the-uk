The authorities in the countries bordering Russia set and enforce entry rules. Before you travel, check the foreign travel advice for any countries you plan to travel through. If you need consular assistance contact that country’s British Embassy, High Commission or Consulate. Consider checking with your transport provider or travel company that your passport and other travel documents meet their entry requirements.

Leaving Russia by air
There are currently no direct flights operating between the UK and Russia.
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) identifies foreign airlines which do not fulfil the necessary international safety standards, and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the United Kingdom. Its purpose is to help UK travellers to make informed decisions on which air carriers to use when flying overseas. If you are travelling overseas, take account of the UK ASL when considering which carriers to fly with.
From 8 April 2022, all Russian-certified air carriers were included on the UK ASL. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, published by the UK Civil Aviation Authority. If you are seeking alternative air routes or other means of travel, e.g. road or rail, consult local travel providers.
If you are in Russia, it is not possible to fly directly to the UK, or via EU countries, and should amend any travel plans accordingly. However, there are limited numbers of commercial airlines operating indirect flights via the Middle East, Serbia and Turkey. Check the latest information with your airline or travel provider.
The full list of countries who have closed their airspace for Russian aircraft has been published by the Russian aviation authorities (available in Russian only. The website may not be supported on all devices).
