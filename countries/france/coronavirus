Travel in France
There continues to be a sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in France. France has put measures in place to limit the spread of the virus.
The French government has announced a national lockdown from 00:01 on 30 October. As a result, you should remain at home unless you need to go out for an essential reason. This includes shopping for food, attending medical appointments, looking after someone, and accompanying children to school. You will also be able to leave your home for exercise (including going for a walk) – you must remain within one kilometre of your home and be outside for no longer than one hour.
You will need an attestation (or self-certificate) when you do go out. The attestation is available on the Ministry of Interior website, and through the digital app ‘Tous anti-Covid.’ Those needing to travel within France, between 30 October and 1 November, to return to their home address, will need to fill out an additional attestation to declare this, which is accessible at the government’s public services website.
Travel between departments will not be allowed, unless for a reason specified by the government. Public services will remain open but non-essential businesses, restaurants, and cafes will close. Schools will remain open.

Public spaces and services
Wearing face masks in enclosed public spaces has been compulsory since 20 July. This applies to those aged 11 and over. Local authorities in an increasing number of cities and regions (including Paris), have extended this to also include outdoor public spaces. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine. Please refer to local guidance for more information.
Since 11 May, wearing masks on public transport has been compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen.
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.
