Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Italy from the UK
You must show evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result when you arrive in Italy from the UK.
The test needs to have been in the 48 hours prior to your arrival and should be a molecular (PCR) or an antigenic test. You’ll be asked to show proof of your test date and result at the border. If you cannot prove this, you’ll be required to undertake a 14-day self-isolation period, which will be monitored by the Italian health authorities. It may no longer possible to get a test on arrival at Italian airports.
Do not use the NHS testing service to get a test to travel to Italy. You should arrange to take a private test.
Everyone arriving in Italy must also call the COVID-19 helpline for the region you are travelling within 48 hours, to inform them of your visit.You can read more about the requirement to get a COVID-19 test (including when you might be exempt) on the Italian Embassy in London website.
Special restrictions during the Christmas period
Between 21 December 2020 and 6 January 2021 the requirement to provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test will be removed. Instead, all arrivals (regardless of nationality) must self-isolate for 14 days.
If you will be travelling to Italy during this time, you should be prepared to complete a self-declaration form stating your personal details and the address at which you will self-isolate.
Measures for all travellers
In addition to the above measures, all travellers to Italy must;
download and complete a self-declaration form from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before travel. You must provide this to your airline/transport provider, or to the border police if you are stopped for checks.
self-isolate on arrival for 14 days if, in the 14 days prior to your arrival in Italy, you have stayed in or transited through a country where Italy continues to require self-isolation. If these conditions apply to you, then you must report promptly to the local health authorities. If you cannot self-isolate for 14 days for any reason, then entry to Italy may be refused.
More information on these requirements is available on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs frequently asked questions page.
Many airlines and airports serving Italy have resumed service, but their schedules may be different to normal and subject to change. You are strongly advised to check your airline’s website, as well as the website for the airport you are intending to fly to for the latest information. You should also expect to be asked to wear a face mask throughout your flight and within the airport terminal.
