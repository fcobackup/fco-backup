COVID-19 restrictions in New Zealand are subject to change at short notice and can apply regionally or nationally. New Zealand‘s COVID-19 Protection Framework uses a traffic light system. You can find detailed information on current COVID-19 levels and the restriction measures that are being enforced on the New Zealand Government website.
Although not mandatory, some businesses, public venues and events in New Zealand may require evidence of vaccination status (such as the My Vaccine Pass). Capacity limits for indoor venues and localised restrictions may also be imposed by the New Zealand Government.Read the full guidelines on the New Zealand Government COVID-19 website.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in New Zealand
