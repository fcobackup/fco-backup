This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 112 and ask for an ambulance.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccinations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip check:
the latest information on vaccination recommendations and health risks in TravelHealthPro’s Moldova guide
where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Water quality
Only drink bottled or boiled water.
HIV risk
The UNAIDS 2010 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic estimated that around 12,000 adults aged 15 or over in Moldova were living with HIV. The prevalence was estimated at around 0.4% of the adult population compared to the UK rate of around 0.2%. Take normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV and AIDS.   
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in Moldova
State medical facilities in Moldova are generally poor. Private clinics and hospitals offer a better standard of care. If you are involved in an accident or taken ill, it is likely that you would be taken to a state hospital.
Most medical service providers in Moldova will expect cash payment for their services at the time of treatment. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment and repatriation.
FCDO has a list of medical facilities in Moldova where some staff will speak English.
