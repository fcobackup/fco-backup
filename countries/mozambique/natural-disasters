Mozambique is regularly affected by natural disasters, including floods, drought and cyclones. Cyclones and floods are particularly common during the rainy season (November-April).
A weather system which may develop into a Tropical Cyclone, is forecast to bring hazardous sea and weather conditions to the Zambézia, Sofala and Inhambane provinces of Mozambique from 19 February 2021. Floods and landslides are likely in affected areas. Monitor local reports and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation, check your routes before travelling around the country and follow the advice of the local authorities.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a tropical cyclone.
