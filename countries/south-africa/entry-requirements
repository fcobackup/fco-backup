Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to South Africa
International commercial air travel to South Africa has resumed. You will be required to produce a paper copy of a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test upon arrival in South Africa. The test must have taken place no more than 72 hours before your departure. We advise that you carry several paper copies of your test, as you may need to present it at different points on your journey. If you do not present proof of a test upon arrival, you may be required to quarantine in a government quarantine facility at your own cost.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
The South African authorities have said you must have travel insurance which should cover a COVID-19 test and quarantine costs in case you display COVID-19 symptoms whilst in South Africa. You will need to provide proof of accommodation upon arrival in case you need to self-isolate during your trip.
Business travellers providing services across the borders between South Africa and the Southern African Development Community are allowed multiple entry subject to producing a certificate of negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) result not older than 72 hours from the time of departure. This certificate is valid for 14 days.
For any questions regarding the process to enter South Africa, you should speak to your local South African High Commission.
Transiting South Africa
It is possible to transit South Africa and travel to a third country. If you wish to transit through South Africa, you must bring a paper copy of a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test result. The test should not be older than 72 hours from the time of departure. We advise that you carry several paper copies of your test, as you may need to present it at different points on your journey. If you cannot produce a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test then you may be quarantined for 10 days in government-appointed facilities at your own cost.
Screening on arrival
Screening processes have been introduced at all major ports of entry, including airports, for arrivals, departures and transit passengers. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Additional screening may include temperature measurements and check on recent travel to affected areas.
Quarantine requirements
If you fail to produce a paper copy of a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test you will be required to quarantine at a government-appointed facility at your own cost. Self-isolation is not required if you have provided the negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test.
Data collection
The South African government requires you to complete a health declaration form with your details on arrival, including your address, contact information, and recent travel history.
Testing on departure
Screening processes have been introduced at all major ports of entry, including airports, for arrivals, departures and transit passengers. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Screening may include temperature measurements and check on recent travel to affected areas. If you feel unwell, you should not attempt to travel. Presenting at the airport with symptoms may result in you being sent to a government health facility for quarantine and further testing. You should make sure that your insurance will cover unplanned travel disruption due to coronavirus.
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 30 days beyond your intended date of exit from South Africa, in line with South African immigration regulations. However, some immigration officials still request that a passport should have at least 6 months validity on the date of entry to South Africa. To avoid problems at the airport on arrival, you’re advised to ensure your passport is valid for six months.
Travelling with children
There are special requirements for travelling to South Africa with children under the age of 18. There are different requirements for unaccompanied children entering South Africa.
Check the advisory from the South African Department of Home Affairs for more details, and consult your nearest South African high commission or embassy if you have any questions about these requirements.
Residence permits
If you have Permanent Residency in South Africa, you can leave and re-enter South Africa but must carry valid documentation with you proving your permanent residency rights. When re-entering South Africa you will be asked to produce a paper copy of a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test not older than 72 hours from time of departure to port authorities. Failure to do so will result in you being sent to a government-appointed quarantine facility at your own cost.
Receipts issued by the Department of Home Affairs for applications to renew a permit will not be accepted by the immigration authorities. For more information, contact the South African High Commission or the South African Department of Home Affairs.
Dual citizenship
If you hold South African citizenship, you must enter and exit South Africa on your South African passport. It is an offence for a South African citizen aged 18 or over to enter or leave the country on a foreign passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
South African authorities advise that UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from South Africa.
ETDs should have a minimum of 6 months validity for entry, transit or exit.
Biometric capturing
South Africa has implemented biometric capturing at all ports of entry. This may result in some delays at land borders. You should allow additional time for border crossings.
