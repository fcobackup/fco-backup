Earthquakes
Albania lies in a seismically-active zone, and tremors are common. Serious earthquakes are less frequent but do occur.
A series of earthquakes occurred in western Albania in the early hours of 26 November 2019. The largest quake, registering 6.4 on the Richter scale, was centred north of the port city of Durres (approximately 20 miles from the capital, Tirana) and caused loss of life and extensive damage to property.
To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see this advice from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Winter weather
From December to February, severe weather may cause flooding, particularly in northern Albania. Heavy snowfall in mountainous areas can lead to disruption to transport and services. Monitor local and international media for the latest information.
