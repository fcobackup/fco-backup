This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in St Lucia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
From 2 April 2022 there are new rules for unvaccinated travellers (both resident and non-resident) arriving in St Lucia, that may restrict accommodation and movement for the first 7 days.
Cruise ship passengers should read entry protocols for anyone arriving on a cruise ship.
Testing and Quarantine requirements
From 5 April the rules are:
All travellers must print out the Health Screening Questionnaire from the St Lucia Government website, complete it and bring it with them
Fully vaccinated travellers and in-transit passengers no longer need to have a test before travel to St Lucia. You must have proof of being fully vaccinated (completed 14 days before travel) and have the certificate at airline check-in, boarding and on arrival in St Lucia
All unvaccinated travellers must have a negative RT- PCR COVID-19 test, taken up to five days prior to entering Saint Lucia. UK NHS tests are not valid for travel
St Lucia accepts the following tests: nasopharyngeal sample, oropharyngeal sample, nasal sample, oropharyngeal, anterior nares sample and mid turbinate samples. The following tests are not accepted: LAMP tests, self-administered tests or home kits, saliva samples
Unvaccinated passengers arriving without tests or with the wrong type of test will be tested on arrival at their own cost and will be required to remain in quarantine until the result of the test is known.
Quarantine requirements
The St Lucia Tourism Authority website has the protocols for unvaccinated residents and unvaccinated non-residents that apply for the first 7 days. Unvaccinated residents must quarantine at home for the first 7 days after arrival.
Unvaccinated non-residents must stay in COVID-certified accommodation for a 7 day visit, or for the first 7 days of a stay of 8 days or longer. During the first 7 days, unvaccinated non-residents can move to other COVID-certified accommodation and take part in certified activities. The website has details of certified activities for this period.
Any symptomatic passengers will be isolated and tested and required to remain in quarantine/isolation at your hotel. If the test is positive all visitors and nationals will be transferred to a treatment facility until they receive two negative test results and are clinically stable.
Lifting of Quarantine for Fully Vaccinated Persons
Persons who have been fully vaccinated will not be required to go into quarantine on arrival. Persons must have received their second dose 14 days prior to arrival on island. All other protocols must be adhered to such as mask wearing and social distancing. Complete list of protocols are on https://www.stlucia.org/en_UK/.
If you are travelling with children aged 5-17 years and you would like them to also be exempt from COVID rules they will need to be retested on arrival at your cost, and they must remain in isolation until the results of the test are known. Once the test is negative they will not be required to quarantine.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
St Lucia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
