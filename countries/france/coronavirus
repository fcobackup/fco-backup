Travel in France
France has put measures in place to limit the spread of COVID-19.
A national curfew is in place from 7pm to 6am. Exemptions from the curfew are very limited and only apply for those with medical needs, caring responsibilities or working in roles which cannot be done from home. Attestations (or self-certificates) to leave the house during curfew hours are available on the French Interior Ministry website and through the ‘Tous anti-Covid’ digital app. You should check the French government’s COVID 19 pages (in French) for more information.
Some areas are subject to additional restrictions in response to a rise in cases. This includes Ile-de-France (Paris), Hauts-de-France (Calais, Dunkirk, Lille), Alpes-Maritimes, (Nice) Seine-Maritime, Eure, Nievre, Rhone (Lyon) and Aube. In these areas, non-essential shops are closed. Travel to other regions is banned, apart from for professional purposes, or in exceptional circumstances. Exercise is permitted within a 10km radius. In these areas, attestations (or self-certificates) are required both for curfew and if you go further than 10km from your home. Please visit the French Interior Ministry website or use the ‘Tous anti-Covid’ digital app for further information.
These measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should check local guidance for further information.
In the whole of France, restaurants, bars and cafes remain closed, along with cinemas, theatres, museums and sport venues. Outdoor gatherings of more than six people are not permitted and are subject to fines (unless authorised).
Full information about restrictions in France can be found here.
Public spaces and services
Wearing face masks in enclosed public spaces has been compulsory since 20 July. This applies to those aged 11 and over. Local authorities in an increasing number of cities and regions (including Paris), have extended this to also include outdoor public spaces. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine. Please refer to local guidance for more information.
Since 11 May, wearing masks on public transport has been compulsory for all users aged 11 and over, with fines for those who are not compliant. Masks are also compulsory in taxis and private hire vehicles without a plexiglass screen.
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling.
