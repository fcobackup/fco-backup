Local measures
The Dutch government has announced measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Full details of these measures can be found on the Dutch government website (in English).
These measures will apply until at least 20 May. You can find further information on the latest measures from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health (RIVM) and from the Dutch government.
From 18:00 on April 17, 2020 travellers to the Netherlands from high-risk areas as listed online by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, including those transiting the Netherlands, will be required by airlines to fill in a ‘fit-to-fly’ health declaration form. This will contain questions about your situation and health, including whether you have symptoms of Covid-19. You may be refused permission to board based on your declaration. On arrival in the Netherlands your declaration will be checked by public health and security authorities. Travellers from high-risk areas are also strongly advised by the Dutch government to quarantine themselves for at least 14 days.
Further information
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
