You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Cambodia you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
International flights
There are very few remaining international flights out of Cambodia and they are reducing rapidly as a result of travel restrictions in the region and globally.
The FCO assisted the departure of British nationals and dependents from Phnom Penh on a special commercial flight on 14 April. The only other flight option out of Cambodia to the UK is via Seoul with Korean Airways (limited availability). Contact your airline or Travel Company and your insurance provider as soon as you are able, and keep up to date with the latest developments.
The British Embassy is issuing regular updates on its Facebook page.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
There are no restrictions on travelling to the airport either from within Phnom Penh or from the provinces.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
