Crime
There’s no history of crime within the Territory. The Territory has no indigenous population and the only residents are personnel who work at the few scientific research stations in the Territory.
Local travel
There are no scheduled air links to the Territory and there are no road links within the Territory.
Almost all access to Antarctica is by sea only.
In winter (March-October) the Territory is inaccessible. During the Austral summer (November-February) there will be times when, because of the prevailing westerly winds and lack of sheltered anchorage, landings may be difficult.
