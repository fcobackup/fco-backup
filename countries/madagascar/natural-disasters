The cyclone season in Madagascar normally runs from November to April. Coastal areas are particularly affected, and remote areas throughout the country can become inaccessible and suffer damage and contamination to water supplies. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), Meteo Madagascar (French) or FB Cyclone Indien Ocean (French, Malagasy).
Tropical Cyclones Batsirai and Emnati hit Madagascar in February 2022. High winds and heavy rainfall caused damage to buildings, roads and bridges in eastern, central and southern regions, particularly on the east coast in Mananjary, Manakara and Nosy Varika, and inland along the RN7 route south of Ambositra. You should check your route before travelling to or through these areas.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if youâ€™re caught up in a storm.
