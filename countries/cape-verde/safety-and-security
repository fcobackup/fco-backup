Crime
Crime affects all islands of Cape Verde, but the number of incidents affecting British nationals is generally low. Burglaries and muggings have been reported on the main tourist islands of Sal and Boavista. Be vigilant and keep sight of your belongings at all times. Leave valuables in a hotel safe if possible and don’t carry large amounts of cash. Avoid unlit areas after dark. Some petty crimes like pick-pocketing or handbag snatching are carried out by children. Take extra care if you see groups of children who appear not to have any adult supervision.
Make sure your holiday accommodation is secure. Lock all doors and windows at night and when you go out. If you’re worried about security at your accommodation, speak to your tour operator, hotel manager or to the owner of the property.
Sexual assaults are rare but they do occur. Be alert and avoid secluded stretches of the beach, including Praia do Estoril, Praia de Chaves and Praia de Santa Monica on the island of Boavista. If you become a victim of crime, contact the local police. In an emergency call 132 (police) or 131 (fire). Response times vary and service standards may not be as high as in the UK.
Road travel
Traffic is usually light and road conditions and driving standards are generally of a reasonable quality.
The rainy season in Cape Verde is from mid August to mid October. Torrential rains can cause floods and landslides. Monitor local weather reports and expect difficulties when travelling to affected areas during this season.
Local Travel
Intercity bus services can be dangerous due to poor driving. Taxis hailed from hotels are generally reliable. In Praia, city buses and taxis are reliable, clean and in good condition. Car rental is widely available on the islands of Santiago, Sal, Boa Vista and São Vicente.
Sea travel  
Sea conditions around Cape Verde are sometimes dangerous. Take local advice before travelling by sea. Travel by sea to the southern islands of Fogo and Brava in particular can often be disrupted.
Take care if you participate in water sports, swimming, boating and fishing. Tides and currents around the islands are very strong.
Political situation
The political situation is generally stable, but you should avoid demonstrations and large gatherings
