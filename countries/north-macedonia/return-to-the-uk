There are currently no commercial means of leaving North Macedonia to return to the UK.
Skopje International Airport is closed for air traffic until further notice except for state, military, medical and emergency flights. St. Paul the Apostle Airport in Ohrid is also closed.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave North Macedonia. The UK government have been working closely with the authorities of North Macedonia and other governments to provide options for British Nationals to return to the UK
Future travel options
This travel advice and the British Embassy Skopje’s Facebook and Twitter accounts will be updated if departure options become available.
Some flight options, including operated to transit countries, could arise at short notice. Contact the British Embassy Skopje at BritishEmbassySkopje@fco.gov.uk if you are a British traveller seeking to return to the UK.
As borders reopen and restrictive measures ease, there may be options to return to the UK from neighbouring countries. You should check FCO travel advice of the relevant country for options.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.

See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
