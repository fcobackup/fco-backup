This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Liechtenstein set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Liechtenstein for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)

Eligibility to enter Liechtenstein
Switzerland handles immigration and customs matters for Liechtenstein. Entry requirements are the same as for Switzerland. There is an open border between Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The Swiss Embassy in London handles consular issues on behalf of Liechtenstein in the UK.
You may enter Liechtenstein from the UK for any travel purpose if you are fully vaccinated and can show adequate proof (detailed below).
Travellers who are not fully vaccinated are only eligible to enter Liechtenstein from the UK if they are:
Liechtenstein or Liechtenstein nationals;
EU or EFTA nationals;
holders of the following documents:
a residence permit, i.e. a Swiss residence permit (L / B / C / Ci permits);
a cross-border permit (G permit);
an FDFA legitimation card;
a D visa issued by Switzerland;
Holders of a ‘laissez passer’ issued by the Swiss Embassy in situations of special necessity.
Travellers who are not fully vaccinated and do not meet one of the exemptions outlined above may not currently enter Liechtenstein from the UK.
Travellers eligible to enter Liechtenstein who are not fully vaccinated, no longer have to quarantine on arrival in Liechtenstein.
Unvaccinated children and adolescents arriving from the UK under the age of 18 are allowed to enter Liechtenstein if they are accompanied by fully vaccinated adults.
All travellers arriving by air must complete a passenger locator form.
Travellers can see what rules apply when entering Liechtenstein or Switzerland using the online Travelcheck service.
Testing requirements
In addition to the above entry requirements, all travellers flying to Liechtenstein via Switzerland must possess either proof of vaccination, proof of recovery in the last 6 months or a negative COVID-19 test prior to departure. Negative PCR tests (not older than 72 hours) or a rapid antigen test (not older than 48 hours) are accepted. Children under the age of 16 are exempt from testing. A negative COVID-19 test will not grant your entry into Liechtenstein or Switzerland if you are not eligible to enter (i.e. fully vaccinated or exempt).
Quarantine
Travellers arriving from the UK no longer have to quarantine on arrival in Switzerland.
You should report your arrival to the Liechtenstein government within two days.
Further guidance on quarantine requirements is available from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Liechtenstein will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. However a screenshot or a photo is not sufficient. Further information is available from the State Secretariat for Migration. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
You will be regarded as vaccinated if you have been vaccinated with a vaccine that either:
is authorised in Switzerland and has been administered in full in accordance with Federal Office of Public Health recommendations; or
has been authorised by the European Medicines Agency for the European Union and has been administered in full in accordance with the requirements or recommendations of the country in which the vaccination was administered; or
has been authorised under the WHO Emergency Use Listing and has been administered in full in accordance with the requirements or recommendations of the country in which the vaccination was administered.
This includes the AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen vaccines that are available in the UK.
Proof of vaccination must include:
First and last names
date of birth
dates of the vaccination
vaccine used
Evidence of your COVID-19 vaccination status can be provided digitally (through the NHS app or NHS website) or as a printout (this can be requested from the NHS by calling 119). However a screenshot or a photo is not sufficient. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Your vaccination is valid for 12 months directly after the date of your last vaccination. For the Janssen vaccination the validity starts 22 days after the date of vaccination.
Further information is available on the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health and State Secretariat for Migration websites.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Liechtenstein and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Liechtenstein government’s entry requirements. Check with the Swiss Embassy in London what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Liechtenstein with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Liechtenstein or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Liechtenstein border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Liechtenstein as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in the Liechtenstein your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Liechtenstein border control. For further information see our Living in Liechtenstein guide.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements:
It must be less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’).
It must be valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’).
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry and exit from Liechtenstein.
Working in Liechtenstein
If you intend to work in Liechtenstein, you should get detailed information on employment regulations from the Migration and Passport Office (in German).
