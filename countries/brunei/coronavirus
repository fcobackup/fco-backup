Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Coronavirus lockdown
Brunei has now lifted all pandemic restrictions in country. Wearing a mask is no longer mandatory (indoors or outdoors). Masks and/or Antigen Rapid Tests may be required in health facilities and may be required by event organisers. Masks are still required for those who handle food preparation (e.g. at eateries).
All individuals, regardless of vaccination status, are allowed to enter public premises and government offices and attend private and public events.
Temperature checks and scanning the BruHealth app before entering premises is no longer mandatory. Self-isolation for COVID-19 positive individuals is encouraged, but not mandatory (different establishments e.g. schools may have their own regulations on this). Close contacts of COVID-19 positive individuals no longer have to self-isolate.
British people travelling should check the Brunei Ministry of Health and the Prime Minister’s Office websites for up to date guidance, policy on travel to/from Brunei and details on how to download and use the BruHealth app.
