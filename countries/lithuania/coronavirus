If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Facemasks
You must wear a medical facemask in all indoor public spaces in Lithuania, including shops, restaurants, businesses, workplaces, museums, theatres, public transport, taxis and educational environments.
Masks should be three layers of non-woven material and bear the CE marking on their marking on their packaging.
These rules do not apply to children under the age of six, or people with a medical exemption. If you cannot wear facemasks on medical grounds, you are advised to wear face shields if possible. Exemptions also apply to those doing physical exercise, providing a service that cannot be done with a facemask, or consuming food or drink.
Public places and services
The Lithuanian Government no long requires individuals to prove their vaccination status in order to access non-essential services.
More information on COVID-19 related restrictions to public places and services in Lithuania is available on the KoronaStop website.
Healthcare in Lithuania
Most healthcare services are operating as normal, but there may be occasional delays to appointments. If you have a medical appointment, check with the service provider to confirm whether the appointment can take place as planned.
COVID-19 tests in Lithuania
If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been in close contact with a confirmed case within the previous 7 days, call the Lithuanian COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963 to request a COVID-19 PCR test. The hotline is open daily between 8am and 11pm. In case of an emergency, call 112. Tests booked through the hotline are free of charge.
If you are required to have a test for the purposes of travel, you will need to book your test through a private clinic. A list of private clinics offering PCR and antigen tests is available on the Lithuanian Ministry of Health website. The tests booked through these clinics will be charged.
Not all testing centres in Lithuania offer results in English. If you require your results in English, you should request at the point of booking. English language result certificates are likely to incur additional charges.
If you do not have access to a private vehicle, you will need to travel to the testing centre by taxi. You are advised to check at the time of booking whether the taxi company is able to take you to a testing centre, as some taxis may not have the precautions in place to provide this service.
Testing positive for COVID-19 in Lithuania
If you test positive for COVID-19 with an antigen test, you should immediately register for a PCR test. Call the Lithuanian COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963 to request a COVID-19 PCR test. The hotline is open daily between 8am and 11pm. You must self-isolate until you receive your results and instructions from public health officials, even if you are asymptomatic.
If you test positive for COVID-19 with a PCR test, you must self-isolate for up to 14 days, depending on the instructions of your GP/Lithuania public health officials.
While in isolation, you must:
not leave your place of isolation without the permission of a healthcare professional;
not go to the shops;
not attend face to face public services;
not have guests/visitors;
organise for essential provisions to be delivered by friends, family or delivery services;
consult with a GP by phone/email to arrange extensions to prescriptions;
call the Lithuanian COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963 if you display COVID-19 symptoms; and
call the Emergency Response Centre on 112 if your symptoms become severe.
The Lithuanian Government advises against self-isolating in properties with those who are not isolating. If this is not possible, you should stay in separate, well-ventilated rooms, restrict your movement within the home and minimise use of common spaces. Children who test positive for COVID-19 may isolate with a parent or guardian, but they must also adhere to self-isolation rules. You will be expected to cover the cost of your self-isolation accommodation, if you are unable to stay in a private property.
While in isolation, you should expect to be contacted by Lithuanian health officials. Please note that not all public health officials speak fluent English, so you may need to request to be called back by an English Speaker. Public health officials may ask you to provide:
A list of individuals with whom you have been in close contact in the 7 days leading up to your first symptoms or to your day of testing, if you are asymptomatic. Close contacts are considered to be those people with whom you have been less than two metres apart for 15 minutes or more, without facemasks; and
A list of locations that you have visited over the previous 7 days and the time of your visit.
If you have a pet, but are unable to arrange alternative pet care, you may leave your place of isolation for up to 15 minutes at a time to walk your pet. This exception only applies to individuals who have no COVID-19 symptoms.
British nationals needing to temporarily break isolation, who meet one of the requirements set out by the Lithuanian Government, must notify the NVSC in advance. You do not need to inform the NVSC if you are breaking isolation for a COVID-19 PCR test or for emergency medical treatment.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Lithuania
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Lithuania announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Lithuanian national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and uses Pfizer-BioNTech, Astra Zeneca, Moderna, and Janssen vaccines. British nationals resident in Lithuania are eligible for vaccination. UK nationals with Lithuanian residency may register for a vaccination in Lithuania over the phone on +370 5 230 0123 or email klausimai@ulac.lt. More information about the Lithuanian government’s vaccine priorities and estimated timeline for mass vaccination is available on the KoronaStop website.
Children aged five years and older are eligible for vaccination in Lithuania. Children aged five to 11 years (inclusive) will be offered a reduced volume dose of Pfizer-BioNTech (Comirnaty) vaccine. Children aged 12 to 16 years will be offered either standard Comirnaty or Moderna (Spikevax) vaccines.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad page. If you’re a British national living in Lithuania, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
Lithuania offers COVID-19 boosters to all residents aged 18 and over, from four months after they completed their first course of COVID-19 vaccine. British nationals resident in Lithuania who wish to register for a booster should call +370 5 230 0123 or email klausimai@ulac.lt.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Lithuania, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
