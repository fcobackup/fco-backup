Inter-island travel
Due to community spread of COVID-19, islands and cays have been categorised into three levels (level one: low risk; level two: high risk; and level three: grave/critical risk). Inter-Island travel between level one islands (Acklins, Chub Cay, Crooked Island, Inagua, Long Cay, Long Island, Mayaguana, Ragged Island, and Rum Cay) is permitted.
All other inter-island travel is restricted and subject to change at short notice. Details of the travel health certificate for domestic travel are available from the Bahamian government website. During the lockdown period (18 to 25 August 2020), domestic travel is only allowed between level two and level three risk islands by private charter preapproved by the Office of the Prime Minister and the Bahamian Civil Aviation Authority (BCAA).
Public places and services
A complete lockdown is in effect on the island of New Providence from 18 to 25 August 2020. The complete lockdown is intended to curb COVID19 community spread through restrictions on the freedom of movement of residents and visitors. Rules for lockdown measures (access to essential and non-essential services) change on a daily basis. On 19 August, grocery shops, pharmacies, water depots and petrol stations will be open between 5:00am and 9:00pm. Updates are available at Office of the Prime Minister website.
A lockdown is in effect on the island of Grand Bahama from 18 to 25 August 2020. Essential health services, grocery stores, gas stations and water depots are open. Rules for lockdown measures on other islands and cays are available at the Office of the Prime Minister website.

Face masks must be worn in any public space and must be worn for entry into supermarkets, pharmacies and businesses.
Face masks or coverings must cover your nose and mouth; face mask must also be visible and easily identifiable.
A government issued identification must be carried on person to present at police checkpoints, which have been established on several islands.
Beaches and national parks are closed.
Socially distancing is set at 6ft apart. You may be required to stand or sit in a designated area according to the social distancing measures in place in a particular location.
Hand washing and/or hand sanitizing is required upon entry into public buildings and private establishments. A security guard may ask you to wash your hands or they may spray your hands with a disinfectant.
Health officers can order persons to be detained for screening and assessment and may order isolation or quarantine on reasonable grounds in order to prevent further spread of the disease. Visitors may incur the cost of quarantine and testing in government designated quarantine facilities.
If you are placed in quarantine or self-isolation, you may be required to download an app (Hubbcat) to enhance support and monitoring.
Failure to comply with the Emergency (COVID-19) Orders, will result in fines and/or imprisonment. On 28 June, a COVID enforcement unit of the Royal Bahamas Police Force (RBDF) was established to ensure compliance with the Emergency Orders. All Emergency Orders are available on the Office of the Prime Minister’s COVID19 section.
