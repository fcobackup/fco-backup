Curfew restrictions
On 15 March, Peru announced a national State of Emergency, which has now been extended until 24 May.
There is a nationwide curfew between the hours of 8pm to 4am. In Tumbes, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad and Loreto the curfew will start two hours early, lasting from 4pm to 4am. The Government of Peru has announced that all individuals should use facemasks when going outside.
On Sundays, no one is allowed out. The President will announce any future changes to curfew rules.
These restrictions may not apply to those who have obtained a travel permit (salvo-conducto) from the Peruvian authorities in order to travel to flights or on pre-arranged transport. If you require a salvo-conducto, you must contact the British Embassy first and we will request one on your behalf. You should note that the Peruvian authorities mainly issue salvo-conductos for those with pre-arranged international flights.
However, they can make exceptions to those who do not have a flight yet, but want to travel within Peru (from one region to another). In both cases, let us know so that we can make a request to the Peruvian authorities. Depending on your destination (region), you may have to spend some time (possibly two weeks) on quarantine immediately after arrival. The exact location of the quarantine will be decided by the regional government upon arrival.
Relaxing of restrictions
The Peruvian government has approved a four-phase Economic Reactivation Plan, between May and August which involves relaxing some restrictions and reopening some industry sectors such as Industry and Mining, Construction, Trade and Tourism and Services. For Tourism and Services, the plan involves reopening or restarting the following:
first phase (May): Restaurants (via delivery), hotels and storage
second phase (June): Inter-provincial transport and flights, restaurants (restricted service)
third phase (July): International flights, restaurants and hotels operating normally
fourth phase (August): Leisure activities, conventions, meetings, gatherings
This planned relaxation of industry restrictions remains under review and may change at short notice.
Visas
During this period the Peruvian authorities have also confirmed that fees will be waived for overstays on visas owing to the State of Emergency.
