Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Mozambique. There has been an increasing intensity of attacks in areas of Cabo Delgado province dating back to January 2019. Most recently, there was a large-scale attack on Palma in March/April 2021 in which dozens of people were killed. Militants have used explosives, machetes and firearms to conduct lethal attacks, as well as burning vehicles and homes. Attacks have been carried out on the mainland and on islands off the coast, including in areas frequented by foreigners. There are reports of an increased security presence in the province, including road blocks, and there are regular clashes between militants, armed vigilante groups and Mozambican security forces. There is also a threat of kidnap in Mozambique, which is particularly acute in northern districts of Cabo Delgado province. See Terrorism
Coastal areas are at risk from tropical cyclones during the rainy season (November to April). Widespread flooding can also occur around river basins, especially the Zambezi, Pungue, Buzi, Limpopo and Save. The rainy season (November to April) will also make roads harder to pass, and make some areas impassable. See Natural disasters.
Most visits to Mozambique are trouble-free, but violent crime does occur and there have been cases of criminal kidnappings. You should take extra care. See Crime
Traffic accidents are common due to the condition of the roads, poor driving and vehicle standards. Always drive carefully and be aware of pedestrians using the roads. If you’re travelling by road make sure you have relevant documents with you at all times and monitor local media for traffic updates. See Road travel
Piracy remains a significant threat in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. See Sea travel
