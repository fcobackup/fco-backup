Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Russia.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK who choose to travel against Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Russia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Russia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Russian Embassy or a consulate in the UK.
Biometrics
As of 1 December 2024, foreigners entering Russia at Moscow airports Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo, Vnukovo or Zhukovsky will be required to register, on arrival, their biometric details such as fingerprints and photographs.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Russia, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date your visa expires.
You cannot enter Russia using a visa in an expired passport, even if you’re also carrying a new, valid passport. You will need to apply for a new visa or visa transfer.
Sign your passport before you travel if it was issued after January 2017. Some British nationals have been denied entry for not signing their passports.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Dual nationals
If you have dual British-Russian nationality and travel to Russia to renew your Russian passport, it may take up to 4 months to get your new passport. You will not be able to leave Russia on your British passport if you entered Russia on your Russian passport. You will have to stay in Russia until your new Russian passport is issued.
Children born outside of Russia, and added to their parents’ Russian passports may need their own passport to leave Russia. Check with the Russian Embassy in the UK before you travel.
See Warnings and insurance for information about severely limited UK government support and compulsory military service for British-Russian dual nationals.
Visa requirements
You must get a visa before you travel.
Applying for a visa
See the Russia Visa Centre for further information on how to apply for a visa, including processing time and fast track services.
If you live in the UK and are aged 12 or over, you must go to a visa application centre in London, Manchester or Edinburgh to submit biometric data (fingerprints).
If you’re a British national with a Russian national in your immediate family, you can apply for a multi-entry private visa for up to one year. Check what you need for your stay with the Russian Embassy in the UK.
The Russian authorities strictly enforce visa and immigration laws. Before you travel, check:
your visa details are correct
the terms and conditions of your visa
Overstaying your visa
If you overstay your visa, you may face fines, court hearings, deportation or a ban from re-entry.
From 1 January 2025 until 10 September 2025, foreign nationals who have exceeded the terms of their legal stay in Russia need to apply to the Russian internal affairs authorities to regularize their stay or leave Russia. The application process includes biometric checks, medical screening for dangerous diseases, drugs and psychoactive substances tests, and checks for any outstanding payments of duties, taxes, fees, fines, and other mandatory payments.
After 10 September 2025, anyone without the necessary permits or visa will be entered on an official surveillance register, deported from Russia, and banned from re-entering.
Immigration cards
You must sign an immigration card at passport control every time you enter Russia.
Immigration officials keep one half. They return the other half to you. You must keep it and show it at passport control when you leave Russia or your departure could be delayed.
You will need to show your immigration card when you exchange money or check into your accommodation.
Questioning on arrival in Russia
There have been intensive security checks on foreign nationals at the Russian border. Some British and dual British-Russian nationals have been:  
stopped and questioned about political views or contacts with Ukraine or Ukrainians
had fingerprints and DNA swabs taken 
asked to provide data from phones and other electronic devices 
held for many hours for identity and electronic device checks, sometimes without access to refreshments 
Under Russian law, you do not need to release your electronic device for checks unless you are presented with a search warrant. However, if you refuse to release your device, you may face substantial delays entering Russia due to continued questioning and pressure to cooperate, including threats of legal action.  
You should: 
tell family, friends or colleagues about your travel plans and explain that the arrival process might take longer than usual 
stay calm and avoid confrontation if you are stopped 
be prepared for a long delay, and potentially to be refused entry to Russia  
The UK government cannot interfere in Russian immigration decisions and cannot help you during questioning.
Registering with the authorities
You must register with the local authorities if you’re staying anywhere for more than 7 working days. Your hotel will do this automatically. If you’re staying with someone, check that they’re doing this.
You must show evidence of your registration at passport control when you leave Russia. Police also carry out routine checks. If you cannot show your registration and passport, you may get a fine.
Travelling between Russia and Belarus
As of 11 January 2025, foreign citizens with a Belarusian or Russian visa may enter, leave, stay or transit through either Belarus or Russia during the period of validity of the visa. This is limited to certain international border crossing points. For more information, see the website of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Russia guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that you can take into and out of Russia. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
You must complete a customs declaration form if you import certain types of goods worth more than 10,000 US dollars (or the same amount in other currencies), including:
electrical items
jewellery
antiques
valuable musical instruments
Cannabidiol (CBD)
Cannabidiol (CBD) is illegal in Russia, even in products purchased legally elsewhere. This includes oils, edibles and vapes. If you’re found with CBD products you may be sentenced to several years’ imprisonment.
Taking money into or out of Russia
You can carry foreign currency worth up to 10,000 US dollars into or out of Russia without declaring it.
You cannot leave Russia with foreign currency worth more than 10,000 US dollars, even if you declare it.
Electronic items
You must get a licence before you travel if you want to import certain electronic items, such as GPS instruments. Check with the Russian Embassy in the UK before your travel.
Antiques and art
There are strict regulations on the export and import of antiques, artworks and historical items. You must get an export permit from the Ministry of Culture and declare each item when you leave. It is illegal to import or export items without a permit.
Customs declaration forms
Make sure a customs official stamps your customs declaration form when you enter. If you do not get a stamp, the authorities may confiscate your money or goods when you leave, or you could get a fine.
Keep receipts of any purchases in case you need to show them when you leave Russia.
Accessing money in Russia
The Russian economy is unstable. This could make access to goods and services difficult.
Mastercard and Visa are not operating in Russia. Mastercard and Visa cards issued outside Russia will not work at Russian shops or ATMs. Cards issued inside Russia will work in, but not outside, Russia. You may not be able to access your money through Russian banks or make payments to Russian businesses with non-Russian credit or debit cards.
For all other credit or debit cards, let your provider know you’re travelling to Russia to avoid your card being blocked for anti-fraud reasons.
There are few remaining methods of transferring money to Russia. UK Banks may refuse to transfer funds to even non-sanctioned banks. There have also been several cases of UK bank accounts of non-UK residents being closed at short notice. Make sure that you have enough money to cover your stay and have plans on how to access funds if your current methods become unavailable.
Buying Russian roubles
It is illegal to pay directly for general transactions in Russia using foreign currency. It is difficult to get Russian roubles in high street banks in the UK. If you want to buy roubles in Russia, you must take US dollars or euros to exchange.
Only change money at banks, hotels and exchange bureaus. It is illegal to change money from street traders.
The UK government has sanctioned several major Russian banks. This means British nationals are banned from making funds available to these banks. See more information about Russian sanctions and what this means for British nationals.
