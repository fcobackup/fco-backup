Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Venezuela
Entry into Venezuela is currently limited to Venezuelan citizens and foreign national residents.
All visas and accreditations issued on or before 13 March 2020, including entry stamps for tourists/visitors, will automatically extend until the national emergency decree in place related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is officially lifted.
British nationals in country with an expired visa, or that have gone over the maximum 90 days allowed for tourists/visitors, will be allowed to depart via commercial means without any inconvenience.
Quarantine requirements
COVID-19 testing and quarantine on designated state-run health facilities is compulsory for travellers entering Venezuela.
Testing on departure
Passengers departing Venezuela might undergo a medical assessment at their departure point, including answering questions on possible symptoms and having their temperature checked. Individuals exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms will not be allowed to depart.
In order to travel across states from certain regions of the country, such as leaving Margarita Island in Nueva Esparta state for example, authorities might request individuals to be COVID-19 tested before they are allowed to depart.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you’re arriving by air, you can enter for up to 90 days on a tourist card issued on arrival. You must have a valid return ticket. If you’re arriving overland or by sea, you must get a visa in advance from your nearest Venezuelan Embassy or Consulate.
If you are overstay the 90 days you may be arrested and fined when departing. Extensions of up to 90 days can be arranged at any SAIME (immigration service) for a fee but you must apply before your tourist card and stamp expire. If you are living in Venezuela, the only place where you can apply for or extend your residency permit is the main SAIME office in Caracas. Avoid companies offering residency permits as they may not be genuine.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 6 months beyond your period of intended stay in Venezuela.
Dual nationality
Any dual national Venezuelan must use their Venezuelan identity documents to enter and leave the country. The authorities may not allow you to depart Venezuela otherwise.
Travelling with children
Children travelling unaccompanied, with a guardian, or with one parent must provide a letter from the non-travelling parent(s) confirming that they consent for the child to travel without them. This letter must include all the travel details and must be notarised by a local notary public. If the child is resident overseas, the letter must be notarised by the nearest Venezuelan consulate/embassy. The child should carry this letter while travelling within in the country and also when leaving Venezuela. Children may be denied exit from the country if they do not have this letter.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Venezuela. The ETD must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your period of intended stay in Venezuela. The usual visa requirements for land and sea arrivals apply.
