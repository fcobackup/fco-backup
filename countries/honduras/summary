Honduras has closed its land, air and maritime borders for the transit of people. On 1 May, the FCO chartered a special flight to help British Nationals in Honduras return to the UK. The British Embassy continues to work closely with the Honduran authorities, international governments, and airlines on all possible options for British Nationals still in Honduras who wish to Return to the UK
A curfew is in place until 12 July 2020, with stricter rules in areas where there are confirmed cases. See Staying during coronavirus
There is no British Embassy in Honduras. Consular support may be limited in Honduras, with the exception of Tegucigalpa and the Bay Islands, and severely limited in more remote areas. See Consular assistance
There is a risk of dengue fever in Honduras. For information on avoidance, please visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre Website
Protests can happen anywhere in Honduras. Although normally peaceful, these can rapidly turn violent and be accompanied by a general break-down in law and order, including looting. The police have frequently responded with tear gas; deaths and injuries have also been reported. Although the protests are normally restricted to the main cities (especially Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba), road blocks can occur anywhere at short notice, and can cause significant travel disruptions; Tegucigalpa’s Tocontin airport was also closed for most of a day in late May 2019. Military police and the army were deployed across the country to restore law and order.
Travel plans may be impacted at short notice. You should avoid all demonstrations, and do not try to pass through blockades. You should follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator or airline, and monitor local and social media for updates.
Please monitor the situation with your tour operator and with the local authorities (COPECO) and the National Institute of Migration.
The rainy season normally runs from June to November, coinciding with the hurricane season in the Caribbean. See Natural disasters
UK health authorities have classified Honduras as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For more information and advice visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.

Avoid travelling on public buses (repainted US school buses). Private inter-city coach services are safer but not immune from attack. See Road travel
