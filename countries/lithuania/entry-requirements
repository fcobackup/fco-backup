Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lithuania
From 13 July 2020 British nationals resident in the UK may travel to Lithuania, without needing to self-isolate on arrival. All arrivals from overseas are advised to register with the Lithuanian National Public Health Centre within 24 hours of arrival in Lithuania.
On arrival at an airport, seaport or other entry point from a country where the incidence of COVID-19 has exceeded 16 cases per 100,000 of population in the last 14 days, you are advised not to use public transport to reach your place of residence. It is recommended that you use your own vehicle or ask a member of your household to take you to your place of residence. Updated information on which countries this applies to can be found on the Lithuanian Government Korona Stop website.
The movement of goods is not restricted.
