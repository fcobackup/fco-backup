This page has information on travelling to Togo.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Togo set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Togo’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
You will need a visa to enter or travel through Togo as a visitor. Visas are no longer issued on arrival. You must apply for an e-visa at least 6 days before your arrival.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Fully vaccinated passengers do not require a PCR test to enter or depart Togo. Departing passengers must complete an online immigration and health form to present to immigration on departure.
Proof of vaccination status
Togo will accept the UK’s digital proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. They will not accept the UK’s letter version or proof of recovery. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Togolese land borders are open.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Non-vaccinated passengers arriving in Togo must have a negative PCR test result dated no more than 5 days before departure. In addition, at least 24 hours before arrival non-vaccinated passengers (except for transit passengers who remain airside) must complete an online immigration and health form.
Departing non-vaccinated passengers must complete an online immigration and health form and take a PCR test no more than five days before exit. The cost of the test is CFA 25,000. You will need a print out of the results and receipt to present to be allowed to pass through immigration control and board the aircraft.
Togolese land borders are open.
Children and young people
Entry requirements for Togo are the same for all travellers, including children and young people. See All travellers.
If you’re transiting through Togo
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Please follow the guidance in the ‘If you’re fully vaccinated’ or ‘If you’re not fully vaccinated’.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to Togo’s entry requirements.
Compassionate reasons
Please contact the High Commission of Togo in London if you need to travel at short notice for compassionate reasons.

Visas
British passport holders need a visa to enter Togo. Visas are no longer issued on arrival. You must apply for an e-visa before your arrival.
