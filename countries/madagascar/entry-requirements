The authorities in Madagascar set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of Madagascar in London. 
COVID-19 rules 
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Madagascar. 
Passport validity requirements 
To enter Madagascar, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive. It must also have at least 2 blank pages.  
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements 
You can visit Madagascar for up to 15 days without a visa. You must pay a 10-euro administration fee on arrival and be ready to show your onward or return tickets. 
Applying for a visa 
If you want to stay longer than 15 days, you can buy a 30- or 60-day single-entry tourist visa on arrival at the airport with US dollars, euros or Malagasy ariary.  
You can also apply in advance to the Embassy of Madagascar in London for a tourist or immigrant visa. 
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
You can extend either of these visas to a maximum total stay of 90 days while you are in Madagascar. If you overstay, you may be detained or deported.  
Travelling with children 
A child aged 17 or under, travelling without one or either parent must carry written authorisation from the absent parent or parents when leaving Madagascar.

a polio vaccination certificate 
Health screening
Cholera
If you are entering Madagascar from a Cholera-affected country, you may be asked by airport authorities to take an anti-cholera drug (Doxcyline). Anyone who is unable to take Doxcyline should be offered an alternative medication by the health authorities.
Alternative medication will be provided to those that:

You may only export other plant and animal products if you get permission.
Taking money into Madagascar 
You can take up to 400,000 Malagasy ariary into Madagascar.
