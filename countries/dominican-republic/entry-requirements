This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in the Dominican Republic set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of the Dominican Republic in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering the Dominican Republic.
Passport validity requirements
Up until 30 November, British passport holders can enter and leave the Dominican Republic as long as their passport remains valid for the duration of their visit. Rules may change after 30 November. Check the Dominican Republic Ministry of Tourism website for the latest information.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Checks at border control
You may be refused entry if you do not have proof of onward or return travel when you arrive in the country.
Border officials will take your fingerprints and take a photograph of you before allowing you into the country.
Entry and exit form
You must fill in an entry and exit form before arriving in and leaving the Dominican Republic. This form includes your:
customs declaration
international boarding and disembarking form
You can fill in the form up to 7 days before you arrive in the country. You’ll get a QR code, which you may be asked to show at check-in, or when you arrive in or leave the country.    
Visa requirements
You can visit the Dominican Republic for tourism without a visa for 30 days.
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Dominican Republic government’s entry requirements.
Extending your visit
You can pay to extend your visit up to 120 days by contacting the Dominican Republic Immigration Service.
Vaccine requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Dominican Republic guide.
Depending on your circumstances, this may include a yellow fever certificate. 
Children and young people     
For children aged 17 and under travelling alone, parents should check travel requirements with the airline and with Dominican Republic Immigration Service.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of the Dominican Republic (in Spanish). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
