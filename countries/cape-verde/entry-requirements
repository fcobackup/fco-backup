This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Cape Verde set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Cape Verdean Consulate-General in Rotterdam(in Portuguese) or through the Cape Verde Consular Portal email address (in English).

Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost, stolen or is damaged.

You can enter Cape Verde as a visitor for up to 30 days without a visa.
To stay longer or to travel for other reasons, you must meet the Cape Verde government’s entry requirements.
Traveller entry form
You must fill in a traveller entry form at least 5 days before you arrive in the country. This form includes an airport security fee (‘TSA’), which you must pay before you arrive.
If you’re travelling with a tour operator, check whether they can complete the form for you as part of the booking process.

Travelling with children
Children aged 17 and under travelling to Cape Verde alone, or with a person who is not their parent or legal guardian, must carry a letter of authorisation to travel from their parent or guardian. The letter must be in Portuguese and the signature must be certified by a solicitor or notary
