This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in the UAE set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you contact the UAE Embassy in the UK. 
Passport validity requirements
To enter the UAE, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
If you have a residence permit, your passport’s expiry date must be at least 3 months after the date you arrive in the UAE.
If you’re travelling through the UAE and not passing through immigration, your passport must have an expiry date at least 3 months after the date you will transit.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can get a visitor or tourist visa issued free of charge when you arrive in the UAE. You do not need to apply in advance of travel. Your passport will be stamped with the visa as you go through immigration. It will be valid for up to 90 days over a 180-day period, which will begin from the date of first entry into the UAE. The stay can either be continuous or divided across multiple visits, provided the total duration does not exceed 90 days within the 180-day timeframe. 
You could face fines for exceeding your authorised stay which may accumulate for each day of overstay. If you want to extend your stay, contact: 
for Dubai: General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs 
for the rest of the UAE: Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship
Living and working in the UAE 
If you entered Dubai on a visit visa and want to work, you must get a probationary work permit valid for up to 3 months from the Ministry of Labour. If you are caught working on a visit visa, you could get a fine or a prison sentence, and you risk deportation. 
You risk arrest if you have lived or worked in the UAE and return when:
your previous visa is not in order - for example if you did not cancel your work visa
you have outstanding debts
you have an unresolved legal issue
If you have any doubt about your status, get advice before returning from a local lawyer. 
If you have questions about your visa’s validity or expiration date, or about how to work or stay in the UAE, contact UAE Immigration directly: 
for Dubai: General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs 
for the rest of the UAE: Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship
from the UK: UAE Embassy in the UK 
Residence visas
If you apply for a residence visa, you will have to take a blood test. If you test positive for any communicable diseases like HIV, hepatitis or tuberculosis, you may be detained and then deported, without appeal. Check the health and fitness requirements on the UAE government portal.
When applying for a UAE residence visa, it is common practice for your sponsor’s representative to give their details as the contact information on your application. When your residence visa is issued, update these details using ICP Smart System services. The UAE authorities use these details when they contact you.
Previous travel to Israel 
If you have a valid or expired Israeli visa or stamp in your passport, you should not face difficulties entering the UAE as long as you do not plan to work. If you plan to work, further checks may be needed and there is a risk you may be refused entry.
If you are a British-Israeli dual national and have any concerns about entering the UAE, contact the UAE Embassy in the UK.
Leaving the UAE 
If you are subject to a travel ban, involved in legal proceedings, have unpaid debt or are a child subject to a custody dispute, you may be prevented from leaving the UAE.
Vaccine requirements  
To enter the UAE, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s UAE guide.
Customs rules 
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of UAE. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty. 
It is illegal to bring pork products or pornography into the UAE. Videos, books, and magazines may be subject to scrutiny and may be censored.
Weapons and related equipment
You must have permission from UAE customs and the UAE Ministry of Defence to bring weapons and related equipment into the UAE, or to travel through the UAE with them, no matter how small the quantity or the purpose. This includes items such as ammunition, body protection items, cleaning kits and gun belts. If you intend to bring restricted items to the UAE, read the UAE customs clearance portal.
Medication 
There are strict rules about what medications you can bring into the UAE. You will need approval from the UAE authorities to bring in medication that the UAE classes as narcotic, psychotropic, controlled or semi-controlled.  
You must get approval in advance from the UAE Ministry of Health to bring medication. Apply online to bring medication to the UAE. The UAE authorities advise that applications are normally processed within 5 working days.  
If you arrive in the UAE without evidence of prior approval, the medication will not be allowed into the UAE, and you may be prosecuted. For information on controlled medicines or the process for obtaining permission, contact the UAE Ministry of Health. Email info@moh.gov.ae or telephone +971 800 11111.  
In all cases, there are limits on the amount of medication you can bring into the UAE legally. You can bring up to 3 months’ supply of medication as a visitor, reduced to one month’s supply if the medication is included in the list requiring approval.  
You do not need to complete this approval process if you are only changing planes in a UAE airport and not passing through UAE immigration.
