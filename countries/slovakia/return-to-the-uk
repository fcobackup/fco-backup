There are limited, but increasing commercial options to return to the UK from Slovakia via Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Slovakia, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means.
Flights
Slovakia’s international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad have been closed to regular scheduled passenger flights but the Slovak government announced on 9 June that they may reopen shortly.
See below for information on indirect commercial options to fly to the UK from Vienna airport via other European destinations as well as direct flights to the UK from Budapest Airport.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Road and rail
International rail and bus services to neighbouring countries have begun to resume on certain routes, including to Vienna. You should check with the travel companies direct for the latest information on available services.
You can exit Slovakia by road, but you should check the entry requirements for any country you plan to enter.
Travel via bordering countries
There are indirect scheduled commercial flights to the UK from Vienna Airport via Frankfurt, Amsterdam and other European cities, but these may be subject to cancellation at short notice and flight schedules may mean you need an overnight stay.
There are direct scheduled commercial flights to the UK from Budapest Airport. You should contact the airlines directly.
There are scheduled commercial bus services to London from Prague.
To plan your route by road or air, check the FCO travel advice for all the countries you plan to travel through, including for any special documentation or permission you may need in order to transit.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
