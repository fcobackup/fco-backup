This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Senegal set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy of Senegal in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Senegal.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Senegal, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can visit Senegal without a visa for up to 3 months.
You need to show border officials evidence of return or onward travel and proof of your arranged accommodation. If you do not have these, you may be refused entry.
If you want to stay longer than 3 months, you must register with local authorities after you arrive. They will issue you with a Carte d’étranger, which you must carry as identification.
Vaccine requirements
You must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re arriving from a country listed as a transmission risk. This includes if you have transited through the airport of a country with risk of yellow fever transmission. Babies aged 9 months and under are exempt.
You may need a yellow fever certificate for onward travel to some other countries, due to the risk of yellow fever in Senegal.
For full details about health entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Senegal guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Senegal (in French). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
