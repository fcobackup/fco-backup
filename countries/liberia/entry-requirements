This page has information on travelling to Liberia. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Liberia set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Before travelling to Liberia all travellers must complete a Health Screening form via the Lib Travel Mobile app available from Android Play or the Apple Store. Anyone experiencing problems with the app can access a copy of the form via the National Public Health Institute of Liberia website.

All travellers aged 18 years and above must show proof of COVID-19 vaccination upon arrival. No COVID-19 test is required for travellers exiting countries that have suspended testing for travellers.
All travellers without proof of vaccination will be returned to their country of embarkation.
You will not be tested for COVID-19 on arrival at Robert’s International Airport. You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and quarantine requirements with no advance notice.
Currently all land borders (with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire) and ports are open.
Screening on arrival
On arrival at entry points, staff will check your temperature and you must wash your hands with soap and water. You will be asked to show your completed Health Screening form, proof of COVID-19 vaccination and negative test result. If you display symptoms of coronavirus, public health officials may take you to a government quarantine or medical facility.
Proof of vaccination status
Liberia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
To be considered fully vaccinated you must:
have had both doses of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccine and the second dose must have been received at least two weeks prior to arriving in Liberia, or
have had one-dose of the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at least two weeks prior to arriving in Sierra Leone
Liberia recognises the following vaccines: Janssen/JJ, Pfizer-BioNTech; Moderna; AstraZeneca; Covaxin; Covishield; BIBP/Sinopharm; Sinovac.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
If you’re intending to live in Liberia, you will need to register with the Liberian Immigration Service (LIS), Airfield New Road, Sinkor Monrovia. Visitors do not need to register with the LIS.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
British nationals need a visa to enter Liberia. You can get a visa from the Embassy of the Republic of Liberia in London.
If you are unable to leave Liberia and your visa is due to expire, you must apply for an extension. The maximum extension period is 60 days. It is only possible to extend your visa once. To apply for an extension in Monrovia, you should visit the Immigration Office at Gbarngaye’s Town, 24th Street, Sinkor. The office is open 9am to 3pm, Monday to Friday. You should ask for the Registration Section.
You must bring your passport and pay a fee of US$25. If you are staying outside Montserrado County, you should contact your local Immigration Office to seek a visa extension authorised by the Immigration County Commander. If you have already extended your visa once and it is due to expire, you must apply for a residence permit. In this case, please contact the British Embassy for advice by emailing Monrovia.GeneralEnquiries@fcdo.gov.uk.
