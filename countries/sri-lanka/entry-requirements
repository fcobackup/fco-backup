This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Sri Lanka set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Sri Lankan High Commission in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Sri Lanka.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Sri Lanka, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to. 
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have an e-visa in advance to visit Sri Lanka for tourism or business. Follow the guidelines for tourists issued by Sri Lanka’s Immigration and Emigration department.
Applying for an e-visa
You must go online to arrange and pay for a Sri Lanka e-visa in advance – at least a few days before you travel. You should get your approval letter within 24 hours, and you can use this to enter Sri Lanka.
You can also complete your online arrival form up to 3 days before you arrive. The service is free and may save time on arrival.
Tourist visas are normally valid for 30 days. If you overstay your visa the police could issue a fine or detain you. If you want to extend your stay, contact the Immigration and Emigration department.
You do not need a visa if you’re travelling through Sri Lanka by air, as long as the connecting flight is within 24 hours of your arrival. Check with your airline about transit times.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Sri Lanka, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Sri Lanka guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Sri Lanka. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking money into Sri Lanka
Most major banks allow Visa and Mastercard cash withdrawals. There are ATMs in major towns and cities, but not all accept international cards.
You cannot transfer money without an exchange control permit issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
