Flights to Sri Lanka have been suspended since 19 March. If you are visiting Sri Lanka, you are strongly advised to leave now, while commercial means are available.
Speak to your airline or tour company as soon as possible, as it is likely that flight options will become more restricted in the coming days. Airlines operating via the United Arab Emirates, including Emirates Airlines and Etihad, have suspended flights out of Colombo indefinitely. Some airlines are changing flight schedules with little prior notice. You should keep in close contact with your airline or travel agent.
The British High Commission in Sri Lanka is issuing regular updates on Twitter with the latest available information for British nationals wishing to leave Sri Lanka. Your hotel or travel agency should be able to help book transport to the airport. The government has established a helpline for tourists (1912) who are facing problems booking taxis to the airport for departure. The government has confirmed that airport tickets can be used as a curfew pass to travel to the airport.
