This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Colombia as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Colombia to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Colombia
President Duque announced a State of Emergency on 18 March, announcing new measures including nationwide mandatory self-isolation for anyone over the age of 70, until 30 May. Restrictions on movement for under 18s are in place until 31 May.
Nationwide isolation measures for all are in effect until 11:59 pm on 10 May. These measures restrict social contact and movement to essential activities only. During this period, one individual per household may leave his or her home or accommodation to:
Go to the grocery store to buy food
Go to the pharmacy to pick up medicine
Walk a pet for 20 minutes in the vicinity of one’s residence
Access emergency services, including veterinarians
Attend a necessary medical appointment
Visit an ATM or bank to access financial services or get a notary
Take a licensed taxi or public bus when necessary to leave the house for one of these approved reasons.
Individual sports activity can be authorised by local administrations under certain conditions for a restricted amount of time each day. Regulations vary between regions, but social distancing rules continue to apply. Check with your local authority for more information on the specific restrictions in your area.
The use of masks is mandatory when using public transport and in areas with a high concentration of people. Those with respiratory symptoms and at risk groups (including those with pre-existing health conditions and adults over the age of 70) must always use masks in public. Cloth masks are acceptable.
Travel to the airport
If flights out of Colombia are organised during the quarantine period, travel to the airport for this purpose can be authorised by the Colombian authorities in conjunction with the Embassy.
Regional measures
Regional authorities are implementing significant further measures, including restrictions based on gender and/or identification numbers, and curfews. You should check official guidance from the relevant local authority, local news and the British Embassy Twitter page (updates in English).
Visas
The Colombian government has issued a decree stating that visas that expire during the emergency will be automatically renewed for the length of the lockdown period plus one month. This means that those with tourist visas that expired during the period of 23 March to 11 May, you will need to renew your visa, request an extension, or depart from Colombia before 11 June. There will be no penalty for not renewing your visa if it expired during these dates. For more information, visit the Migración Colombia website.

If you present symptoms in Colombia, you should contact your health care provider or call the national health line for coronavirus in your area.
