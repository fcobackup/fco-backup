The New Zealand Government has announced temporary restrictions on travellers in response to coronavirus (COVID-19).
As of 2359 local time on 19 March 2020, most foreign travellers can no longer enter New Zealand.
New Zealand citizens, permanent residents, residents with valid travel conditions, and their immediate family (partner or spouse, legal guardian, and dependent children under the age of 24) travelling with the New Zealand citizen can still come to New Zealand.
The New Zealand Government has announced, with strict health and onward flight criteria, the ability for travellers to transit New Zealand; this ability to transit may change at short notice and is only available for a short period. More information on this is available from Immigration New Zealand. We will share further information on the British High Commission’s Facebook and Twitter sites when available.
Returning residents and citizens will be required isolate themselves for 14 days upon arrival.
On 21 March 2020, the New Zealand Government introduced a four-level national COVID-19 alert response (see announcement here). The Government initially moved to COVID-19 Alert Level 2 – “Reduce Contact”. On 23 March 2020, the Government announced that with immediate effect New Zealand would move to COVID-19 Alert Level 3 for 48 hours. New Zealand will move to COVID-19 Alert Level 4 from the afternoon of 25 March 2020 (see announcement here) and for an initial four week period:
Level 3 response measures instruct limited travel in areas with clusters or community transmission, mass gatherings cancelled, public venues closed (e.g. libraries, museums, cinemas), and alternative ways of working required.
Level 4 response measures instruct people to stay at home, and sees educational facilities close, travel severely restricted, and businesses close except for essential services (e.g. supermarkets, pharmacies, clinics) and lifeline utilities.
