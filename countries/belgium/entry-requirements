Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s address for the latest information.

The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, on 20 March, the Belgian Interior Minister announced the reintroduction of entry and exit checks on the Belgian border, in order to prevent non-essential travel. The Ministry of the Interior has indicated that all travellers to Belgium will be expected to produce either a Belgian ID (residence) card or a letter from their employer to prove that their travel is essential. Those who are transiting through Belgium should carry valid ID/proof of residence and evidence of onward travel. Those who are attempting to travel for non-essential reasons will not be granted entry.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Belgium. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Belgium guide and contact the Belgian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Belgium.
