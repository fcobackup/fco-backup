Travel to the airport
You will need to arrange your own travel to the airport. Due to government restrictions, public transport is limited, and the authorities have discouraged all non-essential use of public transport. If you are travelling to Islamabad you should, if possible, carry printed copies of your flight confirmation and have your passports easily to hand. If you cannot get a printed flight confirmation, carry an electronic copy.
Provincial and federal authorities have stated that you will be able to travel to the airport if you have a confirmed flight ticket and valid travel document. Some provinces have limited the number of people that can be in a vehicle. In addition, people who do not have a flight ticket, except the driver, may not be allowed to accompany travellers to the airport.
If you have been placed into a quarantine centre, or you are in an area that has been quarantined by the authorities, you may have to wait until the quarantine is lifted before you can travel to the airport. Follow the advice of the relevant local authorities. If you are not allowed to travel across a checkpoint or if you are moved to a quarantine facility, call the British High Commission on 051 201 2000.
You are strongly advised not to travel to the airport if you are displaying any COVID-19 symptoms, including a high temperature. When you enter the airport, you will be thermal scanned by the Pakistani authorities. If you have a high temperature or other COVID-19 symptoms, you will not be permitted to fly. The Pakistan government are likely to take you to a quarantine facility, where you will be tested for COVID-19. If you test positive, you will likely remain in quarantine or be moved to a hospital isolation facility. If you test negative, you will be released with instructions to self-isolate for 14 days. Call us on 051 201 2000 if you are moved to a quarantine facility.
