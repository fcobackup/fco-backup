Volcanoes
There are numerous volcanoes in the Philippines, any of which can erupt without warning. Sudden steam and ash explosions may occur at any time. Check news reports and follow local advice before travelling to volcanic areas. Avoid volcanic areas during and immediately after heavy rainfall when there’s increased risk of lava flows. You can find more information about volcanoes on the Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) website.
On 9 April, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) lowered the alert status of Taal volcano to Alert Level 2 following decreasing activity at the site. PHIVOLCS continues to remind the general public that entry into Taal Volcano Island and Taal’s Permanent Danger Zone remains prohibited. You should follow updates on the PhiVolcs official website.
Ash plumes can affect air quality and have an impact on health. A properly fitted face mask may provide some protection. If you have any pre-existing respiratory conditions, you might be at increased risk of triggering or worsening your symptoms. Additional advice on the potential health hazards can found on the International Volcanic Health Hazard Network website .
The capacity of the Philippine emergency and rescue services to deal with large natural disasters is limited.
