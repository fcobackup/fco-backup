Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Malaysia.

Before you travel check that:

This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 999 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks  
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Malaysia
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Malaysia, including:
malaria
dengue
rabies in the states of Perlis, Kedah, Penang and Sarawak
Altitude sickness is a risk in parts of Malaysia, including Mount Kinabalu in eastern Malaysia (Malaysian Borneo). Read more about altitude sickness on TravelHealthPro.
Air pollution
High levels of air pollution in major towns and cities in Malaysia may make respiratory conditions worse.
