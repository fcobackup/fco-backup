Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Iceland. The authorities have introduced measures to limit the spread of the virus.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Travel restrictions
The Icelandic authorities have announced that from 19 March all Icelandic nationals and residents returning from any country abroad must self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. For now this restriction does not apply to non-residents. You can find further information from the Icelandic authorities at Covid19.is (available in English).
We are advising British people against all but essential travel worldwide due to unprecedented international border closures and other restrictions.
As of 17 March airlines are still operating between Iceland and the UK. However, you should keep up to date with your flight operator for any changes to their scheduled service.
If you decide to leave Iceland earlier than intended, then contact your airline or travel company and your insurance provider as soon as you are able.
Local measures
As of 16 March 2020, for four weeks, public gatherings of 100 people or more are restricted. This includes tourist attractions, museums, swimming pools and shopping centres.
The Icelandic Directorate of Health (Landlæknir) website has a dedicated English language page providing updates and guidance. There’s also a coronavirus hotline on +354 544-4113 if you believe you have been infected.

Further advice is available at Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
