This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Dominican Republic set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
COVID-19 Testing
Passengers arriving from the UK, or who have spent time in the UK in the preceding 14 days, must present a negative COVID-19 PCR or Antigen test taken no more than 72 hours before their arrival, or a vaccination card showing two doses of the COVID vaccine, with the last dose taken at least two weeks before travel.
Passengers under the age of seven years old are exempt from presenting a negative COVID-19 PCR or Antigen test.
Similar requirements apply to a number of countries. If you have been in a third country in the 14 days before travel, or are travelling to the Dominican Republic through another country, please check the official Dominican government website for a full list of COVID entry requirements from other countries.
All passengers will have their temperature tested. The Dominican authorities will administer a rapid diagnostic breath test to a percentage of randomly-selected passengers on arrival. Passengers showing COVID-19 symptoms will also be tested. Passengers may also be subject to a COVID-19 PCR test. If a passenger tests positive for COVID-19, they will be required to isolate in an authorised location. Travellers who have a negative COVID-19 PCR, taken in the 72 hours before arrival, or a vaccination card demonstrating a final dose administered no fewer than three weeks before their arrival, are exempt from these random tests.
You should comply with additional screening and other social distancing measures put in place by the authorities and follow instructions from the airport authorities.
These regulations may be subject to change at short notice and you should check with your travel provider before your journey. Further updates will be published when they are available.
Data collection
You will need to fill in a COVID Traveller’s Health Affidavit before travel to the Dominican Republic, to confirm whether you have any coronavirus symptoms and provide your contact details. This is part of an online form, which includes the COVID Traveller’s Health Affidavit, the Customs Declaration and the International Boarding / Disembarking forms and can be completed via the Dominican Republic’s Electronic Ticket Portal, before your journey.
For further information please check the Dominican Republic Travel Center website.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British Citizens travelling to the Dominican Republic for tourism don’t need a visa.
As of April 2018, the tourism entry tax (previously known as a tourist card) is no longer collected upon arrival and should be included in your air fare. Contact your airline or tour operator if you’re unsure whether you have already paid this fee. The Dominican Republic Embassy website has more information.
On arrival you will normally be granted a 30-day stay. This can be extended to 120 days by paying for an extension when you leave the country. This can be done online at the Dominican Directorate General for Migration website or at the airport on departure. If you’re planning to stay for longer, seek advice from a local lawyer or contact the local Immigration authorities.
As a foreign national you will be required to give your fingerprints and have a photograph taken in order to enter the Dominican Republic.
You must carry a photocopy of your identification (such as a passport), a copy of your entry stamp and proof of onward or return travel at all times, so that you can produce them if you’re asked to do so by the authorities.
Customs Declaration
All passengers arriving in or departing the Dominican Republic must fill in an online form, which includes the COVID Traveller’s Health Affidavit, the Customs Declaration and the International Boarding / Disembarking forms. The form can be completed via the Dominican Republic’s Electronic Ticket Portal, before your journey.
From 1 April 2021 the digital forms are mandatory. For further information, visit Viajero Digital.
Proof of onward or return travel
You may be refused entry if you don’t have proof of onward or return travel.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum of 6 months from the date of entry into the Dominican Republic.
However, from 1 January 2022 until 31 July 2022, tourists can enter the Dominican Republic with a passport with less than 6 months validity, providing it is valid for the full proposed duration of your stay.
Departure tax
Departure tax is US$20. Scheduled airlines include this charge in the price of the ticket. Check with your tour operator or travel provider.
Travelling with children
According to the Dominican Republic authorities, visitors under 18 travelling to the Dominican Republic don’t need written authorisation from their parents as long as they enter and leave with the same person or people. If visitors between the ages of 13 and 18 are travelling alone, or in a group with no one over 18, then parental authorisation is not required as long as the group remains the same on entry and exit.
Otherwise, a visitor under the age of 18 must carry a sworn affidavit drawn up by a solicitor and signed by the child’s parents or legal guardian(s) authorising their travel. The affidavit will need to be legalised by the  Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and the Dominican Republic Embassy   
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency travel documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from the Dominican Republic. Any travel document must have at least 6 months’ validity remaining to enter the Dominican Republic.
