At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
The Liberian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. This includes screening measures and travel restrictions for visitors, depending on which countries you have been to (including the UK). See Entry Requirements for travel restrictions.
As of 22 March, Liberian authorities have introduced wide-ranging social distancing and preventative measures for 21 days. Security forces will enforce measures. Measures include mandatory hand washing with soap and clean water at all premises, limits on gatherings and numbers of persons allowed in public premises at any one time. You should adhere to all rules and seek information from local authorities. Details could change and further restrictions be imposed.
Liberian authorities also discourage travel within and outside Montserrado and Margibi counties and have advised community members to report those showing coronavirus symptoms (coughing, fever, and difficulty breathing) by calling 4455.
There is a high risk for British nationals of being put into 14 days of quarantine, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. Liberian quarantine centres are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards. You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate for 14 days even after you have arrived in Liberia, if you either develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.
All travellers arriving in Liberia will be screened for the coronavirus. On arrival at Roberts International Airport or other entry points, staff will check your temperature and you must wash your hands with soap and water. You may be taken to quarantine. See Entry Requirements
Hand washing is also required before entering any government buildings, as well as many offices and local businesses. Some may also require temperature checks.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
Other health risks
Malaria is a serious problem throughout Liberia, including in Monrovia.
There have been previous outbreaks of Ebola in the country. Further information on Ebola can be found on the WHO website.
There is a risk of Lassa fever in Liberia and there have been confirmed cases in 2019. For more information on Lassa fever, you should visit the NaTHNaC website. If you’re concerned that you might have been exposed to, or are showing symptoms of Lassa Fever, you should seek immediate medical advice.
The 2012 UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic estimated that around 18,000 adults aged 15 or over in Liberia were living with HIV; the prevalence percentage was estimated at around 0.9% of the adult population compared to the prevalence percentage in adults in the UK of around 0.25%.  You should exercise normal precautions to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS.
Local medical care
Hospitals and medical facilities throughout Liberia are poorly equipped. There are no emergency services. Blood supplies are unreliable and unsafe, and medication is scarce. There is no effective public or commercial accident and emergency or ambulance service anywhere in the country. You should carry basic medical supplies. Ensure you have adequate supplies of prescription medication, bearing in mind the risk of delays due to flight cancellations. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, medical evacuation and repatriation.
