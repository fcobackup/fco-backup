Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Uganda.
Entry and borders
Since the 22 March, all international flights to and from Uganda have been suspended. Cargo flights are permitted, but crew must observe strict guidelines. Land borders and lake ports are also closed, except for truck drivers and a crew of up to three people. We continue to work with the Government of Uganda, other Embassies and airlines to determine options for helping British Nationals who wish to return home. However, you should not expect any additional flights immediately. See Return to the UK.
Given the rapidly changing situation in Uganda, we are temporarily withdrawing a limited number of UK staff and their dependents from our High Commission in Kampala. The High Commission will continue to carry out essential work including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Uganda.
