Crime
Levels of crime, especially in the capital Niamey, are high. Thefts, robberies and residential break-ins can occur at any time. The main type of incident for which British nationals need consular assistance in Niger is theft. Take sensible precautions to keep important items like money, passports, jewellery and mobile phones safe. The areas around the Gaweye Hotel, National Museum and Petit Marché in Niamey are particularly prone to muggings and you should not walk alone there, or cross the bridges over the River Niger on foot at any time. Be vigilant when walking anywhere in the city. Walking at night is dangerous due to the lack of street lighting.
There have been incidents of people, including westerners, being attacked when leaving banks and ATMs. Remain vigilant when withdrawing money or exiting banks; avoid doing so at night and avoid establishing a pattern of when and where you withdraw money. Exercise caution when using ATMs on the street and consider using ATMs available in most large hotels.
Car thieves often target off-road vehicles. Make sure car doors are locked at all times.
Banditry, smuggling and other criminal activity is common in border areas (particularly Maradi, Tillabéri and Diffa), especially after dark. You should take special care and avoid crossing borders during the hours of darkness.
There have also been incidents of Nigeriens being killed in the course of hold-ups and robberies on public transport buses travelling between Tahoua and Agadez and between Agadez and Arlit.
Scams
British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scams. The scams come in many forms: romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities, and can pose great financial risk to victims. You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.
Local travel
Travel around Niger can be difficult, and conditions are poor for overland travel. You should take all necessary safety precautions, especially outside of main urban areas, have confidence in your security arrangements and maintain a high level of vigilance.
Avoid all travel between towns at night. Seek local advice and use local travel agents and guides when travelling outside main towns and in desert areas. An approved local travel agent can arrange all the necessary permits for your journey and leave details of your itinerary with the local authorities. Travel in convoy and carry an independent satellite phone when travelling off the beaten track. You should prepare well in advance and make sure you have a sufficient supply of drinking water and food.
Northern and eastern Niger
Local authorities are extremely sensitive about foreigners travelling out of Tahoua to other parts of Niger in the east and the north.
The following roads in northern Niger are permanently closed to tourists, except with special authorisation:
Chirfa (Djado) / Djanet (Algeria)
Achouloma (north Djado) / Salvador Pass (Libya)
Adrar Bous (north Aïr) / Djanet (Algeria)
Adrar Bous (north Aïr) / In Azawa (Algeria)
Agadez / Arlit / Iferouane
Agadez / Tahoua
The MNJ armed group has launched attacks in the north including the use of land mines, and Islamist terrorist groups have previously launched attacks in Agadez, Arlit and against a prison in Niamey. Attacks against tourists are known to take place at El Meki between Agadez and Timia. The Aïr and Ténéré regions are particularly prone to attacks.
A curfew has been implemented in the whole of the Diffa region since 2014. As of 19 April 2019, this prohibits the movement of motorised vehicles from 8pm to 6am. There is also a general curfew from 10pm and 6am.
Western Niger
A state of emergency has been in place in the urban municipality of Tillabéri since February 2019. The movement of motorcycles and cars is banned from 7pm to 6am, and the movement of pedestrians is banned from 10pm to 6am. Public meetings are banned, unless expressly permitted by the authorities. Defence and security forces are authorised to carry out searches, and to check identities, both day and night.
Following an incident on 9 August 2020 which killed six French nationals and 2 Nigeriens in Kouré, Tillabéri, a state of emergency is in place for the whole of Tillabéri apart from Niamey.
A state of emergency has also been in place in Ouallam, Ayorou, Bankilare, Abala and Banibongou (Tillabéri region) and Tassara and Tillia (Tahoua region) since March 2017.
Southern Niger
A state of emergency is in place in the states of Borno and Yobe in Nigeria, which border Niger. The border areas of the Maradi region are increasingly prone to banditry. Kidnap for Ransom and theft are particularly common.
In October 2020 an American was kidnapped (and later rescued in a US military operation in Nigeria) in Massalata near the border with Nigeria.
Road travel
You can drive in Niger using an International Driving Permit (IDP) for up to 3 months. If you’re staying longer than 3 months, you will need to get a Niger licence.
If you’re driving on an IDP, you should have the 1968 version IDP to drive in Niger. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in Niger. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
You should carry car registration documents with you at all times.
The main roads between Niamey and other large towns are generally satisfactory by African standards, but some roads are pot-holed, conditions are often worse during and just after rainy season. Driving standards are poor. Vehicles are often poorly lit at night and there is little street lighting. There have been reports of land mines being used in Burkina Faso on the road between Ouagadougou and Niamey. Seek local advice before making this journey.
Buses operate on routes between Niamey and other large towns, but distances are long and buses are prone to mechanical failure. There have also been incidents of Nigeriens being killed in the course of hold-ups and robberies on public transport buses travelling between Tahoua and Agadez and between Agadez and Arlit.
Taxis are available but are often in poor mechanical condition. Driving standards are poor.
You should avoid public transport where possible, including buses (usually connecting towns) and taxis.
In the case of an accident, you should go immediately to the nearest police station to file a report. Crowds can gather quickly and you may be vulnerable if you remain at the scene. Medical help in the event of an accident is likely to be limited.
Political situation
As of 2 April 2021, the President of Niger is His Excellency Mohamed Bazoum, of the PNDS political party. Presidential security is taken very seriously. You should not approach the Presidential convoy and should avoid taking pictures or opening windows to look out when the President is passing.
Protests, marches and demonstrations can occur with little prior notice and can be violent. If you become aware of any nearby protests, marches or demonstrations, you should move away from the area immediately, as the atmosphere can change quickly and without warning.
Niger has contributed troops to the UN Peacekeeping Mission (MINUSMA) in neighbouring Mali and is committing troops to the regional fight against Boko Haram.
