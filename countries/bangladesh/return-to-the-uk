China Southern and US Bangla airlines are still operating flights to China, but these are for Chinese nationals only.

The British High Commission Dhaka is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest information for British nationals wishing to leave Bangladesh.
If you cannot leave Bangladesh at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus. You will need to be ready to comply with local isolation, testing or quarantine requirements.
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs. Given that many restrictions remain in place and continue to be introduced, moving within Bangladesh may become more difficult. Unless you have an urgent reason to travel within Bangladesh, you may have to stay where you are while the flight ban and lockdowns remain in place.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well.
