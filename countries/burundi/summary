Burundi will hold a referendum on constitutional change on 17 May 2018.

Armed security forces will have an increased presence particularly in the capital Bujumbura.
Burundi has experienced political instability since President Nkrunziza was inaugurated for a controversial third term in August 2015. There have been violent incidents reported across the country, including a number of targeted political and military assassinations. You should limit your movements, avoid large gatherings and remain vigilant at all times.
In Bujumbura you should avoid areas which have experienced violence. In particular. Kanyosha, Musaga, Mutakura, Kamenge, Cibitoke, Bwiza, Ngagara, Nyakabiga, Gatumba and Bujumbura-rural.
Avoid travelling by road outside Bujumbura after dark. This is due to the security situation and road safety concerns. See Local travel
