Laws and customs are very different from those in the UK. Be aware of your actions to ensure that they don’t offend. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with, and respect local laws and customs.
Shopping, food and drink all have any tax included in the price. Tipping isn’t expected.
Maximum penalties for possession or importation of even small quantities of drugs are severe, including deportation or imprisonment.
Plug sockets and plugs are the same as in Australia and New Zealand. Sometimes the plug has only two pins with no earth (otherwise described as “ungrounded”).
Homosexuality is illegal in Cook Islands and the laws are occasionally enforced, but is not illegal in Tokelau or Niue. Homosexuality is generally accepted within society and a laissez faire attitude is taken to tourists. However, public displays of affection would be considered offensive. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
