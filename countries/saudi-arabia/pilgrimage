On 22 June 2020, the Saudi authorities announced that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, pilgrims from outside the Kingdom would not be permitted to enter Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj in 2020. Hajj rites were only performed by a very limited number of pilgrims who already reside in the Kingdom. The Saudi authorities have gradually allowed pilgrims to perform Umrah at limited capacity. British nationals resident in Saudi Arabia can apply to perform Umrah through the official Ministry of Hajj app ‘Eatmarna’ and also ‘Tawakkalna’. Details of the process can be found on the official Ministry of Hajj Twitter page.
The approximate dates for the 2021 Hajj are 17 to 22 July. British citizens wishing to perform Umrah or Hajj should follow announcements on FCDO official social media channels @ukinsaudiarabia and guidance from local authorities.
Before you travel for pilgrimage, you should carefully consider the information and advice on the website of the Saudi Arabia Embassy in London, and in the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s (NaTHNaC) factsheet.
