Vilnius hosts a NATO Summit on the 11-12 July.
During the Summit, restrictions on vehicles, bicycles, e-scooters and pedestrians will be in place:
in Vilnius Old Town,
in the vicinity of the Lithuanian Exhibition and Congress Centre (LITEXPO),
in the territory of Vilnius Airport
and in some areas of the Naujamiestis elderships.
There will be a heightened security presence during the Summit and the days before. You should follow local restrictions and the directions of local law enforcement.
Further information is available on the Vilnius Municipality Summit website.
Crime
There have been reports of petty theft and robbery. Beware of pickpockets, avoid unlit streets and parks at night, and be extra vigilant if you’re walking alone. Take extra care of your belongings in busy locations and on public transport. Don’t leave coats and handbags unattended in bars, pubs and clubs.
Don’t leave drinks unattended and be wary of accepting food and drink from strangers in bars, nightclubs and restaurants.
Car theft is a problem in certain areas. Lock unattended vehicles and hide contents. Use guarded car parks in cities, especially overnight.
 
There have been a number of thefts of bicycles in Vilnius.
In an emergency or if you wish to report a crime, call the police on 112.
Local travel
From 12pm 11 July until 2pm 12 July (EEST/GMT+3), all flights will be prohibited in Vilnius airspace.
Air traffic disruptions and delays are also possible before, during and after the Summit due to higher than normal aircraft traffic at Vilnius and Kaunas airports.
Between 7 and 13 July, small aircraft, balloons and drones will be prohibited.
Public transport
It is not always possible to buy tickets on local buses and or trolley-buses so it is advisable to purchase tickets in advance. More information on e-tickets and pre-charged travel cards is available at Getting around Vilnius.
Taxis are reasonably priced. Make sure the meter is used. It is cheaper and safer to use a recognised taxi app, or phone for a taxi from a recognised company than to hail one in the street. Ask your hotel reception to call one. Do not use unregistered taxis.
Klaipeda, Nida and Palanga
If you intend to walk along the Curonian Spit be aware that after a short distance the Spit forms part of Kaliningrad, which is a territory of the Russian Federation.
