At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Cholera, malaria, dengue fever and other insect-borne infections occur in Kenya. You should take precautions to avoid being bitten by insects.
On 1 August 2018, an outbreak of Ebola was declared in Béni territory, North Kivu Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Kenyan authorities have put in place additional screening measures at some airports and border crossings in Kenya for those arriving from affected areas. The latest updates can be found on the WHO website.
You should drink or use only boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks. Don’t eat food prepared by unlicensed vendors. See food and water hygiene.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, first deal with the emergency with first aid skills if possible and then move onto the nearest, largest Accident and Emergency department. In Nairobi this is either Nairobi Hospital or the Aga Khan University Hospital.
Due to a current cluster of cases of cholera at the Nairobi Hospital in April 2019, you should consider the need for urgent treatment and use the Nairobi Hospital if travelling to other emergency departments would cause delay in reaching appropriate medical care. See the National Travel Health Network and Centre website for further information.
