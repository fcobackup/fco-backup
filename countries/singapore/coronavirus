If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

Public spaces and services
Face masks
From 29 August 2022 face masks will only be compulsory on public transport, in care homes and inside healthcare facilities, including dentists and clinics. Facemasks will remain required in the queuing areas to board public transport, such as on train platforms and in bus queues, but will not be required inside airports, taxis and privately hired buses. At healthcare facilities all indoor locations, including shops and restaurants contained inside, require masks to be worn at all times, except when eating or drinking. Children under 6 years old do not need to wear masks. You could be fined, imprisoned, or both if you are found not wearing a face mask when it is required.
The Health Sciences Authority’s guide on face masks recommends that masks have at least 2 to 3 layers of fabric.
Trace Together and Health Alerts via SMS
You’ll need to be fully vaccinated to dine out and will need to show proof of vaccination status on the TraceTogether phone app or token to attend an event or activity with more than 500 people and to enter some nightlife venues.
Short term foreign visitors are asked to download the TraceTogether app on their phones and activate it while in Singapore. Mobile phones and/or local tourist SIM cards can be rented/purchased at Changi Airport to enable visitors to do so.
TraceTogether tokens can be rented for children aged 7-12 or those with disabilities. See the TraceTogether for Travellers page.
Vaccination status
To dine out, attend an event with more than 500 people and enter some nightlife venues anyone over 12 years old must be recognised as fully vaccinated by the Singapore government’s definition. You’re considered fully vaccinated 14 days after you’ve completed the required doses of any of these vaccines:
Pfizer
Moderna
AstraZeneca (also known as CoviShield)
Janssen (Johnson and Johnson)
Sinovac
Sinopharm
Covaxin
Novavax
Singapore’s Vaccine Booster Programme includes those 12 years old and above. If you are resident in Singapore, or have stayed in Singapore for over 30 days, and fail to get your first booster shot within 270 days after your final dose of the primary series you will lose your fully-vaccinated status. See section on booster shots.

If you are unvaccinated, you are not allowed to go into work at all.
Vaccination is required to obtain or renew a long-term pass, work pass or Permanent Residency.
Details on workplace matters are under Advisories on COVID-19 on the Ministry of Manpower website.
Healthcare in Singapore
