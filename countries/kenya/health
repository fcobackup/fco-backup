Coronavirus
Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Kenya. The Kenyan authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus:
The suspension of all international flights to and from Kenya from 23:59 (local time) on Wednesday 25 March. The exception being cargo flights whose crew must observe strict guidelines.
All individuals who enter Kenya, from 22 March, must undergo mandatory quarantine for 14 days at government designated facilities at their own expense.
From midnight on 22 March, all bars will remain closed until further notice. Restaurants will be open to operate ‘takeaway’ services only. The Government has directed public places to set a maximum capacity to conform to social distance requirements of at least 1.5 meters. You can also expect shops, supermarkets and public transport systems to implement measures to ensure social distancing.
The Government of Kenya has also mandated that any person who has entered Kenya from a country with reported coronavirus cases since 1 March 2020, including the UK, must self-quarantine for 14 days or until they have been symptom-free for 14 days from the time of entry into Kenya.
The government of Kenya are conducting random temperature screenings in spaces frequented by the general public. If you show signs or symptoms of Coronavirus and are able to self-isolate, you can expect to be directed to do so. If you show signs or symptoms of Coronavirus and self-isolating is not an option available to you, you can expect to be taken into a State health facility by the Kenyan authorities.
Foreigners, including British nationals, can break their self-quarantine before 14 days only if asymptomatic and only to depart Kenya immediately, before international flights are suspended.
Guidance on self-quarantining and self-isolation from Public Health England is available here.
The government has banned all meetings, conferences and events of an international nature in Kenya. It has advised its citizens to avoid crowded places and to work remotely where possible.
For more details, see the Kenya Ministry of Health website.
You should comply with all measures put in place by the Kenyan authorities.
British nationals should contact their tour operator or airline for the latest information on any possible disruptions, cancellations or reduction of flight services, in advance of the suspension of international flights.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Kenyan embassy/high commission/consulate.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Medical treatment
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, first deal with the emergency with first aid skills if possible and then move onto the nearest, largest Accident and Emergency department. In Nairobi this is either Nairobi Hospital or the Aga Khan University Hospital.
Other health risks
Cholera, malaria, dengue fever and other insect-borne infections occur in Kenya. You should take precautions to avoid being bitten by insects.
On 1 August 2018, an outbreak of Ebola was declared in Béni territory, North Kivu Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo. On 11 June 2019, the Ugandan government confirmed an outbreak of Ebola in Kasese District in western Uganda. Kenyan authorities have put in place additional screening measures at some airports and border crossings in Kenya for those arriving from affected areas. The latest updates can be found on the WHO website. If travelling in the region, you should check FCO Travel Advice for the relevant countries.
You should drink or use only boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks. Don’t eat food prepared by unlicensed vendors. See food and water hygiene.
