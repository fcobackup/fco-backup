Travel in Luxembourg
In response to a sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Luxembourg, additional measures have been put in place to limit the spread of the virus.
You must wear a face covering and observe the standard social distancing requirement when travelling through Luxembourg Airport (Findel). Your mask should not be removed during security control. Hand sanitiser is available throughout the terminal where hand washing is unavailable.
Face coverings must be worn on public transport and in all indoor areas open to the public and where the public is circulating.
Breaches of regulations can result in fines of up to €1000.
Accommodation
Hotel and guesthouse bars and restaurants are now open to the public under the same conditions as all other restaurants, bars and cafes (see below). Face coverings must be worn in public areas, and where the social distancing requirement cannot be met.
Public spaces and services
Face coverings must be worn in shops, supermarkets, exhibitions, and other places that are open to the public.
The Luxembourg government has shortened the curfew, and people are now required to remain at home from midnight to 6am. Outings during these hours are only permitted in certain specified circumstances; these can be accessed with further details on the Luxembourg government website.
Restaurants and bars are open for service both indoors and outdoors between 6am-10pm under strict measures. Only four people will be permitted to sit at each table, unless they are from the same household, and tables will need to be 1.5 metres apart, or separated by a barrier. All customers seated indoors and over the age of six years must:
present a negative PCR test carried out less than 72 hours before access; or
present a negative rapid antigen test carried out less than 24 hours and certified by a health professional, civil servant or public employee designated for this purpose by the Director of Health; or
present a negative antigen self-test performed on site.
Anyone refusing to present a negative test result or take a test will be unable to be seated indoors.
Outdoor spaces and terraces must be open on three sides. Take-away, drive-through and home delivery services remain available. Other restrictions include limiting the additional number of people allowed at gatherings at home or private events to a maximum of two visitors, who must be from the same household. Gatherings of 4 to 10 people in a public space are allowed, subject to the wearing of a mask. With some exceptions, gatherings of between 11 - 150 people are allowed on condition that people are assigned seating, observe 2 metres social distancing and wear a mask. Events of more than 150 people and up to a maximum of 1000 are subject to agreement in advance by the Health Directorate.
The consumption of alcohol outdoors is prohibited.
Cinemas, theatres and cultural events are open.
Shops, hairdressers and beauticians are open. Indoor sports facilities, gyms, swimming pools and aquatic centres are open with strict hygiene restrictions in place.
