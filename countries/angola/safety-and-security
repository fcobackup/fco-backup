Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Angola.

This guide also has safety advice for regions of Angola. 
Terrorism  
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.      
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Angola 
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Angola, attacks cannot be ruled out.
Crime 
There is a high level of crime in Luanda, some of it violent. Muggers can be armed and some attacks have been fatal. If you are attacked, hand over your money and valuables immediately.  
Most international companies and organisations operating in Angola have security rules for staff. If your company has rules, read and follow them. 
Protecting yourself and your belongings 
Criminals target areas popular with foreigners. You should be particularly careful when withdrawing money from banks and ATMs, as you could be followed and robbed. 
You can reduce your personal risk by: 
using pre-arranged cars or hotel cars when withdrawing money 
not walking around in Luanda, especially not alone or after dark 
not wearing expensive-looking jewellery or watches or using a mobile in public places 
not walking between bars and restaurants on the Ilha do Cabo 
avoiding crowded places like markets and all large gatherings 
Put your valuables and cash in a hotel safe where practical. Keep a certified copy of your passport’s photo page in a separate place. 
Vehicle crime 
Theft from stationary or slow-moving cars is common in downtown Luanda. Keep valuables out of sight and do not use mobiles or laptops while in traffic. When driving, keep doors locked and windows closed. Do not respond if anyone signals you to pull over. Thieves may fake a minor traffic incident to get you out of your car. If they succeed, they may rob you and also steal the car. 
Sexual assault 
Incidents of rape have been reported in popular nightlife areas, as well as in private homes. Never travel alone at night.
Laws and cultural differences  
Personal ID 
Always carry ID – it is safest to carry a certified copy your passport’s photo page. If travelling outside of Luanda and the provincial capitals, take the originals with you, packed as securely as you can. If you do not have any ID, you may get an on-the-spot fine of 15,000 kwanzas. 
Illegal drugs and prison sentences 
Drug taking and smuggling are offences. Punishments can be severe and prison conditions are very poor. 
Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas 
Do not use cameras, binoculars or GPS equipment near any government buildings. Taking photographs in the streets can draw the attention of the authorities and they may confiscate your camera. 
LGBT+ travellers 
In January 2019, Angola’s parliament made it illegal to discriminate against people on the basis of sexual orientation. However, public attitudes towards same-sex relationships are less tolerant than in the UK. Showing affection in public may attract negative attention.
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs 
If you’re caught buying or trafficking goods made of ivory it’s likely you’ll be prosecuted and get a prison sentence or fine.
Transport risks  
Road travel  
If you are planning to drive in Angola, see information on driving abroad. To reduce the risk of breakdowns or accidents, use off-road vehicles for longer journeys. Outside major towns, foreign visitors usually travel in convoys of at least 2 vehicles for safety and in case of breakdowns. 
Although you can drive on a UK photocard licence for up to 30 days, it is helpful to get the 1949 version of the international driving permit (IDP) as well. Make sure you have your driving licence, IDP, and ownership and insurance documents in the car. You will need to show them at the frequent police checkpoints. 
Road conditions and landmines 
Roads outside Luanda and the provincial capitals are often in poor condition. Landmines and unexploded bombs and weapons are still a problem on roads, verges and bridges.  
During the rainy season from November to April there is an increased chance of mines shifting due to flooding and resurfacing outside known mine fields. 
There have been incidents where mines have exploded with loss of life in places previously thought to be safe. Even in ‘cleared’ areas, keep to well-established routes and take up-to-date advice from the United Nations or an international non-governmental organisation. 
Taxis and minibuses 
Book airport taxis in advance using your hotel or travel operator. In most cases your sponsor will arrange to meet you at the airport and to provide transport throughout your trip.  
For taxi travel in Angola, always use pre-booked taxis. You can book using apps, including ‘Yango’ and ‘Heetch’. Check the driver’s identity details match before getting in. Local minibus transport is unsafe.  
Air travel 
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in Angola that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to and from the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority.
Extreme weather and natural disasters 
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Flooding 
During the rainy season from November to April, there are storms and heavy downpours. This can cause sudden, serious flooding in and around cities, including Luanda. Flooding can damage roads, buildings and bridges. Stay indoors during storms.
