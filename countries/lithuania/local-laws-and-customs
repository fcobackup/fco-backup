Drugs
Donâ€™t become involved with drugs. Possession of even very small quantities can lead to imprisonment or heavy fines.
Taking food and drink into the EU
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions for medical reasons, for example certain amounts of powdered infant milk, infant food, or pet food required for medical reasons. Check the rules about taking food and drink into the EU on the European Commission website.
