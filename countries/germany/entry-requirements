The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Germany has intensified border controls at airports and land borders. Unless travellers are resident in Germany, can demonstrate a compelling reason for their travel to Germany, or are border workers commuting between Germany and neighbouring countries, they will be refused entry. Frontier workers and goods traffic are not currently affected.
If you intend to fly to Germany, check with your airline in advance and ensure you bring any supporting documents you need to justify your travel. If you are transiting through an airport in Germany in order to travel to the UK, you will need to have onward travel, and, if necessary, temporary accommodation booked before you will be permitted to enter Germany.
You should also ensure you are aware of your airline’s policy on protective measures on board flights; some carriers have made the wearing of face masks compulsory, for example.
If you’re living in Germany, you can return as long as your habitual place of residence is Germany and you can provide proof of this. Proof of residence might include:
certificate of registration of address (also available online)
payslip (with German address)
free movement certificate (not issued any longer)
other official documents evidencing residence in Germany
You should bear in mind that the situation is changing quickly and that border police in some regions may take a more strict approach.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior has detailed information on its website, including in English, regarding the rules on entry and exit from Germany.
