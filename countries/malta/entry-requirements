Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Malta
As of 15 July flights to and from some countries has been extended to include the UK on the Visit Malta website. All arriving passengers must have completed a paper copy of both a public health and a passenger locator form. These are available at the Malta Airport website or enquire with your airline.
As of midnight on Friday 21 August, passengers arriving from Romania, Bulgaria or certain regions of Spain will be required to submit a negative COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test before boarding flights to Malta. Passengers who do not present this certificate can be asked to give a swab on arrival at Malta International Airport or be asked to self-quarantine in Malta upon arrival. The Maltese Government will regularly review the list of countries for which prior testing will be required. The list can be found on the Malta Tourism website.
Self-isolation
As of 15 July the list of passengers from certain countries who are exempt from self-isolation has been expanded to include the UK. The current list of exempt countries can be found on the Visit Malta website. If arriving from one of these countries passengers will need to certify they have resided in that country for at least 2 weeks prior to travelling. There will, however, be temperature checks for all arriving and departing passengers. Those passengers with a high temperature will be required to undergo a swab test. Further details on the procedures are explained on the Malta International Airport website.
You may not travel to Malta from a country not listed via one of the listed countries. If you wish to travel to Malta from a country not listed you will need prior permission from the Maltese authorities. You should contact your nearest Maltese Embassy or High Commission for more information.
