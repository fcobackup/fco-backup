Political Situation
The political situation in Burkina Faso is evolving and you should remain vigilant and monitor local media. While the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office continues to monitor the situation, we have no British Embassy in country and are very limited in the assistance we can provide.
The FCDO continues to advise against all but essential travel to the capital Ouagadougou, up to the toll booths on all roads out of the city, and against all travel to the rest of Burkina Faso. If you are in Ouagadougou, exercise caution and avoid political rallies and gatherings, areas of demonstrations and protests. Crowds can gather quickly and may become violent. You should remain vigilant, and exercise caution when monitoring local announcements.
Crime
There is a risk of armed groups stopping vehicles (including public buses) on major roads to rob them, particularly at night.
Street crime poses high risks for visitors. Most incidents involve opportunist snatches of purses, wallets, jewellery and other valuables. Thieves are particularly active in crowds. The areas near and around the UN Circle and the former Central Market in Ouagadougou experience the highest amount of street crime. You should take sensible precautions. Do not carry valuables in public places or walk alone at night.
Scams
British nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms: romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities, and can pose great financial risk to victims.
You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.
Local travel
If you decide to travel outside of Ouagadougou against FCDO advice, you should avoid travel between towns by road at night, particularly from Bobo Dioulasso to Côte d’Ivoire, and Fada to Benin and Togo, due to a history of incidents in these areas.
Incidents are not confined to principal routes. Secondary roads (notably roads in the east to Benin, Bogande and Gayeri) are also affected.
You should also take care if you’re travelling by road between Burkina Faso and Niger. You should travel in convoy where possible and seek local advice before setting out. Where possible you should follow a police patrol.
Armed roadside banditry is a problem across the country, and the number of attacks is increasing. Drivers who have refused to stop for robbers have been shot at. Remote and border regions are particularly vulnerable but there have been attacks on the main road between Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.
Road travel
You can drive in Burkina Faso using a UK driving licence.
With a few exceptions, roads are poor with few street lights. There is a risk of banditry and hitting stray livestock. Road conditions off the main roads are often difficult, especially in the rainy season (June-September). Vehicles do not always have headlights and are often in poor condition.
Stay on clearly marked roads or tracks and avoid minor roads in remote areas unless travelling in convoy. If you break down off a main road you may not be able to attract help. Carry drinking water with you.
