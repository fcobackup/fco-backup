The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Zambia based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel to Zambia is subject to entry restrictions
All visitors and returning residents must have proof that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the 72 hours before their arrival in Zambia. There is no requirement for visitors or residents to self-isolate on arrival.
Temperature checking is routine on arrival. If your body temperature is 38 degrees Celsius or higher, or if you have COVID-19 symptoms, you will be tested for COVID-19 and will be quarantined at home or in a designated government facility until your test result is known.
All travellers wishing to leave Zambia to travel to a country that requires a negative COVID-19 test are required to produce a medical certificate stating that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the previous 14 days. This requirement does not apply to travellers to a destination that does not require a negative test but travellers are advised to check with their airline on their requirements prior to travel.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
