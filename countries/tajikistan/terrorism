Terrorists are likely to try to carry out further attacks in Tajikistan. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.
On 29 July 2018, 7 tourists from western countries were cycling near Dangara in southern Tajikistan when a local man drove into them. This was a deliberate attack. Four of the 7 cyclists were killed by the vehicle’s impact and wounds sustained in a subsequent knife attack carried out by the occupants of the car. This is the first incident of its kind in Tajikistan. While the motives are not clear, the terrorist group Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) claimed responsibility. In light of this incident, you should exercise extreme caution and vigilance, particularly if hiking or cycling in the countryside.
There’s a threat of kidnapping in Tajikistan. The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage-takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
