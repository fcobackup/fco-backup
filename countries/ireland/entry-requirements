The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Measures in response to coronavirus
Self-isolation on arrival
All arrivals from overseas, including Irish residents, are asked to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. This does not apply if you are returning to Ireland from Northern Ireland, transiting via an Irish airport on your way to another country, or in a specified category of essential supply chain workers such as aircrew, hauliers or maritime staff, whether Irish-based or foreign-based.
Passengers on air and sea routes into Ireland are asked to complete a health passenger locator form providing the address of where they will self-isolate for the next 14 days and contact details for follow up. Details of passengers’ state of health are not requested. Individuals may be subject to spot checks by telephone after arrival to verify their compliance with these requirements.
Regular entry requirements
ID
Ireland, along with the UK, is a member of the Common Travel Area. British nationals travelling from the UK don’t need a passport to visit Ireland. However, Irish immigration officers will check the ID of all passengers arriving by air from the UK and may ask for proof of nationality, particularly if you were born outside the UK. You are therefore advised to take your British passport with you.
For more information about the types of ID you might be asked to present, see the website of the Ireland Citizens Information Board.
Before travelling, check with your carrier about their ID requirements, as most airlines and other transport providers won’t carry passengers to and from Ireland unless they’ve seen satisfactory photographic ID.
Passport validity
If you’re using a passport to enter Ireland, it should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry into, transit through, and exit from Ireland.
