The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
Flights to Switzerland are subject to controls and inspections. Entry in to Switzerland via flights from the UK, Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and all non-Schengen countries will now only be possible for Swiss citizens, residents, cross-border workers, those transiting with an onward ticket within the same day (not overnight) and those with “compelling reasons”. Flights from Schengen countries, apart from Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, remain unaffected. Border crossings between Switzerland and Austria, France, Germany, and Italy are subject to controls and inspections. Entry into Switzerland via the border crossings with Austria, France, Germany and Italy will now only be possible for Swiss citizens, residents, cross-border workers, those transiting with an onward ticket within the same day (not overnight) and those with “compelling reasons”. Goods traffic is also still permitted. Secondary customs posts are closed at all borders so that traffic can be channelled through the main border crossings.
You will require a valid travel document to enter Switzerland.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
