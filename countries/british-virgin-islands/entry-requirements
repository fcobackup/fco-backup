Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to the British Virgin Islands
Entry by air to the Territory is only permitted through the T B Lettsome International Airport. A twice-daily ferry service from the USVI is operating to Road Town only.
Everyone entering the Territory will be subject to pre-approval and testing and quarantine protocols.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
If you live in England, the British Virgin Islands will accept the NHS app or your NHS letter to demonstrate your COVID-19 vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Testing / screening on arrival
Effective 15 May all travellers who have been fully vaccinated with the final dose administered at least 14 days before travel will be immediately released from quarantine once their arrival test is negative. However this does not apply to anyone travelling from or through India or Brazil.
Fully vaccinated travellers from all other countries will require:
BVI Gateway Traveller Authorisation Certificate at a cost of $105.00;
Proof of a negative RT-PCR COVID-19 test taken 3-5 days before arrival;
Proof of vaccination status;
RT-PCR COVID-19 testing upon arrival; and
Quarantine until the return of a negative test result
Where fully vaccinated persons are travelling with one or more unvaccinated child:
Children aged 5-17 will be tested on arrival;
Children will be released from quarantine together with their parents/guardians once the test results for the entire group are negative, but must remain within their family bubble; and
Unvaccinated children will be subject to a further test on day four
Additionally, a fully vaccinated traveller may be approved for home quarantine in a residence where all the adult occupants are fully vaccinated, once the traveller, or travelling party, is provided with a separate bedroom.
Partially vaccinated travellers (those that have received one dose of a two-dose vaccine, or whose final vaccine dose was administered less than two weeks before arriving in the Territory) will require:
BVI Gateway Traveller Authorisation Certificate at a cost of $175.00;
Proof of a negative RT-PCR COVID-19 test taken 3-5 days before arrival;
Proof of vaccination status;
RT-PCR COVID-19 negative test upon arrival;
A four day quarantine period and
RT-PCR COVID-19 negative test on day 4
Unvaccinated travellers will require:
BVI Gateway Traveller Authorisation Certificate at a cost of $175.00;
Proof of a negative RT-PCR COVID-19 test taken 3-5 days before arrival;
RT-PCR COVID-19 negative test upon arrival;
A seven day quarantine period and
RT-PCR COVID-19 negative test on day 7.
Where people are traveling in mixed groups with some individuals unvaccinated, the entire party will be treated as unvaccinated and will also be required to quarantine for seven days upon arrival.

All persons permitted to travel from India and Brazil (nationals, belongers, residents, work permit holders, persons permitted to reside in the territory, diplomats and persons employed by BVI Government and Statutory Agencies) will be subjected to the following testing and quarantine protocols:
All travellers will need approval prior to entry. This can be obtained through the online BVI Portal
A certified rt-PCR negative test within five days prior to arrival
Quarantine in an approved location for a period of 14 days
Tests on arrival, day 7 and day 14 and if all are negative be allowed full movement within the Territory
All arriving passengers will be issued with and required to wear a tracking bracelet
A charge of $175 per person will be collected from all passengers to cover the cost of in-Territory testing and the BVI Portal app.

Fully vaccinated persons who have been present in the Virgin Islands for more than 14 consecutive days and wish to travel to the US Virgin Islands, St. Maarten, or Puerto Rico for a period not longer than 24 hours. Outgoing ‘day trippers’ to these neighboring jurisdictions will be exempted from quarantine and the COVID-19 test upon re-entering the Territory; but would be required to take a PCR test seven days after returning to the Territory. A person certified as a day tripper should:
apply for re-entry through the Gateway prior to departure from the Virgin Islands;
pay a fee of $70.00
‘Day trippers’ are allowed to travel with children who are under five years old. Refusal by a returning ‘day tripper’ to undergo Day 7 testing will attract a fixed penalty of five thousand dollars or a court penalty of ten thousand dollars on summary conviction.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to visit the BVI. It’s normal practice for BVI immigration authorities to issue you with a one-month entry stamp on arrival. You may also be granted an extension for one further month. Extensions for up to 6 months are granted on the discretion of the Chief Immigration Officer provided that the individual can show proof of independent financial means. You may need to provide evidence of accommodation and your plans to leave the BVI at the end of your stay.
For all other immigration and labour matters, including work permits, contact the BVI authorities:

Passport validity
You must hold a valid passport to enter the BVI. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from the BVI.
If you’re travelling via the USA on an ETD, you will need to get a valid US visa.
As the BVI is a British Overseas Territory, there is no formal British diplomatic or consular representation. UK ETDs are processed by the British High Commission in Barbados.
Departure tax
There is a US$50 tax for all passengers, payable on leaving the BVI by air ($15 departure tax, $5 security charge departure tax and a US$30 airport development fee). This is generally included in the ticket price. If you’re departing the BVI by ferry, a departure tax of US$20 per person or US$15 for residents is payable.
Visitors arriving by air or sea are also charged an Environmental and Tourism levy of US$10 on arrival.
