The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Cyprus based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
The UK has been removed from Cyprus’ Category B List which means that temporary visitors (who are not citizens or residents of Cyprus) are not permitted to travel to Cyprus from the UK
Legal residents of Cyprus and Cypriot ID holders are permitted to enter Cyprus on presentation of proof of residence or Cypriot nationality
On 21 December, the Cypriot authorities publicly advised against all but essential travel to the UK from Cyprus, and a mandatory authority-assigned quarantine of a minimum of 7 days for all arrivals into Cyprus from the UK. Following this announcement, the authorities have informed the British High Commission, but not yet publicly announced, that the UK is now in Cyprus’ Category C. This means that visitors from the UK are not permitted to travel to Cyprus.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

There have been reports of an increase in holidaymakers being encouraged to submit a claim for personal injury if they have experienced gastric illness during their stay. You can find more information about the action you can take if you have suffered a personal injury on the Citizens Advice website. You should only consider pursuing a complaint or claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness; if you make a false or fraudulent claim, you may face legal proceedings in the UK or Cyprus.
If you need to contact the emergency services call 112.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
