Travel in Spain
The State of Emergency (“Estado de Alarma”), declared on 14 March in response to the coronavirus outbreak, ended on 21 June. Spain has now entered the ‘new normal’ phase of its de-escalation strategy.
Restrictions on movement throughout the country have been lifted and travel between regions is permitted.
A small number of local outbreaks of COVID-19 have been identified in Spain since the end of the State of Alarm. You should consult the Ministry of Health map for information on their locations. If you are staying in any of the affected areas, follow the advice of the local authorities.
Road travel
Land borders are open.
Inter-regional travel is permitted. If travelling with people who are not from the same household, all passengers must wear a face mask covering the nose and mouth. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply.

Local measures and the ‘new normal’ phase
On 21 June, Spain entered the ‘new normal’ phase, which concludes the progressive 4-phase de-escalation plan and sees the return of cross-regional mobility. Protective protocols and safety measures remain in place and you should observe the guidelines set out by the Spanish Government at all times. You should also refer to regional authorities for any additional local measures where you are as this may vary from one region to the next.
Key ‘new normal’ measures include:
social distancing of 1.5-metres.
obligatory use of face masks in public spaces (see ‘Use of facemasks’).
track and trace – all shops, businesses and transport companies are obliged to keep passengers’ contact information (where provided) for up to 4 weeks for tracking and tracing purposes.
abiding by any safety measures put in place by establishments such as hotels, bars, shops and restaurants to reduce the risk of COVID-19.
capacity restrictions in place at beaches such as the delineation of plots and the use of booking systems. You should refer to local authorities for information on the measures in place.
if visitors test positive or develop symptoms during their stay in Spain, they may be moved to specific designated accommodation to prevent further spread.
wash your hands frequently and thoroughly and use hand sanitizer gel where soap and water is not available.
Use of face masks
The use of face masks is obligatory to anyone over the age of 6 years old in all public spaces in Spain, where it is not possible to maintain social distancing of 1.5 metres. Face masks must cover the nose and mouth. Penalties may be imposed if you do not comply.
Those with respiratory problems or those unable to wear a mask due to other health conditions or disabilities are exempt from this rule. More details are available from the Ministry for Health (in Spanish).
While not mandatory, the use of face masks on children between 3 and 5 years of age is recommended.
