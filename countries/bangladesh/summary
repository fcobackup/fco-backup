Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Bangladesh. The threat extends across the country. There have been several IED (Improvised Explosive Device) attacks targeting police and security forces in Dhaka, Khulna, Chittagong and Sylhet.

You should minimise your exposure to these areas, consider your movements carefully and follow any specific advice of the local authorities. See Terrorism.
