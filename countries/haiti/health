Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Haiti.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 116 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccination recommendations for Haiti

Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Medicines sold in Haiti may be poor quality and pharmacies may sell expired medicines. Some medicines may not be available to buy in Haiti. You should bring enough essential medicines, especially for specific medical conditions like diabetes.

The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare in Haiti
Medical services are extremely limited, easily overwhelmed and offer a poor standard of care.
Emergency response is not guaranteed as there are not enough ambulances and they may not have basic medical supplies. Many people rely on private healthcare and ambulance services. Check with your travel insurance provider if these services are covered.
If you have a life-threatening emergency you may need to pay for evacuation by air ambulance, which can be very expensive.
Doctors and hospitals generally expect immediate cash payment for care even if you have a proof of a valid travel health insurance. You will have to pay the full amount for your treatment before leaving the hospital.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Haiti where some staff will speak English.
