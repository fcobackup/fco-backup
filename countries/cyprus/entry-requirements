The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
From 15 March, UK nationals (and other non-Cypriots) are not permitted to enter the Republic of Cyprus for tourism while a state of emergency is in force.
Some Cypriot nationals and other legal residents are being allowed to enter the Republic for urgent medical needs or repatriation of the most vulnerable. This includes some British residents of Cyprus. Further advice can be obtained from Cyprus’ High Commissions, Consulates or Embassies abroad.
Individuals falling into the above categories will be expected to obtain a certificate from Cyprus’ diplomatic missions abroad in order to gain permission to travel and will be subject to 14 days’ quarantine in a state facility on arrival.
There is a near complete ban on flights to and from the Republic of Cyprus until 28 May. Although some commercial flights are still able to leave Cyprus, only humanitarian and cargo flights may arrive. The Cyprus government is organising repatriation flights from European hubs. See Return to the UK for details
The administration in the north of Cyprus has introduced a total ban on entry for all foreign nationals, including from the UK, until 15 May. This includes those holding residency, work, or student permits. Exemptions exist for spouses and children of ‘citizens’ of north Cyprus, regardless of whether they are ‘citizens’ themselves.
Anyone returning to north Cyprus from abroad will be quarantined for 14 days in centres organised by the administration. There are currently no flights between Turkey and the north of Cyprus until at least 28 May.
Neighbouring countries including Greece and Turkey have also introduced restrictions which may impact on travel. Check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details.
