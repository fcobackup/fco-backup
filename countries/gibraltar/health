Most medical problems can be dealt with locally. The main hospital is St Bernardâ€™s at Europort (telephone: +350 200 79700).
If you are a British national living in the UK you can get emergency treatment in Gibraltar by presenting your UK passport. However, as some emergency treatment may require transfer to Spain, you should get a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) before leaving the UK. The EHIC is not a substitute for medical and travel insurance, but entitles you to emergency medical treatment on the same terms as Spanish nationals. You will not be covered for medical repatriation, on-going medical treatment or non-urgent treatment.
