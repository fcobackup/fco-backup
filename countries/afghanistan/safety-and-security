If you choose to travel to or stay in Afghanistan against FCDO advice, you should monitor media reporting and make sure you have robust contingency plans in place. Be vigilant at all times, keep others informed including family and friends of your travel plans and vary your routes and routines.
There is a heightened risk that foreign nationals including British nationals could be detained in Afghanistan. If you’re a British national and you are subsequently detained in Afghanistan, the FCDO’s ability to provide consular support is extremely limited. The FCDO’s ability to secure information from the authorities could also be severely limited and communications with family or next of kin may not be guaranteed.
There are no formal rule of law structures or processes in place in Afghanistan, and foreign nationals have been detained without due process. You should pay close attention to local information and customs and avoid any activity that is likely to raise suspicion.
Political situation
Afghanistan is now under Taliban control. The political situation remains uncertain and could change rapidly.
You should avoid all political demonstrations and public gatherings. Keep up to date with developments in the security situation, including through monitoring local media.
Road travel
Road travel is highly dangerous. The security situation has significantly increased the risks associated with travel and any road move within the country is highly dangerous.
The situation at Afghanistan’s border crossings remains volatile. A number of borders remain closed and if opened, can be subject to unannounced closures at short notice. There have been clashes between Afghan and neighbouring forces at various border crossings.
We advise against all travel to and around Afghanistan.
Air travel
Commercial flight operations have restarted at a small number of airports in Afghanistan. We advise UK nationals travelling overseas to take account of any safety notices published by the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) when considering whether to use an air carrier.
