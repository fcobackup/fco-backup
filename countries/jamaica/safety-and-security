Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Jamaica
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Jamaica, attacks cannot be ruled out.
Political situation      
The government can put enhanced security measures in place in response to outbursts of violence and shootings. These can include curfews imposed with little notice, or the military working alongside or in place of police. Check locally whether any security measures or curfews apply and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Crowds and demonstrations
Protests and demonstrations occur across Jamaica and can cause significant disruption to traffic and public transportation. Any event with large crowds has the potential to turn violent, including large celebratory gatherings. They can also be used by criminals as cover for robbery and theft.
Crime
Crime rates are high in and around Kingston and Montego Bay. Gang violence and shootings are common in inner city areas. Be cautious when travelling to or within:
West Kingston
Grants Pen
August Town
Harbour View
Spanish Town
parts of Montego Bay, including Flankers, Barrett Town, Norwood, Glendevon, Rose Heights and Mount Salem
Protecting yourself and your belongings
The motive for most attacks on tourists is robbery. Be aware of your surroundings and:
do not walk in isolated areas or deserted beaches even during the day
be careful when withdrawing money from ATMs
avoid using buses at night
Most hotels and resorts are well guarded, but burglaries can occur. Follow hotel security instructions, use hotel safes and lock windows and doors. In residential accommodation ensure that proper locks and window grilles are fitted.
Rape and sexual assault  
There have been incidents where tourists and visitors have been targets for rape and sexual assault. Take care when using dating apps in Jamaica, especially those used by the LGBT+ community. Criminals have used apps to lure victims to meet in a public place but later assault and rob them.

Laws and cultural differences
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
It’s illegal to smoke marijuana (ganja) in Jamaica. There are penalties for all drug offences including those involving marijuana. For possession of amounts of up to 2 ounces you will get a fine of 500 Jamaican dollars, to be paid within 30 days. Severe penalties apply for all other drug related offences, including attempting to export narcotics.
All prison sentences are served in full in Jamaica. Prison conditions are harsh. Always pack your own luggage and do not carry anything through customs for someone else.
LGBT+ travellers
Male same-sex sexual activity is illegal, but the law is not always strictly enforced. The attitude of many Jamaicans towards same-sex relationships is hostile. Be mindful of local attitudes and be aware that showing affection in public may receive unwanted attention.

Transport risks
Travel to and from Norman Manley International Airport
There’s been sporadic violence in recent years in the Mountain View area – one of 2 routes between Kingston and Norman Manley International Airport. Most people take the Humming Bird route via South Camp Road to reduce the risk of being robbed on route.
British nationals have been tracked and robbed when travelling from the airport to their private accommodation. Be cautious when driving and getting out of the car.
Road travel    
If you are planning to drive, see information on driving abroad.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Jamaica. If you still have a paper driving licence, you need to update it to a photocard licence. Your UK driving licence can be used to drive in Jamaica for up to 6 months.
If you are unfamiliar with Kingston, do not drive in the city. If you get lost, you and your passengers may be at risk.
Drink-driving is a serious offence in Jamaica. If convicted, you may get a fine and possible imprisonment.
Road conditions
Many roads are badly maintained with poor signage. Road accidents and fatalities are common. Roads in rural areas are often narrow and winding and poorly lit at night. Speeding and drink-driving is common.
Drivers and front-seat passengers must wear a seatbelt at all times. However, hire cars and minibuses do not always have rear seatbelts.
Motorbike riders must wear a helmet.
Taxi safety
Use Jamaican Tourist Board (JTB) approved taxis and minibuses for excursions, airport transfers and sightseeing. Most hotels and resorts have assigned JTB drivers who carry photo ID and display a blue JTB sticker on the front windscreen.
Extreme weather and natural disasters   
Hurricanes
Hurricane season is normally from June to November. We are seeing more uncharacteristic weather in Jamaica and the region is increasingly vulnerable to climate change impacts.
Hurricanes can cause fallen trees, damaged or blocked roads and flooding. Check your route in advance. Exercise caution in areas close to swamps, rivers, gullies and mangroves.
Monitor local news and check World Meteorological Association weather reports for Jamaica.
See Extreme weather and natural hazards for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane.
Earthquakes
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
