Entry and borders
The Romanian Government has announced that from 8pm (GMT) on 22 March, non-Romanians, except those from the UK, EU or EEA countries and Switzerland, will be refused entry to Romania. There are exceptions for the following categories of people:
Family members of Romanian citizens
Family members of citizens of the UK, EU or EEA countries, or Switzerland, with residence in Romania
People with a long stay visa, residence permit or equivalent document issued by the Romanian government or an equivalent document issued by the authorities of another state in accordance with EU law
People who have moved for professional reasons, with a visa, residence permit or equivalent document
Diplomatic or consular staff, staff of international organisations, military personnel or those assuring humanitarian aid
Passengers in transit, including those who are being repatriated under the grant of consular protection
Passengers travelling with urgent need (medical or family)
People who need international protection or for other humanitarian reasons
You should not attempt to travel to Romania if you do not have UK, EU, EEA, or Swiss citizenship, or fall in one of the above exceptions, as you are likely to be refused boarding or entry. Flights from Germany, France, Spain, and Italy have been suspended. Restrictions on flights from the UK could be imposed at any time, and at short notice.
All flights, bus, and rail routes from Italy are suspended.
Quarantine and self-isolation requirements
All travellers arriving in Romania, including transit passengers and those coming from the UK are now expected to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival, effective from 25 March.
There are mandatory quarantine requirements, in an institution such as a hospital, if you have travelled from Italy, France, Germany, Spain and Iran.
Infringements on these procedures are being pursued with fines of up to €4000 and possible criminal charges.
Local measures
Further restrictive measures were announced by the Romanian Government on 24 March. Current restrictions within Romania, which are to be enforced by the police and the army, include:
A ban on movement out of doors unless for food shopping, exercise (for people and pets) near your residence, essential work, or medical emergencies
A complete ban on leaving residences for those over the age of 65, with local authorities instructed to provide support and assist in food supplies
Electronic monitoring of those in self-isolation or quarantine
The closure of national museums and other tourist attractions such as the Palace of the Parliament
Closure of all schools in the country until at least 22 April, with all universities suspending courses until 31 March
Asking private companies based in cities and with over 99 employees to vary working hours to reduce overcrowding on public transport. Government ministries have been mandated to work with much lower staffing levels
Advised against non-essential use of public transport
Anyone outside will have to present on request a written statement or employer’s certificate explaining why they are outside. The public health system is already under significant strain.
