The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Myanmar
The Government of Myanmar has suspended all international commercial passenger flights from any of its airports until 31 July. It will then review the situation.
New tourist visa applications are currently suspended until 31 July.
At present Myanmar authorities can offer business visas to foreign nationals with a compelling case. You or your employer must make your case to your nearest Myanmar Embassy and obtain permission.
These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice.
All business visa arrivals will need to:
Have completed one week quarantine before boarding a flight to Myanmar. This can be verified by an employer’s, doctor’s or self-declaration. You may only leave your place of quarantine in the final 72 hours preceding travel to take a COVID-test.
Be temperature-checked on arrival in Myanmar and provide a “COVID-FREE” certificate issued in the previous 72 hours.
Complete 7 days quarantine in a government facility or government approved hotel (allocated on arrival).
Complete a further 7 days of self-isolation at home at a verifiable address.
Complete a further COVID test conducted by the National Health Laboratory during the second week of quarantine. The cost is MMK 150,000.
Testing/Screening on arrival
There are temperature checks for all arrivals. Arrivals must provide a “COVID-FREE” certificate issued in the previous 72 hours.
Quarantine Requirements
Arrivals in Myanmar must enter government-arranged quarantine. You will be allotted your quarantine facility on arrival. You will have no choice but will be placed in the same government quarantine facility or hotel as all the other people on your flight. You will be provided with food, for which you will be charged.
Arrivals will be tested for coronavirus after 7 days of quarantine. If you test negative, you will be required to complete a further 7 days of quarantine, but this can be home quarantine. If you test positive, you will be transferred to a designated government hospital for Covid patients. You will be required to remain for 28 days in hospital, after which you can leave if you have tested negative for Covid for two consecutive weeks prior.
If hospitalised with coronavirus, patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are generally expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to purchase food or make phone calls.
These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice.
Data collection
Arrivals will be expected to provide contact details. We are not aware of any requirement to download an app.
Regular Entry Requirements
Before travel, we advise that all visitors check with their nearest Myanmar Embassy to confirm their current visa will allow them entry, or the criteria for obtaining or renewing a visa.
Visas
British Nationals usually resident in Myanmar but currently away with expired business visas, should apply for a single entry business visa at your nearest Myanmar Embassy (with a sponsorship letter from your employer). You should then apply for a long term multi-entry visa in Myanmar when you return.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Myanmar. The British Government has advised the Myanmar government of a “virtual six-month extension” for all British passports’ validity.
Yellow fever
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Myanmar. However, ETDs are accepted for exit from Myanmar.
