Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in The Bahamas. The Bahamian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including entry restrictions.
Emergency measures are in place including a strict curfew from 24 â€“ 31 March. From 24 March until 9am 31 March The Bahamas have closed all airports and ports to incoming flights and vessels. Outbound flights are allowed but are likely to be severely disrupted. No direct flights to Europe have been possible since 22 March due to previously announced restrictions.
Travellers can expect disruption to flights and should contact their airlines, travel agents and tour operators. For information on how to return to the UK from The Bahamas, see Return to the UK.
