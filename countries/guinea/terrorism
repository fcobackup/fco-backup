Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Guinea. As seen in Mali, Côte D’Ivoire and Burkina Faso, terrorist groups continue to mount attacks on beach resorts, hotels, cafés and restaurants visited by foreigners. Be especially vigilant in these places.
Guinea contributes to the UN peacekeeping initiative in Mali (MINUSMA) and may therefore be considered a legitimate target by Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) and its associated groups.
JNIM and its associates mainly operate in the Sahel. The Sahel region includes Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, but the threat may extend to other neighbouringcountries and the region due to the porous nature of the borders and the desire from these groups to demonstrate capability and increasing influence across the wider region.

There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
