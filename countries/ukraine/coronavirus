Entry and borders
With effect from 15 March, foreign citizens who are not residents of Ukraine will not be allowed to enter the country. If there are compelling compassionate or humanitarian reasons, the Ukrainian authorities may be willing to give special permission for visitors to travel.
As an alternative to the requirement for people returning to Ukraine to spend 14 days in quarantine at a specialist centre a scheme enabling 14 days of self-isolation monitored through the “Dii Vdoma” app has been introduced. It is necessary to obtain a Ukrainian mobile phone number and have the sim card activated in advance of arrival in the country, though you do not need to have the Ukrainian sim in your phone on arrival. More information about the app is available on the Cabinet of Ministers website link to guidance. People who do not register with the Dii Vdoma app, or who do not abide by its terms, are required to complete quarantine at a government-approved observation centre.
Foreign citizens already in Ukraine are permitted to leave. However since 17 March, many of Ukraine’s land borders are closed.
Scheduled flights, train and bus services to and from Ukraine have been suspended. There are extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Ukraine.
Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
Visa expiry
Where the restrictions on travel and availability of government services mean that foreigners stay in Ukraine beyond the period permitted by their visa-free limit or visa validity, or that they are unable to extend residence permits, there will be no penalties imposed.
Local measures
The Government of Ukraine has introduced some restrictive measures, which will be in effect until at least 11 May.
schools and universities have been closed
all public (cultural, entertainment, sports, social, religious and other) gatherings involving more than 10 people are prohibited
restaurants, cafes, entertainment centres, fitness centres, and cultural establishments are closed, as are shops except supermarkets, pharmacies, banks and petrol stations
metro networks are closed
intercity and interregional trains and buses, domestic flights are suspended
use of public transportation in Kyiv is limited to critical sector workers. Special routes will be operated and travellers will need to prove that they work in such sectors to board. Kyiv City Council requires passengers on public transport to wear a face mask
local buses and trams continue to operate in other regions but may only carry 10 passengers at a time
from 24 March, Kyiv State Administration requires all staff and customers to wear face masks in all shops, including supermarkets, grocery stores and pharmacies
It is forbidden:
to be in public places without a mask or respirator
to gather out of doors in groups of more than two people, except with children or in cases of special need
for under-16s to be in public places, unless accompanied by an adult

Additional restrictions are also being introduced in Chernivtsi and some other areas of the country. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence.

Healthcare
If you have COVID-19 symptoms, such as a dry cough, respiratory difficulties, and a high temperature, you should:
if you have insurance or a private medical provider in Ukraine, seek assistance from them in the first instance
if you do not have insurance or your symptoms are more severe, call an ambulance on 103. Please note that the ambulance service may not have English-speaking operators available. In this case, please enlist the help of a Ukrainian or Russian-speaking friend, family member, hotel worker etc to help you call the ambulance
In both cases, you are likely to be advised to self-isolate, or be taken to a hospital where you will be tested for coronavirus. In case of a positive diagnosis, please inform the British Embassy Kyiv by calling +380 44 490 3660 or by completing this web contact form, or ask a friend or relative to contact us on your behalf.
If taken to hospital, you are likely to be tested for coronavirus. The choice of hospital will depend on your location and the availability of hospitals and/or beds.
Please note that foreign nationals may be required to pay for medical treatment – please speak to your insurance company to determine if you are covered for the cost of any treatment.
If you come into contact with someone who is confirmed to have COVID-19, or has COVID-19 symptoms, you must self-isolate for 14 days. Contact your insurer or private medical provider, or call an ambulance on 103, should you develop symptoms yourself. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence.
