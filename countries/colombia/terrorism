Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Colombia. The threat comes from the National Liberation Army (ELN), dissidents from the demobilising FARC guerrilla group (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), and other illegal armed groups.
The National Liberation Army (ELN) terrorist organisation continues plotting possible attacks in Colombia. They may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.
An improvised explosive device (IED) exploded in the Andino Shopping Centre in Bogota on 17 June 2017. You should always remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local security authorities should an incident occur.
The Colombian Government officially announced the FARC had handed over their weapons on 27 June, marking the end of their status as an armed group.
However, dissident members of the FARC and other illegal armed groups exist, and there are still instances of indiscriminate attacks against public transport, industrial infrastructure (eg oil and energy facilities), government buildings and other state installations.
The principal intended target of these attacks is not usually foreign tourists. However, the pattern of these attacks means that incidents in public spaces and other areas visited by foreigners can’t be ruled out. Past methods of attack have included car bombs, grenade attacks and explosive devices left in buildings.
In many areas of Colombia, the security situation can change very quickly. You should pay close attention to warnings issued by the Colombian authorities and monitor this travel advice. You should be particularly cautious and vigilant during any major events.
Kidnapping
There is a high risk of kidnap from both terrorist and criminal groups. While Colombians are the primary targets, foreigners can also be targeted, especially those working for (or believed to be working for) oil, mining and related companies.
You should regularly reassess your security arrangements and consider carefully any travel around the country.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
