There could be flight restrictions at short notice, so if you’re in Bangladesh and wish to leave, you should make arrangements as soon as possible.
For the time being, Biman Airlines are flying to London and Manchester. The British High Commission understands that flights to Hong Kong, China and Thailand will continue (although Thai authorities require a medical certificate to enter or transit through Thailand).
If you’re travelling via a third country, check the latest travel advice for each country.
The British High Commission Dhaka is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information for British nationals wishing to leave Bangladesh.
