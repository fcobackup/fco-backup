Only go outside for food, health reasons or work (but only if you cannot work from home)
If you go out, stay 2 metres (6ft) away from other people at all times
Wash your hands as soon as you get home
Do not meet others, even friends or family.
You can spread the virus even if you donâ€™t have symptoms.

Advice to return home is aimed at British nationals travelling abroad rather than those who are permanent residents overseas who are urged to follow the advice of the local authorities.
British nationals who wish to leave should contact their airline or travel company and insurance provider as soon as they are able, and keep up to date with the latest developments.
A reduced flight service still operates between Hargeisa and Addis Ababa for those wishing to leave Somaliland. You should check the Ethiopia travel advice for transit arrangements.
