Land crossings
Restrictions also apply at land crossings between Israel and Jordan, and between the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Jordan. Visitors should follow guidelines from Israel’s Ministry of Health and the Palestinian Authority, which are regularly updated, and be alert to local changes.

The Jordan River / Sheikh Hussein and Yitzhak Rabin/ Wadi Arraba crossings between Jordan and Israel are closed in both directions.
The Palestinian Authority (PA) has issued restrictions for visitors and residents in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including in the Bethlehem area. Foreign nationals are not currently able to cross checkpoints to enter Bethlehem.
You may face delays or restrictions at Israeli controlled checkpoints around the West Bank, including when attempting to leave the West Bank. Foreign nationals who are currently in the West Bank must leave six hours before their scheduled flight and travel direct to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport. If you are part of an organised tour group, you will travel on an Israeli bus which will be escorted by Israeli police direct to the airport. If you are travelling alone, you can take an Israeli taxi to the airport six hours before your flight. No prior coordination with the Israeli authorities is necessary. You will need to show your passport and flight ticket to authorities at the Israeli controlled checkpoint.
Flights
Most airlines have suspended or reduced flight operations to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport. From 29 March 2020, there will be no routine direct flights between Israel and the UK until further notice.
Some airlines are still operating international flights from Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport. Israir Airlines continues to operate a number of one-off flights to European destinations. For further information please check their website in Hebrew only.

Further travel restrictions and flight suspensions, including of currently scheduled flights, may be introduced at short notice. If you live in the UK and are currently travelling in Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories, you are strongly advised to return to the UK now, where and while there are still commercial routes available.
