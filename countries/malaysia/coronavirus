On 12 January, HM Yang di-Pertuan Agong announced a State of Emergency in Malaysia in response to the COVID situation and temporary flooding. This is not expected to have any additional impact on British nationals in Malaysia, but the position might change at short notice.
Visa overstays
The government of Malaysia previously announced that those who have overstayed on a social visit pass that has expired since 1 January 2020 can leave Malaysia and return to their home country up to 31 December 2020 with no penalty. On 1 January 2021, the government of Malaysia informed us that foreign nationals with expired visitors’ visas (social visit passes) are now allowed up to 14 days after the Movement Control Order ends on 31 March 2021 to leave the country.
