British nationals in Indonesia who wish to leave, should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
The number of international flights out of Indonesia is reducing daily, to destinations within the region and globally, so you may not be able to leave Indonesia when you had planned to. Flights and medical evacuation may not be available, or become very expensive if you do not depart soon. Support for British Nationals in the country is available 24/7 on +62 02123565200.
