There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Luxembourg.
A limited passenger service operated by Luxair from Luxembourg Airport (Findel) to London is scheduled to resume on 29 May. You should consult the Luxair website for details of these services.
Travellers should also consult the travel advice for France and Belgium for further detail on any travel restrictions.

Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
