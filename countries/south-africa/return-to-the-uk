South African airspace is closed to commercial airlines as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus. International commercial passenger flights are unlikely to resume for some time.
Land borders
Land borders to neighbouring countries are closed except for essential trade.
Flights
The British government has finished operating charter flights between South Africa and the UK. We are not planning any more of these flights.
The UK and some other countries are supporting airlines to run a number of repatriation flights, which British nationals may use to travel to the UK get connecting flights to the UK. Those intending to travel should hold a valid visa or permit to reside (i.e. to live, work, and/or study on a long-term basis) in the UK. The High Commission cannot support those who obtain short term visit visas, other than in exceptional (e.g. compassionate) circumstances, as short-term visitors do not qualify for repatriation flights under current South African Government regulations.
All repatriation flights are subject to approval from the South African authorities. It is not uncommon for such approval to be granted after flights have been advertised. You should therefore check with all airlines offering flights whether their published schedules are confirmed or subject to change before booking tickets and travelling. If the flight is subject to change, you should check with your airline 48 hours before you travel to ensure the flight is still going ahead. If your flight is not going ahead you will likely be rebooked on an alternative flight at a later date. You may also wish to check with the airline what their policy is with regards to reimbursement following the cancellation of a flight.
You should check with your airline whether they require you to have a negative COVID-19 test result prior to travel.
The British High Commission is not responsible for the organisation or approval of the flights listed below. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter.

Transiting South Africa for a Repatriation flight
You may need permission from the South African authorities to catch a flight departing from South Africa, if you have to first transit into South Africa from a neighbouring country. The South African authorities will usually only allow people to transit into South Africa to catch a repatriation flight if there is no alternative flight from the country you are currently in. You should make your request 10 working days before you need to travel by submitting an enquiry through our online form, or calling your local Embassy or High Commission.
Private planes and boats
