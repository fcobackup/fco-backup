Extensive damage was caused by Hurricane Irma on 6 September, and the islands were then further impacted by Hurricanes Jose and Maria. There is widespread damage to infrastructure with a large proportion of homes and buildings very badly damaged. Some roads are impassable or the road surfaces have been washed away. As more stores reopen, access to medical supplies, food and water is returning to normal. Power supplies have been badly affected. Large areas of Tortola, other islands, and most homes, remain without power or water.
The Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport on Tortola is open to commercial flights between 7am and 9pm. Most sea ports are now open and some ferry services have resumed operations. Communications have been damaged across the islands, including mobile phone networks and coverage remains patchy. The security situation remains stable.
Visitors should be aware that recovery and clean-up efforts continue. Swimmers should be mindful that debris may remain on some beaches or in the sea, and should exercise caution.

The hurricane season usually runs from June to November and further storms could affect the Caribbean. The impact of these could be particularly severe in light of the damage already caused by Hurricane Irma. You’re advised to monitor updates from the US National Hurricane Centre and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders, in the case of any further storms.
