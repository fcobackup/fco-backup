Given the rise of the number of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) the Government of Liberia has announced the suspension of all commercial flights (except cargo, charter and special flights) for 21 days, effective 23:59 GMT 23 March. This suspension will run until at least 14 April and authorities may decide to extend the suspension.
Currently all land borders (with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire) are closed to travellers.
