See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Domestic travel
Air Travel
Many commercial domestic flights may be cancelled at short notice. COVID-19 prevention measures vary depending on where you start your journey and your destination. You should check with your travel provider on the status of your flight and prevention measures in place at your destination and/or on return, before travelling.
Inter-province public transport
Transport services may be cancelled or suspended at short notice. You should check with your travel provider on travel restrictions and any COVID-19 prevention measures in place at your destination and/or on return.
International travel
Commercial flights to and from Vietnam remain very limited. A number of airline websites allow online booking from Vietnam. However, check carefully in advance whether these flights are guaranteed to fly and whether they are passenger flights. Flights and transit arrangements are still prone to changes and cancellation with little notice.
Until further notice, all passengers, including infants and children, departing from Tan Son Nhat airport (Ho Chi Minh City) are required to present a negative COVID-test to board their flight.
You should check with your travel agent or airline before travelling for any last minute change and/or additional travel requirements.
There are some restrictions on airside transit at airports you may transit when travelling to and from Vietnam which you should check in advance to ensure you will be able to transit, particularly transit times, visa and transit visa requirements and whether your baggage can be transferred airside at transit points.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Vietnam.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government requirements. The Vietnamese authorities have issued information on testing facilities and procedures (only available in Vietnamese). The testing facilities can be contacted directly.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport and/or rule changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Public spaces and services
The measures to combat COVID-19 vary from province to province and can be expected to change at short notice. You should be alert to local variations, take a precautionary approach and be ready to comply with local authorities. You should also ensure that you have your ID/passport with you. Before travelling to another province you should check with your travel provider and/or accommodation what requirements are in place, both where you are travelling to and on return. Some provinces may require negative COVID-19 tests to be obtained before and/or after entry. Mask wearing is compulsory in public settings. Those not wearing masks may be liable to spot fines.
Hanoi
From 14 October, Hanoi has relaxed many of its COVID-19 prevention and control measures. Social distancing rules remain in place and you should follow these strictly.
The rules include but are not limited to:
You should remain 2 metres from others, wear a mask and follow hand-washing guidelines
a ban on gatherings of more than 30 people outside of schools, offices and hospitals
When arriving in Hanoi you must complete a health declaration and provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken up to 72 hours before arrival. If you have been fully vaccinated you must have a test on day 1 and self-monitor for 7 days. If you are not fully vaccinated and are coming from a level 3 area, you must self-isolate at home for 7 days on arrival in Hanoi, self-monitor for 7 days thereafter and have 2 tests, on days 1 and 7. If you are not fully vaccinated and are coming from a level 2 area, you must self-monitor for 14 days and have 2 tests, on days 1 and 7.
These rules are liable to change. Check with local authorities / your travel operator before you travel.
Ho Chi Minh City
Restrictions in most areas of Ho Chi Minh City have eased. Residents who have been vaccinated at least 14 days prior, who have recovered from COVID-19 for at least 180 days, or who are under 18, may travel around the City. You should install on your phone the VNEID app registering your travel and the Y Te HCM app (recording vaccination status). You should also carry other proof of your vaccinations.
Most shops and many services are operating, with some restrictions. For many shops, including supermarkets, there may be restrictions on the number of people allowed to enter at a time. VNEID QR codes and/or health declarations, masks and temperature checks may be required to enter.
There may be local variations so you should talk to your landlord or local ward authorities or resident group (tổ dân phố) for details as to what restrictions are in place in your area.
The following provisions will continue to apply:
Maintain social distancing, wear a mask, wash hands, no gatherings of more than 20 outside schools and offices and complete health declarations
Residents should ensure they have their medical declaration QR code with them at all times
If you experience COVID-19 symptoms you should report to your local Ward Response Team or call 115

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Vietnam
We will update this page when the Government of Vietnam announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Vietnamese vaccination programme started in March 2021. Currently approved by the Vietnamese Government for use in Vietnam are the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), Sinopharm, Sputnik V, Hayat-Vax and Abdala vaccines.
Depending on vaccine availability Vietnam has approved the combination of vaccines: Moderna and Pfizer and Astra Zeneca and Pfizer.
The Vietnamese authorities have confirmed that foreign residents will be offered vaccines as part of the vaccination programme, in line with Vietnam’s priority groups, if they choose to join the programme. You should also check if your employer has their own vaccination programme and check our social media for updates on vaccination availability.
If you are over 18, you can register for vaccination in Vietnam (website in English and Vietnamese) on the Vietnamese National Vaccine Registration Portal or download the e-health app (in Vietnamese only), after which you will receive instructions on how to register for vaccination. Additionally, you can register offline through your local residence group (Tổ dân phố) who will be involved in organising local vaccinations. Please talk to your landlord, local ward authorities, or local residence group for details, as these may differ according to your ward.
If you are aged above 65 or with underlying health conditions, you may be required to be vaccinated in hospital rather than a non-hospital setting.
If you are a British national aged 18+ living in Vietnam and wish us to pass on your details to the Vietnamese authorities running the vaccination programme, please download and complete this word document.
Return the completed document by attachment, to ConsularEnquiries.Vietnam@fco.gov.uk.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the Gov.UK website COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
