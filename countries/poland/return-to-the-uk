If youâ€™re in Poland and wish to leave, you should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
LOT Polish Airlines special flights
LOT Polish Airlines are operating a limited number of special flights from Warsaw Chopin Airport to the UK. To book seats on remaining flights in these exceptional circumstances, LOT airlines have asked the British Embassy to collect the full name, contact number and email address for each prospective passenger. If you wish LOT airlines to contact you about how to book tickets, please submit the necessary information.
The British Embassy in Warsaw will then pass on those details to LOT, who will contact British nationals directly to complete the booking, including confirmation of the flight details, and to take a credit or debit card payment. If you are not a British national, please contact your appropriate Embassy in Warsaw. Please note that the British Embassy is not party to any agreement between the customer and the airline and is not in a position to guarantee any flight availability of date preferences. Travellers will still be personally responsible for their travel costs.
Polish authorities may check the temperature of passengers booked onto these special flights and may deny boarding to any passengers displaying relevant symptoms.
Other air travel
No other airlines are operating to the UK at this time. The suspension of international air transport is due to last until 28 March, but may be extended. Further flight cancellations are therefore possible.
The Polish government is also arranging charter flights to return Poles and qualifying non-Polish nationals (see below for criteria) to Poland, including from London. Details and ticket information available via LOT Airlines (in Polish)
Land borders
The land borders remain open for those leaving Poland at designated land border crossings, though the situation could change rapidly. Countries neighbouring Poland have also introduced border restrictions (Czech Republic, Germany, Lithuania, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine). Check country specific FCO travel advice for details.
On 18 March, Germany introduced further restrictions for EU citizens entering Germany, including by road. EU citizens (including UK Nationals) may still transit Germany from Poland to return home provided they can demonstrate this intention with concrete evidence - for example an onward flight, ferry or train ticket) However, entry is ultimately a discretionary decision for Border Guards.
