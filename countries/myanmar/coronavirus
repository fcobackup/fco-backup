Travel in Myanmar
In some areas there may be local requirements for visitors from other parts of the country to quarantine or self-isolate for up to at least 28 days on arrival. Further local preventative measures may also be in effect in regions, townships, wards, and village tracks across Myanmar, including in Yangon. Additional movement restrictions may be imposed in specific townships if COVID-19 cases are found. You should check with local authorities for information on possible local preventative measures.
The following townships in Yangon are under ‘Stay at Home’ orders from 8am on 2 September; Thingangyun, Insein, North Okkalapa, Thaketa, Pazuntaung, Mingalardon and Hlaing. Further townships might be added as the situation develops. A curfew from 11pm until 4am each day is currently in effect in Yangon.
The government of Myanmar currently advises foreign nationals against all but essential travel to Rakhine State, in response to an increased number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the area. All townships in Rakhine State are currently subject to ‘Stay at Home’ orders. A curfew from 9pm until 4am each day is currently in effect in all townships with reported COVID-19 cases.
Those living in an area under a ‘Stay at Home’ order should stay in their homes, unless they have permission from the local ward administrator to go outside. Permission to go outside is generally only granted to those who are preforming specific tasks recognised by the government, or for one person per household to go shopping, or for two persons per household to go to a medical hospital or clinic. If you are in an area under a ‘Stay at Home’ order you should contact the local ward administrators for details, including any requirements that may be specific to that location.
Anyone wishing to travel outside of a township subject to a ‘Stay at Home’ order will need permission from the local government. Any person travelling from a township placed under a ‘Stay at Home’ order, to another part of Myanmar may be placed in a government quarantine facility for at least 14 days upon arrival at their destination. This will include testing for COVID-19 for which foreign nationals may be charged. Those travelling by air may need to home quarantine for a further 7 days.
This guidance from the government of Myanmar is subject to change, and you should check the information issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on their website and on their Facebook page before you travel inside Myanmar. If you are outside of Myanmar, you should refer to your nearest Myanmar Embassy.
Since 13 May it has been compulsory for anyone going out in public in Myanmar to wear a facemask. Failure to wear one will result in a fine. This requirement is being enforced strictly and has led to the arrest of some offenders.
It is recommended that foreigners carry:
passport
Form C (immigration document)
Foreigner’s Registration Certificate
Myanmar Driver’s Licence (if you own a car)
a copy of your passport information page
a copy of your Myanmar visa
a copy of your immigration stamp showing when you last entered Myanmar.
Accommodation
There have been reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign tourists are staying in registered hotels and guest houses, not in private apartments. If you are on a tourist visa and are not currently staying in a registered hotel or guest house, you should move into one now. This is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa.
Some hotels have reopened but many tourist resorts remain closed.
Public places and services
Some restaurants, bars and shops have reopened with temperature checks and social distancing measures in place. Some shopping centres may require customers to register their details upon entry. You must wear a face mask in public places.
The government of Myanmar ordered all schools, including private ones, to close from 26 August. The date for re-opening has not yet been announced.
Myanmar visa extensions / renewals and UK passport / UK visa applications
For those with tourist/social visit visas the Myanmar government has agreed that overstays will be permitted with no legal penalty. When you leave Myanmar you will be required to pay an overstay fee of US $3 per day of overstay for the first 90 days and a fee of US $5 per day thereafter. This is payable in cash to the Immigration Department at Yangon Airport.
British Nationals usually resident in Myanmar but currently away with expired business visas should apply for a single entry business visa at your nearest Myanmar Embassy (with a sponsorship letter from your employer). You should then apply for a long term multi-entry visa in Myanmar when you return.
New tourist visa applications are currently suspended.
Applications for UK passports and UK visas are normally processed on Gov.uk with papers submitted at the VFS office at the Hledan Centre in Yangon. The VFS office has now reopened. For further information please see the VFS website.
Healthcare
If you are currently in Myanmar and are displaying symptoms of coronavirus, you should consult your healthcare provider. You may then be asked to notify the Myanmar National Hotline for Coronavirus (+95 67 3420268) and be transferred to a public health facility for testing.
If you test positive for the virus, you are highly likely to be transferred to a Government quarantine hospital until you have recovered. Patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to purchase food or make phone calls.
The coronavirus pandemic is expected to put significant pressure on Myanmar’s medical facilities. They may not be able to offer routine care.
It may be difficult for you to travel to a neighbouring country for medical attention. You should check your personal arrangements with your healthcare provider.
