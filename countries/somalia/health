Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Somalia.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 999 and ask for an ambulance.
If that number does not work, call the Somali Red Crescent on 445 for emergency services.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest information on vaccination recommendations in TravelHealthPro’s Somalia guide
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
Go to TravelHealthPro to see what health risks you’ll face in Somalia, including:
cholera
polio
The humanitarian situation in Somalia has led to a large displacement of people, and a growth in refugee camps which are overpopulated. This has led to health insecurity and an increase of exposure to disease, particularly around the refugee camps.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare in Somalia
There are basic hospital facilities in Hargeisa. Elsewhere, medical facilities are extremely limited and often at great distances. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, evacuation by air ambulance and repatriation.
FCDO has a list of medical facilities in Somalia where some staff will speak English.
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
