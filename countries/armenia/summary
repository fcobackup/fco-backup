Armenia was engaged in widespread military activity along the Line of Contact in Nagorno-Karabakh during 2020. Protests sometimes take place in central Yerevan and other major cities. These are usually organised by opposition political parties or activist groups highlighting topical social and political issues. Although protests tend to be peaceful and usually pass off without incident, you should avoid large crowds and demonstrations, follow the advice and instructions of the local authorities, monitor the media and remain vigilant.
The border between Armenia and Azerbaijan is closed. There have been many instances of military clashes across the border during the last 12 months, resulting in a number of deaths and casualties. We advise against all travel within 5km of the border. See Safety and security and FCDO travel advice for Azerbaijan.
Take extra care near military emplacements and in villages and connecting roads between the main M16/H26 artery and the border to its east. See Local travel
Consular support is not available in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. See Political situation
Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Armenia, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
