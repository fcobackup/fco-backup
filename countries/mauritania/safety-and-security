Political situation
Demonstrations are generally peaceful, but some have involved clashes with police and the use of tear gas. You should avoid political gatherings and demonstrations and take local advice about places to avoid. Always observe instructions given by the local security forces.
Crime
Crime levels are moderate but steadily increasing. You should avoid the unlit and isolated beach at Nouakchott and ‘Le Cinquième’ district after dark. A number of thefts and violent incidents have been reported there in recent years.
Local travel
Crossing the border into Mauritania can be time-consuming and officials may ask for payments before they allow you to cross. There have been reports that some southern border crossings were closed at the height of the Ebola virus outbreak in Guinea and neighbouring countries. You should check local advice before travelling.
Road travel
The conditions of paved roads in Mauritania are generally poor, and overland travel is difficult. Use four wheel drive vehicles, check the tide times on coastal roads, travel in convoy and make sure you have adequate supplies of water and fuel. Driving standards can also be poor.
Sea travel
Sailing in the port at Nouadhibou can be dangerous because of the number of shallow shipwrecks.
