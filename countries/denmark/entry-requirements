This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Denmark set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Denmark for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Denmark is assessed by risk level of the particular country you are travelling from. This is categorised by green, yellow, orange and red ratings. Danish authorities will review the risk level weekly.
The whole of the UK has an orange rating. See below for full requirements.
If you are planning a trip to Denmark check the latest travel rules before you travel. You should check with your airline for any additional testing requirements.
If you are a resident of Denmark you can enter without a worthy purpose and without presenting a negative COVID-19 test. If you are a resident but not fully vaccinated, testing on arrival and self-isolation rules apply.
Entry to Denmark – not fully vaccinated
If you are resident in the UK, you will be able to enter Denmark if you have a worthy purpose. You can see the list of worthy purposes on the Danish coronavirus website. You will need to provide evidence of your worthy purpose.
The Danish authorities require UK travellers to present proof of a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before entry or an antigen test (maximum 48 hours old by time of entry).

You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated or previously infected.
Entry to Denmark – requirements for children
Children and young people under the age of 18 who enter Denmark together with a parent who is fully vaccinated are exempt from the requirement to have a worthy purpose or to self-isolate upon entry if the parent is exempt.
However, children and young people aged 16 or above who are resident in the UK and not fully vaccinated are still required to present a negative COVID-19 test before entry, irrespective of whether they are accompanied by a fully vaccinated parent or not.

Regular entry requirements
The Danish authorities have border controls at the land border with Germany. Border controls are also in place for travellers from Rønne, Helsingør, Frederikshavn, Grenaa and those using the Øresund Bridge, including all train traffic from Sweden. These checks will be in place for an unspecified period of time.
If you’re travelling using the land border, or by rail, road, or ferry you should make sure you have your passport with you. Allow additional time, be vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities. Check with local media, your carrier, ferry operator or Danish State Railways (DSB) for more information.

Children under 18 accompanied by an adult with the appropriate ID are not required to carry ID themselves.
Visas
Greenland and the Faroe Islands aren’t members of the European Union. You don’t need a visa to enter for tourism, but you should get a work and residence permit before entry if you intend to live and work there.
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Denmark and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Danish government’s entry requirements. Check with the Danish Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need
if you stay in Denmark with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Denmark or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Danish border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Denmark. If you are resident in Denmark, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Denmark guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Denmark, or any other Schengen country
less than 10 years old
The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
