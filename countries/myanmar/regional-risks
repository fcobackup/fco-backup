Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Myanmar (Burma).

This section has safety advice for regions of Myanmar. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Border areas
Myanmar has suffered from prolonged internal conflicts, involving a number of ethnic armed organisations in the country’s border areas. Violence is severe and the situation is unpredictable in most ethnic states and border areas.
The Myanmar authorities restrict travel to most border areas. There are active military operations involving the use of air strikes, artillery bombardments and ground troops.
FCDO advises against all travel to:
Mon State
Kachin State
Chin State
Kayah State
Kayin Sate
Sagaing and Magway regions
Rakhine State
Tanintharyi Region, excluding Myeik township, and the archipelago and townships south of Tanintharyi township
Shan State North
North Mandalay Region – the townships north of Mandalay City and Pyin Oo Lwin
East of the Yangon-Mandalay Expressway in Bago region
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
Shan State South and East
Mandalay Region
Tanintharyi Region south of Tanintharyi township
the rest of Bago region
Yangon Region
While FCDO no longer advises against all but essential travel to Yangon Region, there is still a heightened risk.
The security situation remains volatile and can change at short notice. If you are visiting Yangon Region, seek local advice, especially if travelling to townships which are under martial law. The townships under martial law are subject to change and include:
Shwe Pyithar
Hlaing Tha Ya (West)
Hlaing Tha Ya (East)
North Okkalapa
Dagon Myothit (North)
Dagon Myothit (South)
Dagon Myothit (Seikkan)
Security incidents in Yangon, like in the rest of Myanmar, continue primarily to target military locations and personnel affiliated to the military. Attacks may affect civilians and bystanders, including in areas regularly frequented by foreign nationals. This may include hotels, restaurants and accommodation complexes. Military installations, such as checkpoints, are also targets.
A curfew is in place from 1am-3am across Yangon city.
If you encounter a threatening or intimidating situation, do not try to make your way through it. Turn around and move to safety.
Police and military checkpoints
If you travel in Myanmar, you are likely to pass through police or military checkpoints. Always carry your passport containing your visa. Most personnel on military and police checkpoints, including in cities, will not speak English.
