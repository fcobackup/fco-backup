Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Australia. The Australian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Travel restrictions and borders
Only Australian citizens and returning permanent residents and their immediate family members are permitted to enter Australia until further notice. Similar restrictions apply to those seeking to transit through Australia, with exemptions for passengers transiting from New Zealand until 12.00pm (AEDT) on 26 March.
Travellers who have a compassionate or compelling reason to enter or transit through Australia can apply to the Australian authorities for an exemption via an online form. The Department of Home Affairs is experiencing high levels of demand for this service and there is no guarantee of either the timing of a decision or the outcome. Given the fast changing situation, those seeking to travel or transit on from Australia, should check the latest entry rerestrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel.
British nationals who are permanent residents and are currently outside of Australia will be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival in Australia. All Australian citizens, returning permanent residents and their immediate family arriving in Australia are required to self-isolate for 14 days. Any travellers who have travelled from or transited through mainland China, Iran, Italy or South Korea will not be allowed to enter Australia until 14 days after they have left that country.
Flight options from Australia to the UK are becoming increasingly limited following the tightening of entry restrictions for Australia and for countries through which flights transit. A number of airline operators have announced that international flights to/from Australia have been suspended or will be suspended shortly. British nationals who live in the UK and are currently in Australia should seek to make arrangements to return to the UK now, where and while there are still commercial routes available. You should contact your airline, travel provider or tour operator now to make arrangements to do so. The British High Commission in Canberra is issuing regular updates on Twitter and Facebook with the latest available information on flight departure options for British nationals wishing to leave Australia.

You may otherwise find you are not able to leave Australia when you had planned to. If you are unable to leave Australia and your visa is nearing expiry, you should contact the Australian authorities as soon as possible.
Additional restrictions are now in place restricting travel between most states and territories within Australia to essential travel only. Almost all travellers crossing state boundaries are required to self-isolate for 14 days.
The government has also announced a ban on international cruise ships, effective midnight on 15 March for an initial 30 day period. Australian cruise ships continue to be able to dock in Australia. Cruise operators are responsible for putting in place arrangements for all passengers who are not Australians or permanent residents and their immediate families to transit to airports for onward travel. All passengers are required to self-isolate before transit and those remaining in Australia are required to self-isolate for 14 days minus the number of days the cruise ship has been at sea since its previous port.
Local social distancing measures
The Australian authorities have introduced a number of social distancing measures which are detailed on the Department of Health website. These are liable to change at short notice. You should monitor the website and comply with these measures and other advice from local authorities. They include:
the closure from 1200 (AEDT) on 23 March of non-essential services and places of public gathering, including clubs, nightclubs, cinemas, casinos and the licensed areas of pubs. Restaurants and cafes are now take away only. Supermarkets, banks, petrol stations, pharmacies, freight/logistics, food delivery, and most shops are considered to provide essential services and are currently exempt. Public transport is deemed as essential and is not currently affected but this could change quickly.
a ban on non-essential indoor gatherings of more than 100 people, and non essential outdoor gatherings of more than 500. All gatherings in an enclosed space must provide four square meters per person.
all members of the public are to keep at least 1.5m distance from others;
