This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Belize set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
British nationals do not need a visa to enter Belize. On arrival, you’ll be allowed to enter for one month. Any extension to remain in the country will incur a fee of BZD$200 for each month’s extension.
There are no direct flights between the UK and Belize. The regulations of countries that you may pass through and / or UK requirements on travel from transit countries may affect your travel. For more information see FCDO Travel Advice on the countries through which you may travel or transit.
There is no longer a requirement to present proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative test.
The Belize Travel Insurance is no longer mandatory for foreign tourists, though it is encouraged by the Belize Tourism Board.  
You should avoid bringing in home Covid tests; they will be confiscated if found.
Protocols and procedures are subject to change at short notice. Further information is available from the Belize Tourism Board, Travel Belize or Belize Port Authority.
