This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Kazakhstan set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Kazakhstan
UK nationals with a valid visa will be able to enter Kazakhstan once direct flights resume. This is expected on 18 September 2021. See the government of Kazakhstan website for further details.
Testing / screening on arrival
Travellers need to show a coronavirus free PCR certificate issued within three days of arrival.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Kazakh embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Quarantine requirements
Travellers entering Kazakhstan who test positive for coronavirus currently need to self-isolate for 14 days. Those needing medical assistance may be confined in state facilities.
Data collection
Travellers need to provide details of where they are staying in Kazakhstan and to confirm they will abide by all coronavirus restrictions.
Testing on departure
Travellers may be screened by having their temperature taken and assessed for other coronavirus symptoms on departure from Kazakhstan. Most travellers will also require a negative PCR test to enter the airport.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
A visa is needed to enter Kazakhstan. This is a recent change, due to the coronavirus outbreak.
You should contact your nearest Kazakh Embassy for further information.
Make sure you have the right visa for the purpose of your travel, especially for business visas or work permits. Check the validity dates of your visa and any associated restrictions carefully before you travel.
Anyone who has overstayed their visa needs to apply to the local migration service for an extension and may have to pay a fine.
Registration
As of 10 January 2020, it is the responsibility of the host person or hotel to notify immigration authorities of a foreigner’s arrival. The notification should be made within three working days from the date of the guest’s arrival in country and can be done online on the Visa and Migration portal or in writing to the Migration Service.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of three months beyond the expiry date of your visa. Your passport should also have at least 1 blank page for your visa.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry (together with a valid visa), airside transit and exit from Kazakhstan. If using an ETD to leave Kazakhstan, you may need to get an exit visa from the Migration Service (formerly the OVIR). This process can take five working days or longer. Check with the Migration Service for more information before confirming your travel plans.
Dual nationality
Dual nationality isn’t recognised in Kazakhstan. If you enter Kazakhstan on a Kazakh passport and also hold British nationality the British Embassy can only provide very limited consular assistance. In cases of arrest or detention, consular access is unlikely to be granted.
Customs
The government of Kazakhstan imposes limits on how much foreign currency can be imported or exported, and certain goods are subject to custom regulations. For further information please visit the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
