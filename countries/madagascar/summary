In 2016 over nearly 5,800 British nationals visited Madagascar. Most visits were trouble free. If possible, you should travel with established organisations or travel companies who know the terrain and have the capacity to warn of potential hazards. If hiring a guide in country, the National Tourism Office advises visitors to use the services of members of the Professional Tour Operators Association PTO.
Political demonstrations in the centre of Antananarivo are ongoing. Due to the possibility of violence at these events, you should avoid all protests and demonstrations, including those taking place in the area around Independence Square (“La Place du 13 mai”) and the Town Hall. See Safety and security
Madagascar has experienced political instability since the 2009 coup d’état. There is potential for further unrest in the run-up to Presidential elections, in November and December 2018. You should avoid political demonstrations. See Political situation
Take great care and follow local advice in the south-east of the country. In the southern triangle between Ihosy, Toliara/Tuléar and Fort-Dauphin the security situation remains tense and the roads are in very poor condition. If travelling in the area you’re advised to use a recognised tour operator and to avoid travelling at night. You’re advised not to travel by taxi-brousse (bush taxi). Avoid overnight stays in the countryside.
There have previously been violent attacks, including fatalities, on Batterie Beach north of Toliara (Tulear), most recently in 2013. You should consult a local guide, avoid remote or isolated beaches and remain vigilant during visits.
Previous cyclones, including most recently Tropical Storm Eliakim, left some remote areas inaccessible by road, and water supply systems were damaged and contaminated in some areas. Principle routes have re-opened, but check the METEO Madagascar website for the latest details.
The cyclone season in Madagascar normally runs from November to April. Coastal areas are particularly affected. You should monitor the progress of approaching storms. See natural disasters.
You should avoid travelling at night on Route Nationales (RNs) particularly RN 13 between Ambovombe and Ihosy and on the RN 10 between Betioky and Andranovory (the western route to Toliara/Tuléar). There have been several attacks on vehicles. If you’re planning to travel to Fort Dauphin you should travel by air instead of via the RN 13. See Crime and Local travel
Crime, particularly robbery and theft is widespread in Madagascar. Be vigilant in the capital Antananarivo particularly in markets and busy areas.
Be especially vigilant at night and don’t touch any suspect packages.
Maintain a low profile while moving around the country. You’re advised to use a recognised tour operator. You should monitor the local media closely for the duration of your visit. See Local travel
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Madagascar, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
