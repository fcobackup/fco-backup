This travel advice covers Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, but cases have been confirmed elsewhere, including in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The Israeli and Palestinian authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures.
The Israeli Ministry of Health, the Population and Immigration Authority and Border Control are currently prohibiting entry for non-resident visitors who had been staying in or transited through China, South Korea and Italy, or who had been staying in Thailand, Macao, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Japan in the last 14 days prior to their arrival. Non-resident visitors from France, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and Austria will not be able to enter unless they can provide proof they can be placed under home quarantine.
The Israeli Ministry of Health is also mandating a 14-day home quarantine of all returning residents who have visited mainland China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Macao, South Korea, Japan or Italy. This includes restrictions on travellers with connecting flights in mainland China, South Korea and Italy. Residents returning from France, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and Austria must be placed in home quarantine for 14 days from the day they arrive back. Anyone that has had close contact with a confirmed patient of coronavirus (defined as being within 2 metres for more than 15 minutes) should follow the home-quarantine guidance. For more information, you should contact the Israeli Ministry of Health.
The Palestinian Authority (PA) has issued restrictions for visitors and residents in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including in the Bethlehem area. On 5 March the PA announced a state of emergency lasting 30 days, including closure of educational institutions, reducing movement between cities, cancellation of public gatherings and conferences, and cancellation of tourism reservations and hotel bookings. You may face delays or restrictions at Israeli controlled checkpoints around the West Bank. You should reconfirm your arrangements with your tour operator or hotel before travelling.
Foreign nationals are not currently able to cross checkpoints to enter Bethlehem. Foreign nationals who are currently in Bethlehem must leave 6 hours before their scheduled flight and travel direct to Ben Gurion airport. If you are part of an organised tour group, you will travel on an Israeli bus which will be escorted by Israeli police direct to the airport. If you are travelling alone, you can take an Israeli taxi to the airport. No prior coordination with the Israeli authorities is necessary. You will need to show your passport and flight ticket to authorities at the Israeli controlled checkpoint on exiting Bethlehem.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
You can find more information about cases in Israel on the TravelHealthPro website and in the Occupied Palestinian Territories on the TravelHealthPro website.
Local medical care
Healthcare in Israel is not free and medical treatment can be expensive. Hospitals will insist on payment and may take legal action to delay departure until bills are met. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 101 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
