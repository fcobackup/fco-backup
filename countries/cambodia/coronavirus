Travel in Cambodia
There has been a community outbreak of COVID-19 since 20 February 2021. The lockdowns imposed on 14 April 2021 in Phnom Penh, Takhmao, Sihanoukville and Siem Reap will end on 5 May 2021, with the exception of specific red zones. Guidance is available on The Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. Those residing inside ‘Red Zones’ are requested to follow instructions provided by their local authority.

You’re expected to wear a face covering in public places. A fine may be imposed on those that refuse.
Accommodation
Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Cambodia. Some hotels have closed and remain so, and we advise that you contact hotels directly when booking. The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to complete a declaration in relation to your recent travel history and whether you have any symptoms related to COVID-19.
Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities.
Public places and services
Many public places and services such as gyms, casinos, karaoke rooms and nightclubs have been mandated to close or have closed due to a lack of custom. You should contact venues ahead of events.
On 11 March the Government of Cambodia brought in a law on “Preventive Measures Against the Spread of COVID-19 and Other Severe and Dangerous Contagious Diseases”. The Government has also launched a map with venues to avoid. We strongly recommend that you wear masks, clean your hands and maintain social distancing in all public places.

Many medications that would require a prescription in the UK can be bought over-the-counter in Cambodia. However, you may not find a brand you are familiar with and many pharmacies sell counterfeit or out of date products. The main branch of Pharmacie de la Gare in Phnom Penh can provide medications without a prescription and can deliver medications across the country. Before you travel, you should discuss with your doctor alternative brands of medication for your condition.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Cambodia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Royal Government of Cambodia has announced that all foreign nationals who are currently residing and working in Cambodia can get vaccinated against COVID-19 at no charge, in accordance with Cambodian COVID-19 Vaccination Plans. On 8 April, a new system was announced for foreigners residing in Cambodia to be vaccinated. If you live in Cambodia, you should follow the process set out by the Royal Government of Cambodia, which will be handled by the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training (MLVT) or your local authority, depending on your visa status. There is no requirement to register with the embassy.
The announcement covers those with Ordinary Visas (Visa E) and work permits issued by the MLVT. In this case you will need a valid passport, valid visa and valid work permit and should register via your employer.
If you hold a different type of visa, including Visa K, foreigners married to Khmer citizens, retirees or another type of legal long term residence, you will need a valid passport and valid visa and register alongside Khmer Citizens, via the local authority.
It may take time for you to successfully register as processes are implemented. If you do not have a valid visa you should contact the General Department of Immigration to rectify this or consider returning to the UK.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more information about the COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccines page.
