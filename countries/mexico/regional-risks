FCDO advises against non-essential travel to parts of Mexico.
This section has safety advice for regions of Mexico. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
North
Drug-related violence is a particular problem in the northern states of Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Sinaloa and Durango.
Many fatalities are suspected gang members killed in violent clashes between the different organisations that compete for control of trafficking routes into the USA. Armed clashes between security forces and drug groups can happen at any time without warning. Take extreme care outside tourist areas in all of these states.
Baja California (including Tijuana)
FCDO advise against all but essential travel to the city of Tijuana in Baja California, except:
airside transit through Tijuana airport
the cross border express taken from the airport zone
passage through Tijuana to cross the border via the federal toll road 1D and Via Rápida
We also advise against all but essential travel to the city of Tecate including the roads 2D and 2 that connects Tijuana and Tecate.
If you are crossing the border by toll road 1D try to do so during daylight, or be very cautious after dark. Tijuana is an extremely violent city and there is a risk that you may be targeted or caught up in conflicts between rival groups.
Many businesses including shops operate with an unofficial curfew, only opening during day light hours due to the security threat. There are several organised crime groups fighting for control over the city’s drugs trade and trafficking routes. There are high rates of kidnapping, murder and organised crime activity particularly drugs, human and arms trafficking.
Armed attacks and targeted killings happen across the state and violent robberies are a particular issue in the urban centres of Tijuana, Mexicali and Ensenada. Be careful in Tijuana, Mexicali, Ensenada and Rosarito, there have been several incidents of violent armed crime in these towns, which has targeted stores and bystanders in response to disputes with the government. Stay on established tourist routes and destinations across the state and be aware of your surroundings at all times.
Take care when travelling to Ciudad Juárez or other cities in Northern States. Travel during daylight hours when possible, inform relatives or friends of your travel plans and use reputable hotels only.
Take precautions in the state of Baja California, including Tijuana. There is drug-related crime in Baja California Sur, including Los Cabos.
Chihuahua
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the state of Chihuahua except:
the city of Chihuahua
the border crossing in Ciudad Juárez (accessed by federal toll road 45)
federal toll road 45D connecting the cities of Chihuahua and Ciudad Juárez
the Copper Canyon rail route to/from Chihuahua and towns immediately on this route including Creel
the road from Creel via San Juanito to San Pedro
state highway 16 from San Pedro to Chihuahua
There are high levels of organised crime activity, particularly human and drugs trafficking. There is illegal drug cultivation in rural areas of the state, with associated criminal activity.
If visiting the Copper Canyon rail route, do not walk alone in the canyon, or stray from the tourist trail. Complete all your activities within daylight hours. There are many organised crime groups operating in the area and there is a risk you could be caught up in conflicts between rival groups. Organise all activities with a reputable tour company or trusted local guide.
Sinaloa
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the state of Sinaloa except:
the cities of Los Mochis and Mazatlán
Road 32 that runs between El Fuerte and Los Mochis
the 15D federal toll road that runs the length of the state
the Copper Canyon rail route to/from Los Mochis/El Fuerte and the towns immediately on this route
Armed robbery and vehicle theft has happened in El Fuerte. Avoid driving at night on the route between El Fuerte and Los Mochis.
There are high levels of drug cultivation in rural areas, leading to conflict between organised crime groups fighting for control.
Due to the presence of organised crime, there are high levels of drug-related violence. There are frequent gun battles between government security forces and organised crime groups , including in the city of Culiacán, leading to deaths and the destruction of security infrastructure.
Whilst tourists are not usually targeted, you could be a victim of violence due to mistaken identity or on suspicion of spying for other organised criminal gangs – particularly if you are off the beaten tourist track.
Tamaulipas
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the state of Tamaulipas except:
the border crossing at Nuevo Laredo accessed from Monterrey by federal toll road 85D. You should travel during daylight hours
Tamaulipas is dangerous due to the presence of many organised crime groups who fight for control of drug trafficking routes. There is a risk of armed robbery and kidnap.
In March 2023, two foreign tourists were killed after a group were kidnapped at gunpoint in Matamoros.
Zacatecas
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the state of Zacatecas.
The state is extremely dangerous due to battles between organised crime groups for control of drug trafficking routes and rural areas of the state.
There are high levels of drug-related violence, due to the strong presence of organised crime Gun battles between state security forces and organised crime groups are frequent, leading to deaths and the destruction of security infrastructure.
East
There have been increased security incidents in the states of Tabasco and Veracruz, including the city of Veracruz. Illegal roadblocks have also been reported more frequently. You should take extreme care.
South
Criminal activity is a problem in the state of Chiapas. Take care when travelling through the state as well as outside of tourist areas. There are illegal roadblocks and checkpoints on the roads in this region. Some incidents of kidnapping have been reported. You should organise all activities with a reputable tour company or trusted local guide.
West and Central
Colima
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the whole state, except:
the city of Manzanillo reached by sea or by air via Manzanillo-Costalegre International Airport, and direct travel via road 200 from the airport to Manzanillo. Do not travel by other routes to the city of Manzanillo
Colima has high levels of organised crime activity. The criminal organisations fight each other for control over the state, this leads to armed gun battles on the streets of Colima City as well as throughout rural areas.
Guanajuato
In the state of Guanajuato, FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the areas south west of the road 45D. This includes the cities of Celaya and Irapuato as well as the municipalities of:
Abasolo
Acámbaro
Cuerámaro
Huanímaro
Irapuato
Jaral del Progreso
Manuel Doblado
Moroleón
Pénjamo
Pueblo Nuevo
Purisima del Rincón
Romita
Salamanca
Salvatierra
San Francisco del Rincón
Santiago Maravatío
Silao de la Victoria
Uriangato
Valle de Santiago
Yuriria
Guanajuato is a drug trafficking route. There have been increased security incidents and drug-related violence in the state of Guanajuato. Fuel thefts from plants and pipelines also happen. Organised crime activity is rampant, particularly in the south of the state. Shootouts are of particular concern in the state of Guanajuato as they can happen in heavily transited places with bystanders frequently being caught in the crossfire.
Guerrero (including Acapulco)
FCDO advises against all travel to the State of Guerrero except:
the city of Acapulco accessed by the 95D federal toll road
the town of Zihuatanejo/Ixtapa accessed by air
the town of Taxco accessed by the 95D and 200D federal toll roads
Guerrero is a violent state with a history of insecurity. There is a organised crime presence throughout the state, including in central Acapulco and Chilpancingo. There have been several instances of armed crime, including shootings and executions, both within and outside the tourist areas in Acapulco. The local authorities work to reduce the risks to tourists in the touristic zone in Acapulco, but you should take extreme care. Do not walk outside of your hotel at night and avoid leaving the touristic zone.
There are many illegal roadblocks where local crime groups take control of toll booths. If you come across these, you will need to have cash to pay the fee to pass through the booth. If you’re driving in Guerrero, avoid travel after dark and use toll roads where possible, although you may still experience disruptions.
The interior of the state is dangerous. The organised crime groups and local ‘self-defence’ organisations often have control. Foreigners’ presence in rural Guerrero is likely to be seen as suspicious by organised crime and local ‘self-defence’ groups, and the possibility of misunderstanding and resulting in violence is high.
There have been cases of armed crime both within and outside tourist areas in Acapulco. If possible, travel by air if you are to Acapulco. Due to an increase in violent crime, you should be extra vigilant in Acapulco and surrounding areas.
Jalisco
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the areas south and southwest of Lake Chapala to the border state of Colima. Specifically the municipalities of:
Acatlán de Juárez
Amacueca
Ameca
Atemajac de Brizuela
Atengo
Atenguillo
Atoyac

Bolaños
Chimaltitán
Colotlán
Hostotipaquillo
Huejúcar
Huequilla el Alto
Mezquitic
San Martin de Bolaños
Santa Maria de los Ángeles
Totatiche
Villa Guerrero
This is due to inaccessibility for security forces, lack of state control, drugs cultivation and the fact this area is territory disputed between different criminal groups leads to high levels of violent crime.
Michoacán
FCDO advises against all travel to the State of Michoacán except:
the city of Morelia accessed by federal toll roads 15D, 126 and 43; and the federal toll road 48D between the city of Morelia and the General Francisco Mujica airport
the town of Pátzcuaro accessed by federal toll roads 14D and 15 from Morelia, and boat trips out to islands on Lake Pátzcuaro
the federal toll road 15D that traverses the state
Michoacán is one of Mexico’s most violent states with high levels of organised crime activity and it does not have a security presence. The rural terrain of much of the state makes it difficult for state security forces to respond to incidents.
There are several illegal roadblocks and checkpoints on the roads in this region. These tend to be run by local crime groups attempting to control who is entering and leaving. The Michoacán state government itself recommends foreign nationals to avoid this region.
Outsiders travelling in these regions are likely to attract the attention of organised crime groups, who will treat them with suspicion and as possible informants for either other criminal groups or state security, outsiders may be harmed or killed if suspected of being an informant.
Centre
