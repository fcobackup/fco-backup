Since 1 January 2014 the currency in Latvia is the Euro.
All major credit cards are accepted and there are plenty of ATM machines for withdrawing local currency.
When you enter or leave the EU, you must declare the cash that you are carrying if this amounts to 10,000 Euros or more per person. This includes cheques, travellers’ cheques and money orders.
If you enter Latvia at an internal EU border and you are carrying 10,000 Euros or more, you could also be asked by the Latvian authorities to fill in a cash declaration.
