International travel
Passengers who have been in the UK within the previous 14 days, including passengers who have passed through the UK in transit, are now permitted to enter Jordan during this period subject to pre-flight and on arrival PCR testing. This also applies if you transit from the UK through a third country to enter Jordan.
British nationals affected by flight cancellations should contact their airlines for further information and for advice on possible alternative flight options via a third country. Please be aware, however, that several third countries have themselves suspended flights to and from the UK and others may follow suit at very short notice.
British nationals who require consular assistance should call the British Embassy on + 962 6 5909200 and follow instructions for consular assistance.
All passengers arriving in Jordan will require a negative PCR test within 72hrs of departure to Jordan and complete a health declaration and passenger locator form.
All passengers need to register on the ‘visitjordan’ platform and follow instructions to either book a PCR test on arrival, or claim a waiver for testing on arrival by uploading evidence that they are fully vaccinated.
You do not need to wait at the airport for PCR test results. You should proceed to your accommodation. The PCR test results will be sent by SMS. Those who test positive with severe symptoms will need to go to a COVID-19 designated hospital for isolation and treatment if required.
Sign up for travel advice email alerts and monitor British Embassy’s social media channels on Twitter and on Facebook.
Check travel advice for any country that you will transit between the UK and Jordan.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Jordan.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government requirements. The Ministry of Health has published a list of accredited testing facilities on their website (in Arabic).
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
