The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
All passengers arriving into Ireland (except those arriving from Northern Ireland) are required to have a negative/’not detected’ result from a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test carried out no more than 72 hours prior to arrival in Ireland.
Passengers will be asked to present evidence of their negative/‘not detected’ result before boarding their airplane or ferry, and will be required to produce this evidence to Immigration Officers on arrival at points of entry to the State.
Passengers who arrive in an Irish Airport or Sea Port without evidence of a negative/’not detected’ COVID-19 PCR test result will commit an offence and may be subject to prosecution, punishable by a fine not exceeding €2,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.
Exemptions are limited to international transport workers, including hauliers, pilots and aviation crew, masters and maritime crew, where they are travelling in the course of their duties. Children under six will also be exempt.
Passengers who arrive in Ireland solely for the purpose of travelling onwards to another state and do not leave the airport are also not required to provide evidence of a test.
Passengers whose journey originates in Northern Ireland are not in scope of this announcement, but any such travel is subject to the public health restrictions in place in Northern Ireland and Ireland respectively; and from Monday 8 February 2021, anyone not ordinarily resident in Ireland, engaging in travel in Ireland “without a reasonable excuse” such as essential work, education, attending a medical appointment or providing care for a vulnerable person, may be liable to receive a fine of €100. Further information is available here.
Passengers whose journey originates in Northern Ireland are not in scope of this announcement, but any such travel is subject to the public health restrictions in place in Northern Ireland and Ireland respectively.
If a citizen has a genuine humanitarian emergency requiring urgent travel, they should contact the nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate immediately for advice and consular assistance before commencing their journey.
Quarantine Requirements
The Irish Government has introduced a legal requirement that all travellers (except those whose journey originates in Northern Ireland) must quarantine on arrival, with very limited exceptions.
This applies to all arrivals from 4 February 2021:
14-day quarantine period must be undertaken at the address specified on the Passenger Locator Form
persons who travel from another country to Ireland, and arrive via Northern Ireland, must also observe the mandatory quarantine regime
If you do not fulfil the legal requirement for mandatory quarantine you are committing an offence and can be fined up to €2,500, or get a prison sentence of up to 6 months, or both.
You may only leave your place of residence during the quarantine period for unavoidable reasons of an emergency nature to protect a person’s health or welfare, or to leave Ireland.
You may leave to take a RT-PCR test no less than 5 days after your arrival – if you receive written confirmation that the result of this test is negative/ ‘not detected’ your period of quarantine can end.
You must retain the written confirmation of your test result for at least 14 days.
If your journey began in South Africa or Brazil you must complete the full 14 days of quarantine – regardless of whether you have a negative test result.

Data collection – Passenger Locator forms
If you are coming to Ireland from overseas you must complete a COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form. This is available online.
If you don’t fill in this form you can be fined up to €2,500 or get a prison sentence of up to 6 months.
If you have been overseas and travel through Northern Ireland you do not currently have to fill in the form, however new regulations will make this mandatory.
An exemption from completing the form is in place for providers of essential supply chain services such as hauliers, pilots and maritime staff.
Once you have arrived you must comply with the health restrictions in place in Ireland.
Passengers travelling to Northern Ireland must ensure that they are familiar with the guidance and regulations in place, including the completion of a UK Passenger Locator Form
Regular entry requirements
ID
Ireland, along with the UK, is a member of the Common Travel Area. British nationals travelling from the UK don’t need a passport to visit Ireland. However, Irish immigration officers will check the ID of all passengers arriving by air from the UK and may ask for proof of nationality, particularly if you were born outside the UK. You are therefore advised to take your British passport with you.
For more information about the types of ID you might be asked to present, see the website of the Ireland Citizens Information Board.
Before travelling, check with your carrier about their ID requirements, as most airlines and other transport providers won’t carry passengers to and from Ireland unless they’ve seen satisfactory photographic ID.
Passport validity
If you’re using a passport to enter Ireland, it should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry into, transit through, and exit from Ireland.
