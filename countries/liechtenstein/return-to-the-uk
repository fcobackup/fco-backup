There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Liechtenstein via Switzerland. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Liechtenstein, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Liechtenstein because commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Flights to London are available from Zurich and Geneva in Switzerland. SWISS is currently the only airline operating commercial flights to the UK. You should check the carrier’s website for the latest flight schedule and availability.
If you’re trying to get back to the UK and need financial help, see the FCO’s guide on financial assistance.
Travelling to the airport
There are no border restrictions on entering Switzerland from Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein is not connected to the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB / CFF / FFS) network. You will need to make your own arrangements to travel to Sargans train station in Switzerland.
Swiss Federal Railways (SBB / CFF/ FFS) continue to operate with a reduced service. There may be cancellations, missed connections and delays on the rail network. You should check the Swiss Federal Railways website before starting your journey.
Travel via France
It is possible to transit through France by road or rail if: • you have evidence of your onward journey and
• you do not show symptoms of illness that could indicate a coronavirus infection
An example of ‘acceptable evidence’ would include a confirmed ferry or Eurotunnel booking to the UK.
If you plan to return to the UK by road or rail via France, you should check the Travel Advice for France.
In order to enter France, you will need to complete an “international attestation”. And in order to travel through France, you should also complete a personal travel waiver certificate. Further information (including links to the forms) are available in the Travel Advice for France.
As with other forms of transport, many cross-Channel operators are operating substantially reduced services for passenger traffic. Passengers should check with their operator before departing, and may still be subject to severe disruption.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
