Local laws reflect the fact that Sudan is predominantly Muslim. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas.
In 2017, the holy month of Ramadan is expected to start on 27 May and finish on 25 June. See Travelling during Ramadan
Sudan operates Islamic Sharia Law. Alcohol is not permitted. Although the constitution specifies that in Khartoum non-Muslims shall not be subject to Sharia law, you should expect Sharia law to apply.
Non-Muslim women are not expected to wear a veil or cover their heads, but should dress modestly and respect local customs and sensitivities.
Homosexual practices and extra marital relations are illegal and subject to severe penalties. This includes inviting guests into hotel rooms. Sudanese society is not tolerant of homosexual relationships. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Since the beginning of 2013, the FCO has received reports that a large number of foreign nationals have left Sudan either because they have been asked to leave by the Sudanese authorities, or because they have come under pressure from the Sudanese security service, or because their places of work/study have been closed. Many of these people appear to have been accused of sharing their religious beliefs with Sudanese nationals or of visa irregularities.
You should carry a form of photo ID with you at all times.
There are severe penalties for drug trafficking.
All photography requires a formal permit, which you can get from the External Information Centre in Khartoum (part of the Ministry of Information). Donâ€™t take photographs or use a mobile phone camera close to government buildings, military installations, public utilities (including petrol stations), and other sensitive areas (bridges, airports etc). Many plain clothes public security officers operate.
