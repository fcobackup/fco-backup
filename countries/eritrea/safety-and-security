Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Eritrea.

This guide also has safety advice for regions of Eritrea.
Military activity in the Red Sea area       
Military activity is currently underway in response to attempts by Houthi militants to prevent movement of international shipping in the Red Sea. While the area of activity is limited to the Red Sea and Yemen, there is a possibility that Travel Advice for nearby countries could change at short notice. You should continue to monitor Travel Advice and follow any relevant instructions from local authorities.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.   
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Eritrea
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Eritrea, attacks cannot be ruled out.
Political situation
Local security measures
In September 2022, the Eritrean government announced a national call-up of militia in response to the conflict in northern Ethiopia. The call-up has now ended following the peace deal between the Ethiopian government and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). Extra security measures may still be in place around Asmara and other regions of Eritrea. Get advice from your host, accommodation or travel operator.
Armed civilians
A large proportion of the population has access to arms under the government of Eritrea’s civilian militia programme. The British Embassy has no evidence these weapons increase the threat of violent crime.
Travelling outside of Asmara     
Foreign nationals must apply in advance for a permit to travel outside Asmara’s surrounding province, Zoba Maekel. There are checkpoints outside Asmara where officials will check your travel permit. Applications for permits are handled by the relevant ministry:
Ministry of Trade and Industry for business travellers
Ministry of Tourism, Harnet Avenue, for tourists
Ministry of Foreign Affairs for diplomats
When applying, you must give details of the car you’ll be travelling in. There have been reports of authorities not allowing tourists to use public transport for travel outside of Asmara.
If you are living or working outside Asmara, you will also need a travel permit to leave your area of residence or work. Apply to the local region (‘zoba’) administration office. Applications may take several days to be processed and are not always successful.
Restrictions on travel by foreign nationals apply equally to foreign diplomats. Staff from the British Embassy cannot always give consular assistance in person to British nationals outside Asmara.
Crime
Protecting yourself and your belongings
Though Asmara is a relatively safe city, there is a risk of street crime, especially at night. To reduce your personal risk: 
do not walk alone at night
keep phones, cameras and passports out of sight
keep valuables somewhere secure, such as in a hotel safe
Laws and cultural differences
Personal ID
You must always carry ID. A copy of the photo page of your passport is enough. Keep the original and a second copy in a safe place.
Internet and phone access
Internet access is highly restricted in Eritrea, mainly limited to hotels and a small number of internet cafes. There is no 3G in the country. The national telephone networks are often unreliable and may only work for limited periods each day outside Asmara and larger towns.
International SIM cards will not work in Eritrea. You need a residence permit to buy a local SIM card and this can take several weeks. There have been unconfirmed reports that phone calls made on the Eritrean mobile network are recorded.
Using cameras in secure areas
Photographing government buildings and military installations is illegal. You need a permit to take photographs of the ‘tank graveyard’ in Asmara. You can apply for a permit at the Ministry of Tourism. Always ask if you want to take a photo in any area where security personnel are present.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual activity is illegal. If convicted, you can get a prison sentence.

Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Eritrea, see information on driving abroad.
You’ll need a 1949 version of the international driving permit (IDP) and your UK driving licence. Take both to the Ministry of Transportation and Communication and they will issue you with a driving permit.
You cannot get an IDP outside the UK so get one before you travel. Find your nearest post office branch that offers this service.
Road conditions
In Asmara, street lighting is limited by power cuts. Avoid travelling after dark during power cuts and in rural areas, where roads are unlit.
Road signage and safety barriers are scarce and road surfaces are uneven. Other drivers may drive without lights and some drive erratically or at speed. Tight blind bends and steep drops are common. In many parts of the country, roads are difficult or impassable during the rainy season.
Air travel
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in Eritrea that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority.
Check whether your tour operator has concerns about airlines in Eritrea.
Sea travel
Mariners must get permissions and entry visas before attempting to land in Eritrea.
You risk being detained if you go ashore on the south-western Hanish Islands or any other islands that belong to Eritrea. See regional risks.
Piracy risk
The Southern Red Sea area is a hotspot for maritime crime and security incidents.  
There is still a significant risk of piracy in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean, where piracy has been reduced but not prevented. The threat assessment of the combined international naval counter-piracy forces is that sailing yachts should not enter the designated high-risk area, due to the risk of hijacking.
