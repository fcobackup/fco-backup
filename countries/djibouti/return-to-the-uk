There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Djibouti as the Government of Djibouti suspended all commercial flights into and out of Djibouti and closed the borders.
Flights
There will be an Ethiopian Airlines special charter flight from Djibouti to Addis Ababa on 20 May. This will allow for onward flights to the UK by commercial means from Addis Ababa. If you are interested, you should go to or contact the Ethiopian Airlines ticket office in Djibouti at 11am on 16 May to secure a seat. The address of the ticket office is Place 27 Juin/Ras Mekennen, Djibouti City, Telephone +253 77463038 . You will need to show your onward ticket from Addis Ababa to the UK in order to board this plane in Djibouti. If you cannot leave Djibouti at this time, see advice on staying in Djibouti during coronavirus.
You should check travel advice for guidance on transiting via Ethiopia. If you are trying to get back to the UK and need financial help, see the FCO’s guide on financial assistance.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
