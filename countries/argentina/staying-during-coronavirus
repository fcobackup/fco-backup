This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Argentina as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Argentina to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Argentina
In Argentina, measures to control the spread of COVID-19 have been extended until at least midnight on 20 December. With the exception of the metropolitan area of Bariloche and Dina Huapi (Rio Negro province) and Puerto Deseado (Santa Cruz), which remain under mandatary social isolation (ie. lockdown), the rest of the country is now in a phase of mandatory social distancing. The restrictions imposed may vary between jurisdictions.
In all parts of Argentina you must cover your nose and mouth with a face mask or other garment whenever you go out in public.
Under mandatory social isolation, you must stay at home. You are allowed to travel to an airport if you have a flight booked and you can make single person journeys to buy necessities, such as medicines or foodstuffs, in your local area.
Under mandatory social distancing, free movement is allowed within each jurisdiction as long as social distancing rules are adhered to. The use of public transport within jurisdictions remains restricted to essential workers and those in need of medical treatment.
Movement between jurisdictions is permitted, provided you meet the requirements of the specific jurisdiction/province you plan to visit. Requirements might include taking a COVID-19 PCR test, applying for a permit to circulate (Certificado Único de Circulación) or a summer certificate (Certificado Verano) amongst others. You must check the requirements and protocols in place in each jurisdiction/province here (in Spanish) and make sure you meet them ahead of travelling. You could be subject to a financial penalty if you do not abide by local regulations.
As of 8 December, all arrivals into the City of Buenos Aires will have to take a COVID-19 test. Full details on this requirement are available in the City of Buenos Aires website (in Spanish).
Visas
The 90-day permission for tourists to stay in Argentina is being extended each month by 30 days, if your original 90 days expired after 17 March. The latest extension was announced on 18 November.
