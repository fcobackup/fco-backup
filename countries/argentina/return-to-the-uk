There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Argentina, and no direct flights. Borders remain open for departure, but there are only a limited number of exceptional international flights.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Argentina. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Argentine authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
