Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Seychelles
The Government of Seychelles has announced that, with effect from Monday 28th December, the United Kingdom will no longer feature on the list of countries from which visitors may travel to Seychelles.
Dual nationals, permanent residents and approved work permit holders may continue to travel from the United Kingdom to Seychelles but will be required to quarantine or self-isolate on arrival, subject to direction from the Public Health Authority. A COVID-19 test must also be performed no more than 48 hours before departure and you must be able to demonstrate a negative test result on entry.
The Government of Seychelles has advised that these measures will be in effect until the 31 January 2021 and will be subject to review before that date.
You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with all of the pre-entry preparations and conditions before you travel to Seychelles. The Ministry for Tourism in Seychelles has produced a travel advisory detailing the conditions of entry for visitors from countries with special status. You can access this at the Ministry for Tourism website.
Dual nationals, permanent residents and approved work permit holders currently in countries deemed high-risk may be permitted entry to Seychelles, but may be required to undergo facility-based quarantine, at their own expense, for 14 days. They must also provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test, produced no more than 72 hours before boarding their flight to Seychelles, regardless of the country from which they are travelling. An application for entry form should also be completed and returned to the Public Health Authority before travel. Work permit holders must also be cleared by the Department of Employment and Immigration. If you are uncertain of your status, you should contact the Department of Employment and Immigration before attempting to enter Seychelles.
Cruise ships from any country worldwide will not be permitted to berth in Seychelles until further notice.
Seychelles International Airport may allow private jets and commercial charter flights to land if they are carrying passengers who will then be transferred to authorised yachts, or to specifically authorised tourist facilities. All passengers must have proof of a negative COVID-19 test performed in the 48 hours prior to boarding. You should contact your airline and the Seychelles Department of Health to understand when and if you will be permitted entry to Seychelles.
Permission for yachts to enter Seychelles waters may be granted by the Public Health Commissioner. Permission for crew to disembark will not be granted until the vessel has spent at least 14 days at sea. If you intend to enter Seychelles waters and if you wish to disembark from a vessel, you are required to contact the Seychelles Department of Health before attempting to do so.
Screening on arrival
All passengers will be temperature checked at all ports of arrival. If symptoms of COVID-19 are found to be present, tests will be conducted. Those found to be positive will be quarantined and re-checked.
Quarantine requirements
Dual nationals and returning residents travelling from the UK will be required to quarantine or self-isolate on arrival. Individuals who have spent at least 14 days in a low or medium risk country before travelling to Seychelles may be permitted to self-isolate in their homes for up to 14 days upon entering Seychelles if they obtain approval from the Public Health Authority. Seychellois and returning residents travelling from high-risk countries may be permitted entry to Seychelles, but will be required to undergo quarantine at a government facility, at their own expense, for 14 days.
Regular entry requirements
The Government of Seychelles is reviewing its policies on work permits (Gainful Occupational Permits) for foreign nationals. Following the economic impact of the coronavirus, it is a possibility that GOPs for some foreign nationals will not be renewed. You should speak to your employer and contact the Government of Seychelles Department for Immigration and Civil Status if you hold a GOP and are concerned about your employment status in Seychelles.
Visas
Visas are not required for British passport holders.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Seychelles.
