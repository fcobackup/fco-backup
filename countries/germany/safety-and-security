Crime
Crime levels are broadly similar to the UK. Take sensible precautions to avoid mugging, bag snatching and pick pocketing. Be particularly vigilant at airports, railway stations and crowded public gatherings. Do not leave valuables unattended. If your passport has been stolen, you must go to the nearest police station and get a police report.
Road travel
In 2021 there were 2,562 road deaths in Germany (source: Department for Transport provisional figures). This equates to 3.1 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.4 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2021.

Licences and documents
If you wish to drive in Germany you must carry a valid driving licence, insurance and vehicle documents with you in the vehicle at all times. If the vehicle does not belong to the driver, written permission from the registered owner may also be requested. The minimum age for driving a car in Germany is 18.
If you’re taking your own vehicle, you will need a UK sticker. You might also need an international driving permit (IDP) to drive in some EU countries and Norway if you have:
a paper driving licence
a licence issued in the Isle of Man
The German Federal Transport Ministry has more information on the validity of non-German driving licences.
If you’re living in Germany, check the Living in Guide for information on requirements for residents.
Driving a British car abroad
You must display the UK identifier when driving a UK-registered vehicle abroad. Check Driving in the EU for more information.
Road safety
Driving regulations
There is an environmental zone (Umweltzone) in some inner city centres. Only vehicles meeting specific exhaust emission standards are allowed to enter the zone. See the websites of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety and the Federal Environmental Agency for further information.
It is illegal to take part in motor vehicle races or rallies on German roads.
See the European Commission, AA and  RAC guides on driving in Germany.
Skiing
You should follow all safety instructions given by the local authorities due to the danger of avalanches in some areas. Always check with the local tourist offices on current snow and weather conditions on arrival. Avalanche beepers (receivers) are the most common rescue devices and when properly used provide the fastest way of locating an avalanche victim. You can get information about the risk of an avalanche occurring from the European Avalanche Warning Service.
