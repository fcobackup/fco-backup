This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Slovenia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact Slovenia’s embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Slovenia.
Passport validity requirements
To travel to Slovenia, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
To enter Slovenia (and all Schengen countries) your passport must:
have a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive. Passports issued after 1 October 2018 are now valid for only 10 years, but for passports issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added if you renewed a passport early
have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave
Contact Slovenia’s embassy in the UK if your passport does not meet both these requirements.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document, or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Checks at border control
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
If you’re a visitor, your passport must be stamped when you enter or leave the Schengen area (which includes Slovenia). Border guards will use passport stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for stays in the Schengen area. If your passport was not stamped, border guards will presume you have overstayed the visa-free limit.
If your passport was not stamped, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.
Read about passport stamping if you live in Slovenia.
At Slovenian border control, you may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
From 21 October, temporary border checks will be introduced at Slovenia’s borders with Italy, Croatia and Hungary. Austrian border checks will continue.  You should allow extra time for crossing land borders from and in to Slovenia, and be ready to show your passport or residency card if you are asked to do so by the border police. Checks may also involve vehicle inspections.
Visa requirements
You can travel to the Schengen area (including Slovenia) for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:
as a tourist
to visit family or friends
to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events
for short-term studies or training
If you are travelling to Slovenia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
Applying for a visa
To stay longer than 90 days - to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons - you will need to meet the Slovenian government’s entry requirements. Check what you need to do to work in Slovenia. If you need a visa, you can apply online using Slovenian visa application forms.
Registration with the police
You must register with the police within 3 days of your arrival, but any registered hotel or guest house will do this for you. If you are staying in self-catering accommodation, or with friends or family, check registration arrangements with your booking agent or your host. If you do not register your presence in Slovenia, you could get a fine.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Slovenia guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Slovenia. For more information see Slovenia’s customs webpage on import of goods. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking food and drink into Slovenia
You cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions for medical reasons, for example certain amounts of powdered infant milk, infant food, or pet food. Check the rules about taking food and drink into the EU on the European Commission website.
If you’re travelling through Slovenia
Border control may ask you for proof that you have the means to leave Slovenia and enter a neighbouring country.
Entry via land border crossings with Croatia
Croatia joined the Schengen area on 1 January 2023. This means that all travellers in possession of a valid travel document can now cross from Slovenia into Croatia at any point along the border.
You can find further details on the Slovenian Police website.
