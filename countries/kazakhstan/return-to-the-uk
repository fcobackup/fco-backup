You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.

We are aware of a flight from Nur-Sultan to London Heathrow on Monday 13th April, with an earlier connecting flight from Almaty. We recommend anybody wishing to take advantage of this to contact Air Astana directly (+7 727 244 4477, or via their website www.airastana.com) to check the availability of tickets.
There are also other flights to Europe (but not currently the UK) from West Kazakhstan (Atyrau) on Air Astana.
There are currently extremely limited other commercial options available to return to the UK from Kazakhstan, due to border closures to help combat the Coronavirus outbreak.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Kazakhstan. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Kazakh authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you cannot leave Kazakhstan at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Kazakh authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Flights to various destinations may be announced at short notice and we recommend travellers contact individual airlines to see what routes they may be operating.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.
