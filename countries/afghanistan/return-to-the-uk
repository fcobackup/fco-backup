There is now a very reduced commercial airline service to and from Afghanistan and other countries. Remaining routes may be completely suspended at short or no notice. If you wish to return to the UK, you are strongly advised to return now, as commercial routes may otherwise not be available.
You should contact your airline or travel company and insurance provider as soon as you are able, and keep up to date with the latest developments. International travel has become significantly more difficult.
Please check with your carrier before travelling as many countries or areas are restricting travel at very short, or without, notice in response to the COVID-19
