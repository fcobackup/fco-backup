If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
International travel
Direct commercial flights to and from the UK to Uzbekistan restarted in August 2021, although they operate only twice per week. Flights to Frankfurt have also resumed and there is a daily flight to Istanbul. Check with your travel company or airline for the latest information.
Testing on departure
It may be necessary to obtain a ‘fit-to-fly’ negative PCR test to board flights at Tashkent Airport, dependent upon the country of next destination. Travellers should check the entry regulations at their destination and any transit points and obtain any required tests before travel.
Travel in Uzbekistan
The FCDO advises against all travel to the Termez region and to within 5km from the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan border.
Public transport in cities has resumed and train travel between regions is now operating.
Care should be taken if using taxis as some operators might not be fully complying with COVID-19 hygiene measures.
Under measures introduced by the Uzbek authorities, anyone subject to quarantine or self-isolation who breaches such controls is liable to a minimum fine of 11 Million UZS (approximately £900) or up to 10 years imprisonment.
Accommodation
Hotels, motels and guest houses have re-opened.
Public places and services
Shopping malls, clothing markets, restaurants, cafes, beauty salons and larger shops, as well as gyms, swimming pools, private kindergartens and education centres are open.
