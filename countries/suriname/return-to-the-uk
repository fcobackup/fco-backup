There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Guyana.
Suriname has closed its borders owing to concerns about the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). There are no longer flights from Suriname. All scheduled international flights to and from the country are suspended and land border and ferry crossings closed.
What to do
To build a more accurate picture of the number of non-resident British nationals still in Suriname, and the issues you are currently facing, we would ask all those with an interest in returning to the UK to email returnfrom.suriname@fco.gov.uk providing the following information:
Your full name(s);
Your passport details;
Expiry date of passport
Your date(s) of birth;
Place of birth (as shown on your passport)
Your exact current location in Suriname;
Details of the best way to contact you.
Any exceptional international flights will depart from Paramaribo. If you are catching one of these flights please leave plenty of time to get to the airport and make sure you have the following documents (printed where possible):
proof of a booked flight (ideally a boarding pass)
your passport
If you cannot leave Suriname at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
Future travel plans
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Suriname. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Surinamese authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.
Where possible, the British High Commission in Guyana, which covers Suriname, will share relevant information about departure options on Facebook
