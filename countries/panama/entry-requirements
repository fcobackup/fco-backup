This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Panama set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Embassy and Consulate of Panama in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Panama.
Passport validity requirements
If you’re visiting Panama, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you plan to leave Panama.
If you live in Panama, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you arrive.
Your passport must have at least one blank page.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
 Checks at border control
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
Make sure immigration officials properly stamp your passport with the date you arrived the country.
At Panamanian border control, you may need to:
give the address of your accommodation and a contact telephone number
show a return or onward ticket – particularly if you arrive by land from Costa Rica and are not a legal resident of Costa Rica
prove you have at least 500 US dollars (or the same amount in other currencies) or a credit card
Visa requirements
You can visit Panama for up to 3 months without a visa if you arrive by land or air. There are different visa requirements for sea arrivals.
You cannot normally extend your stay, unless you apply to change your immigration status (for example, for business purposes or marriage) within the 3 months.
If you try to extend your stay by visiting a neighbouring country and returning to Panama, immigration officials may detain you. The British Embassy cannot intervene in decisions made by Panama’s immigration officials.
If you arrive by sea
If you arrive on a vessel that is not a cruise ship, you must have a visa to enter Panama. You must pay a fee of 100 US dollars, plus 5 US dollars registration, for each passenger or crew member. There may be other fees, for example for cruising permits.
If you arrive on a cruise ship or are travelling through the Panama Canal, you do not need a visa unless you are staying in Panama for more than 3 months. Immigration authorities will stamp your passport if you leave the ship. They do not board cruise ships travelling through the canal to check passports.
Applying for a visa
If you need a visa, apply through the Embassy and Consulate of Panama in the UK. They can give you more information on entry requirements.
For information on extending your stay, check with the Panama National Migration Service (in Spanish).
Airport tax
There is a charge of 40 US dollars on departure. This is usually included in your airline ticket fare. Check with your airline.
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Panama guide.
Depending on your circumstances, this may include a yellow fever vaccination certificate.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Panama. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
