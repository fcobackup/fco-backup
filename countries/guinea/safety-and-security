Political situation
Although the political situation in Guinea has stabilised following the closely contested presidential elections on 11 October 2015, there are ongoing political tensions. These have led to sporadic violent demonstrations in the capital with demonstrators blocking roads near the airport. There has also been social and political unrest in the Boke mining region. Monitor local media reports and keep away from large demonstrations.
Crime
Motorists have encountered theft at gun point, particularly at night. These crimes are often carried out by individuals dressed in police or military uniforms and carrying military weapons. There have been incidents of violent car-jackings, especially in the outlying suburbs of Conakry. Burglaries and break-ins are common.
There are regular reports of robberies on the route Mamou, Faranah, Kissidougou, Guekedou, Macenta, Nzerekore. The British Embassy is aware of unconfirmed reports of police extorting cash from foreigners and Guineans.
If you plan to arrive in Conakry on a flight after dark you should arrange your airport transfer before you travel.
Those involved in trading gold and diamonds should take particular care; this trade attracts criminal gangs, who are known to resort to kidnapping and extortion. Trading scams involving diamonds, gold export and gold certification have been reported.
Those who commit criminal offences, including gem smuggling, can expect to be subjected to local law. There are heavy penalties for those convicted. Local prison conditions are harsh with food and water often not supplied on a regular basis. Pre-trial detention is extensive and can last for many months.
The local police number for downtown Conakry is (+224) 622 039 258.
Local travel
Areas of Guinea bordering Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone are often tense with an increased military presence.
Road travel
Road travel is hazardous during the rainy season from May to October. Torrential rains can cause floods and landslides. Monitor local weather reports and expect difficulties when travelling to affected areas during this season. Avoid travel outside cities after dark.
Taxis and long distance buses are poorly maintained, and the drivers often unqualified. Few motorists have any form of insurance. Most major hotels and travel agencies offer cars for hire, with a chauffeur if required.
The standard of road maintenance is low. Beware of deep potholes. Many roads are not metalled and are not repaired after the rainy season. Roads within Conakry and other principal towns can quickly become flooded and impassable.  
Supplies of fuel may run low from time to time; it is worth considering carrying an emergency stock, especially when making a long journey.
Police and local militia maintain checkpoints across the country. Vehicles and passengers are submitted to checks on documentation and baggage. Corruption and extortion are common at roadblocks. Occasionally, checkpoints can be a pretext for armed robbery.
Air travel
We do not have reliable information about safety and/or maintenance standards of local airlines, but flights are frequently delayed or cancelled.
If you plan to arrive in Conakry on a flight after dark you should arrange your airport transfer before you travel. Corruption at the airport by officials is common.
Sea travel
There have been reports of attacks of piracy and armed robbery against ships in Guinean territorial waters.
