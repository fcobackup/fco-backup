Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Gabon. The Gabonese authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The Gabonese authorities have announced restrictions on all international flights, which restrict each airline to one flight per week until further notice. All land borders have been closed indefinitely. Visa applications for individuals travelling from counties affected by coronavirus, including the UK, have been suspended until further notice.
Visitors arriving from countries affected by coronavirus, including the UK, will be required to self-isolate for a minimum of 15 days on arrival. Individuals testing positive for coronavirus, or who have come into contact with anyone who has tested positive, will be required to enter quarantine in a government-run facility.
Gatherings of more than 30 people have been banned.
Failure to comply with the measures above would constitute a criminal offence.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities and keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Gabonese Embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
