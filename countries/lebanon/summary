There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, but cases have been confirmed in other countries, including Lebanon. See Health
On 12 March the Lebanese Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGCA) issued a circular which advised the following:
Immediate cancellation of all flights from China, Italy, South Korea, Iran.
That all airlines flying to Beirut Rafic Hariri Airport do not board passengers who have been in the UK, France, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Germany and Spain. This will affect those boarding direct flights from those countries, and those transiting through third countries to Lebanon. This decision came into force at 0000 on 13 March.
That Lebanese Nationals, those with Lebanese Residency, or those who are a member of a family of a Lebanese National can return to Lebanon from the affected countries up to, and including, 16 March.
Direct flights from the affected countries will then be suspended from 17 March, with the decision reviewed on 23 March.
There are exceptions for Diplomats and those working for International Organisations accredited to Lebanon until 17 March.
There may be further restrictions to entry and exit requirements to Lebanon, or flight options, at short notice, and if you have visited an affected country you may be denied entry at the border or asked to self-isolate for 14 days. From 17 March, direct flights to and from Lebanon from the countries listed above are suspended. Travel restrictions in others countries may also prevent you from transiting via third countries when travelling to and from Lebanon.
There are also restrictions on entry in effect at the Lebanese land border with Syria. Exemptions may be in place for Diplomats, those working for International Organisations accredited to Lebanon, Lebanese Nationals, those with Lebanese Residency, or those who are a member of a family of a Lebanese National until 16 March.
UK nationals are therefore strongly advised to immediately review travel plans to Lebanon, and contact their nearest Lebanese Embassy, airline and/or travel agency for further details.
The Government of Lebanon has also announced significant restrictions on movement, events, public and private spaces within Lebanon. Travellers are advised to comply with local restrictions.
Protests which began on 17 October 2019 are ongoing. The protests have centred on Beirut and Tripoli, but have occurred at various locations nationwide, often with little notice. Violent confrontations between protesters, security forces and supporters of political groups have occurred. As a result of the protests, major roads (including to and from Beirut airport) have become blocked, there have been short notice closures of banks and petrol stations, and medical supplies may become increasingly scarce.

Following the attack on the coalition base at Taji in Iraq on 11 March, and subsequent US airstrikes, tensions may be raised across the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests, including against UK citizens. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and this travel advice.
The security situation in parts of Lebanon can deteriorate quickly. A conflict with Israel could spark with little warning with a rapid escalation in violence. This included an exchange of fire between the militant group Hizballah and the Israeli Defence Force across the Blue Line in the South of Lebanon on 1 September 2019. See Security situation
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Lebanon. You should be vigilant at all times, avoid crowds and crowded places and follow the advice of the Lebanese authorities.On 3 June 2019, a suspected terrorist killed two Lebanese army soldiers and one Lebanese policeman in Tripoli. The attacker died in the subsequent operation by the Lebanese security agencies. Be particularly vigilant at this time. See Terrorism
There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.
Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Terrorist Asset-Freezing Act 2010. Offences committed under the act – including funding and supporting proscribed organisations – may be liable to prosecution in the UK.
There are unexploded ordnance and land mines in many places. You should avoid travelling away from established paths, especially when hiking. This is particularly a concern in southern Lebanon. See Local travel
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Lebanon where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
