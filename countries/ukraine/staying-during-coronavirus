This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Ukraine as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Ukraine to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Ukraine
For information on entering Ukraine, see Entry Requirements.
Coronavirus measures have included the closure of schools, universities, non-essential shops and restaurants, suspension of public transport, restrictions on public gatherings of more than 10 people and the compulsory wearing of face masks in shops.
Some restrictions have recently been lifted. Shops, open air cafes, takeaway services, beauty salons and hairdressers, museums, libraries, household service centres, shoe repairers, dentists, auditors, attorneys and notaries are now allowed to operate. Parks and recreation areas have also reopened, and groups of up to 8 people are allowed to gather there.
Other restrictions are being eased in some regions, depending on the number of cases of coronavirus present and other criteria set out by the Ministry of Health. Public transport is resuming in cities and inter-regional train travel will restart from 1 June. The reopening of airports will only be considered after 15 June.
Failure to comply with the restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence.
Visas
Where the restrictions on travel and availability of government services mean that foreigners stay in Ukraine beyond the period permitted by their visa-free limit or visa validity, or that they are unable to extend residence permits, there will be no penalties imposed.
Health
If you have COVID-19 symptoms, such as a dry cough, respiratory difficulties, and a high temperature, you should:
if you have insurance or a private medical provider in Ukraine, seek assistance from them in the first instance
if you do not have insurance or your symptoms are more severe, call an ambulance on 103. Please note that the ambulance service may not have English-speaking operators available. In this case, please enlist the help of a Ukrainian or Russian-speaking friend, family member, hotel worker etc to help you call the ambulance
In both cases, you are likely to be advised to self-isolate, or be taken to a hospital where you will be tested for coronavirus. In case of a positive diagnosis, please inform the British Embassy Kyiv by calling +380 44 490 3660 or by completing this web contact form, or ask a friend or relative to contact us on your behalf.
If taken to hospital, you are likely to be tested for coronavirus. The choice of hospital will depend on your location and the availability of hospitals and/or beds.
British nationals should receive medical treatment free of charge within Ukraine’s state healthcare system for suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 – please speak to your insurance company to determine if you are covered for the cost of any treatment at a private clinic, or treatment for any other illness.
If you come into contact with someone who is confirmed to have COVID-19, or has COVID-19 symptoms, you must self-isolate for 14 days. Contact your insurer or private medical provider, or call an ambulance on 103, should you develop symptoms yourself. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Ukraine, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

You can find more information about the situation in Ukraine on the website of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine (in English) and Ukrainian, or by calling the Cabinet of Ministers COVID19 hotline on +38 (0)800 505 201.
