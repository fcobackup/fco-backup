Typhoon Season
Meteorologists predict that tropical storms could be more forceful and more frequent during this year’s typhoon season (September - November). There is a risk of falling trees, damage to buildings and transport infrastructure, landslides and flooding, in particular in the central region (including the tourist areas of Da Nang, Hoi An, Hue and Phong Nha) and northern regions (including the tourist areas of Ha Giang, Sa Pa, Red River Delta, Ha Long). High river levels may affect the Mekong Delta in the south. Check local guidance before travelling.
