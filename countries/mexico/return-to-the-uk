There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Mexico.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Mexico, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Various options remain to travel to the UK via the USA and Canada. Please review our travel advice for any country you intend to transit or enter before booking any flights.
Restrictions
Please note that some airlines are imposing their own additional restrictions on travelers, different from the Mexican government guidelines. These restrictions may apply for domestic and international flights. Review the airline requirements carefully before purchasing any flights and before you travel.
The land border between the US and Mexico will close at midnight on Saturday 21st March to all non-essential traffic for 30 days. This closure applies primarily to tourism and recreational travel. Cargo, trade and healthcare workers will still be able to cross the border. Please check with your closest US Embassy/Consulate before attempting to cross the border.
