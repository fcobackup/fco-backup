Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Maldives
Those who have completed vaccination doses can travel internally to islands and check-in to guesthouses without a PCR test.
Tourists (including accompanying vaccine ineligible children) who have not completed the full dosage of vaccination, will be allowed to check-in to guest houses on local islands, if and when the following vaccination requirements are met in the guesthouse island:
(a) 60% of the island’s total population have completed 14 days since receiving the full dosage of vaccination
(b) 95% of the tourism related service providers in the island have completed 14 days since receiving the full dosage of vaccination
(c) 90% of the individuals above the age of 65 (sixty-five) living in the island have completed 14 days since receiving the full dosage of vaccination
Vaccination coverage of guest-house islands are published and updated by Health Protection Agency, with information provided by the Island authorities.
You will be regarded as having completed doses only after 14 days have passed since you received the recommended dose(s) of a WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccine, or vaccines approved by the Maldives Food and Drug Authority.
Tourists can travel between islands and resorts that do not have COVID-19 cases and are not subject to monitoring for COVID-19 as normal
Accommodation
Resorts, guesthouses and city hotels are open for tourists.
Public places and services
Wearing face mask is no longer mandatory in islands and areas without COVID-19 outbreaks. It is recommended that you wear a mask:
if you have flu like symptoms
in services where crowding takes place
in transport vehicles where many people travel and when using public transportation

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Maldives
We will update this page when the Government of the Maldives announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Maldives national vaccination programme started in February 2021 and is using the AstraZeneca and Sinopharm vaccines. From 15 January 2022, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is being administered as a booster dose for those over 18 who have completed their second COVID-19 vaccine at least six months previously. The Government of the Maldives has stated that resident British nationals over 12 years old are eligible for vaccination, if they choose to join the programme. All residents are requested to register on the My Health Portal where you can also book an appointment for vaccinations. Daily updates on vaccine centres are updated by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on their Twitter. The Maldivian authorities have published FAQ on vaccines.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in the Maldives, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
