The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advise against all travel to Afghanistan. We recognise that commercial flights are not currently operating. We will contact British nationals who we are in touch with, with information of any flights we become aware of. If you are safely able to leave Afghanistan by other means, you should do so immediately.
We have temporarily suspended most operations at the British Embassy in Kabul in response to the deterioration in the security situation. The embassy site has relocated. FCDO consular assistance can only be provided remotely and is therefore extremely limited.
If you are in need of assistance, you should call +44 (0)1908 516666 and select the option “Consular services for British nationals”. You can also email help@fco.gov.uk.
COVID-19 entry restrictions for Afghanistan
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Afghanistan’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
Returning to the UK
Afghanistan is on the red list for entering England. Check what you must do to enter England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
The level of consular assistance the FCDO can provide in Afghanistan is extremely limited. Commercial flights are not operating at this time. Do not rely on the FCDO being able to evacuate you from Afghanistan in an emergency. In arranging your departure from Afghanistan, check your travel documents are up to date and that you have the necessary visas for onward travel.
Staff from the British Embassy will not be able to travel outside of Kabul due to the security situation; this severely limits the consular assistance that can be offered. Travel by road throughout the country, but particularly outside the capital Kabul, is extremely dangerous. Seek professional security advice for all travel and consider using armoured vehicles.
If you plan to travel to Afghanistan against FCDO advice, then find out what you need to know about coronavirus in Afghanistan in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
For information about COVID-19 vaccines, see the Coronavirus page.
Hotels and guesthouses used by foreign nationals and the government of Afghanistan are subject to regular threats. The British Embassy doesn’t allow official visitors to stay in hotels overnight and has placed restaurants and other venues off limits to staff. Make sure your accommodation is secure and review your security measures regularly.

You should note an overall increased threat to Western interests in Kabul. Follow the instructions of local authorities. There is a high threat of kidnapping throughout the country. See Terrorism

You can contact the emergency services by calling 119 (police and ambulance) and 112 (fire). They are unlikely to speak English.
