The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
However, if the UK leaves the European Union with no deal, the passport validity rules for travel to most countries in Europe will change from 29 March 2019. Before booking travel, you should check that your passport will meet these new rules and find out whether you need to renew it.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Germany.
Visas
British Citizens don’t need a visa to enter Germany. If you hold a different type of British nationality, check entry requirements with the German Embassy.
Stays of longer than three months
If you intend to work or study in Germany you must register with the German authorities (Einwohnermeldeamt) within 3 months of arrival. There is no longer a requirement for EU citizens to apply for a residence permit.  
Working in Germany
If you intend to work in Germany, you should get detailed information on employment regulations from the German Embassy.
