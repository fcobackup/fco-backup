If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Guinea, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
Guinea’s borders are closed for 30 days from 27 March. Conakry airport is officially closed to commercial passenger flights, but there remain occasional commercial options with Air France.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating.
What to do
We know the closure of borders and limited commercial options is concerning for British people trying to leave Guinea. The UK Government is working closely with airlines, the Guinean authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
for now, you should find secure accommodation
you can contact airlines to check flight options to the UK via third countries, although these are very limited. You should check the travel advice for all countries on your planned journey
