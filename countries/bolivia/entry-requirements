This page has information on travelling to Bolivia.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Bolivia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Bolivia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.

Tourists must have a hotel or hostel booking on arrival for their first night in Bolivia.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel

Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visitor visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to visit Bolivia. The length of stay permitted on entering Bolivia is initially 90 days. 30 day stamps are often given, but you are allowed to stay for 90 days at no extra charge. The Department of Immigration has imposed an annual limit for tourists of 90 days in Bolivia without a visa. If you want to stay for a longer period seek advice from the Bolivian Embassy in London or the Department of Immigration office in La Paz at Avenida Camacho No. 1468. If only one parent is travelling with a child, you cannot stay for longer than 90 days. If you stay for more than 90 days, the child will need a judicial permit to leave Bolivia with only one parent.
Make sure you get an entry stamp when you arrive in Bolivia, otherwise you’ll have to pay a fine to leave. If you enter Bolivia overland, make sure your passport is stamped on both sides of the border, with an exit stamp from the country you are leaving and an entry stamp on the Bolivian side - you may need to ask for directions to the immigration office. Bolivia no longer stamps passports on the Argentian border but you need to register your exit on the Argentinian website which passes the information to Bolivian immigration. The British Embassy can’t intervene in immigration issues.
Residence permits and other types of visas
The Bolivian Immigration authority (Dirección General de Migración) has introduced new procedures and requirements for British nationals applying for residence permits and other types of visas in Bolivia. New requirements now include a police certificate of criminal records from the UK, which you can get from the Association of Chief Police Officers website. If you need any documents from the UK, get them translated into Spanish and legalised at the Foreign Commonwealth and Development office in London.
Visit the Bolivian Immigration authority for more information.
