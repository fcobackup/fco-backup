Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) has been updating its guidance on epidemic prevention measures on a continual basis. In line with the CECC’s general guidelines, the Taiwanese authorities have advised that further localised epidemic prevention measures may be introduced in certain cities or counties depending on the COVID-19 situation in each location.
For the month of October, the following measures are now in place:
Face masks should be worn at all times when outdoors. Exceptions are permitted when exercising, consuming food and beverages and when in certain open spaces e.g. forests, mountains and beaches
Social distancing must be maintained in public areas
Restaurants will permitted to offer dine-in services provided they adhere to Ministry of Health and Welfare regulations
Enhanced epidemic measures will be introduced for certain leisure and entertainment venues

You will be required to present a COVID-19 vaccination record in order to enter certain entertainment venues, including singing and dancing venues, discos, nightclubs, clubs, hostess bars, pubs, and beauty parlours (tourist parlours and audio-video parlours).
Venues will accept the paper-based “Yellow Card,” vaccination record on the Taiwanese National Health Insurance app, and the Digital COVID-19 Certificate introduced in January 2022.
