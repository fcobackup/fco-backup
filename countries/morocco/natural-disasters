Morocco is in an earthquake zone. Minor earthquakes occur occasionally. A strong earthquake hit northern Morocco around the port town of Al Hoceima in 2004, killing more than 600 people. Familiarise yourself with general safety procedures in the event of an earthquake and take note of any instructions in hotel rooms.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
Heavy rain can cause flash flooding in some areas, particularly in the mountains or near rivers during winter months. Walking and driving can be dangerous in flooded areas. If flooding does occur in your area, listen to local media and follow the instructions of the local authorities.
