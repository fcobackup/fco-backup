There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, but cases have been confirmed in other countries, including Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Bosnian authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures, including forbidding entry at borders to foreign nationals travelling from Italy, Iran, South Korea, and the province of Hubei and city of Wuhan in China. Travelers from Germany, France and Spain are being instructed to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival, though passengers who just transited through those three European countries are not required to self-isolate. As of 16 March, all travellers entering BiH will be instructed to self-isolate for fourteen days. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Some border crossing points into Bosnia and Herzegovina are closed. Many schools are now closed. See Health
