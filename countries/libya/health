Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Libya.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 1415 and ask for an ambulance.
Medical help in remote areas may not be available. Even if your travel or insurance company has arrangements with an international air ambulance provider, they may not be allowed to carry out a rescue operation within Libya. The current status of Libyan rescue services is uncertain.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Vaccine recommendations and health risks
At least 8 weeks before your trip:
check the latest vaccine recommendations for Libya
see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page
See what health risks you’ll face in Libya, including:
leishmaniasis
Rift Valley fever
West Nile virus
schistosomiasis
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare in Libya
Healthcare in Libya is generally below the standard available in the UK. There are acute shortages of skilled personnel and medical supplies, particularly for chronic conditions such as diabetes. There are private clinics in Tripoli.
If you need treatment you may be evacuated to Malta or mainland Europe. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
Travel and mental health
Read FCDO guidance on travel and mental health. There is also mental health guidance on TravelHealthPro.
