Moving around in El Salvador
For information on entering El Salvador, see Entry Requirements
A state of emergency has been declared. This suspends some freedoms of assembly and movement. A 24/7 national curfew is in place until 21 May, with exceptions only for designated essential workers. Anyone leaving their accommodation must wear a mask. Movement between municipalities is no longer permitted and public transport (including taxis) has been suspended.
The Government has encouraged municipalities to introduce further measures. You should familiarise yourself with any additional measures in your local area. You should comply with these and other emergency measures. Hundreds of people have been detained and sent to quarantine facilities for breaking the curfew and stricter controls have been introduced from 7 May.
Key services (including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, petrol stations and home delivery food outlets) will operate. One individual per household can go out to buy essential supplies from outlets within the municipality in which they live on designated days according to the final digit of their Salvadoran identity document or, in the case of foreigners, residency or passport; shops are checking compliance on entry. Schools and universities and many other businesses and organisations, including restaurants and take away food services, are closed.
Quarantine
Following confirmation of the first COVID-19 case on 18 March, President Bukele announced that anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 would be required to receive care in a Government designated facility, to reduce the risk of transmission.
