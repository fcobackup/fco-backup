On 15 April, the Belgian Government announced an extension of existing measures to 3 May.
Entry and Borders
Entry and exit checks on the Belgian border have been reintroduced, in order to prevent non-essential travel. The Ministry of the Interior has indicated that all travellers to Belgium will be expected to produce either a Belgian ID (residence) card or a letter from their employer to prove that their travel is essential. Those who are transiting through Belgium should carry valid ID/proof of residence for the destination country and evidence of onward travel. Those who are attempting to travel for non-essential reasons will not be granted entry. Check here for details on what is classified as essential travel.
All international arrivals are being instructed to self-quarantine at home. There are some limited exemptions, notably for passengers transiting Belgium to return to their country of residence. Details are available from the Belgian government.
