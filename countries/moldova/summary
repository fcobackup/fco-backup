Most visits to Moldova are trouble free.
You should be alert to the possibility of political protests and demonstrations. While these are generally peaceful, the situation could quickly change. Be alert to the latest developments and take extra care. You should avoid large crowds, remain vigilant and follow local security advice.
From 9am local time on 28 November until 26 December 2018, Ukraine is imposing martial law in several of its oblasts (regions). Two of these oblasts (Odesa and Vinnytsia) border with the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova. More information is available in our travel advice for Ukraine.
If you visit Transnistria you should be aware that the region is outside of the control of the Moldovan authorities, and the consular assistance the British Embassy can provide may be severely limited. See Transnistria
The Moldovan authorities strictly enforce penalties (including deportation) against those who overstay. See Entry requirements
You should be vigilant to petty crime, particularly in Chisinau. Leave your passport, travel documents and other valuable items in a safe place, and carry a photocopy of your passport for identification purposes. See Crime
There are strong penalties for possession or use of drugs. Avoid taking photographs of military or government installations. See Local laws and customs
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Moldova, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
The British Embassy, Chisinau is monitoring the situation in Ukraine closely. At present there appears to be no immediate threat of the destabilisation spreading to Moldova, and there is no information suggesting an increased threat to British citizens or businesses in Moldova.
