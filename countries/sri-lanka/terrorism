Terrorists are very likely to carry out attacks in Sri Lanka. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.
On 21 April 2019, bombs were used to attack three churches and three hotels in Sri Lanka, in central Colombo; in the northern suburb of Colombo Kochchikade, and in Negombo roughly twenty miles north of Colombo; and in the east of the country in Batticaloa. There have been significant casualties.
The Sri Lankan authorities have stepped up security across the island, declaring a nationwide State of Emergency and curfew. Security operations are ongoing, including controlled explosions of suspicious packages and vehicles, and temporary evacuations of buildings. These may continue for a number of days. You should remain vigilant, follow the advice of local security authorities, avoid crowded public areas and gatherings/demonstrations, and keep up-to-date with developments.
Thereâ€™s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
