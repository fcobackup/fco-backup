Large events have been suspended including family, cultural, sporting, scientific and other commemorative events. Citizens are being encouraged to remain at home as far as possible and limit contact with other people.
You should consider making arrangements for provisions if you are unable or unwilling to leave your home for an extended period of time.

If you are unwell and suspect you have symptoms of Coronavirus you can call Kyrgyzstan’s medical hotline (112, 103, 118), or the hotlines of local medical services. If you are required to enter a state quarantine center facilities are likely to be basic.
