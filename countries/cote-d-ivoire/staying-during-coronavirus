This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Côte d’Ivoire as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Côte d’Ivoire to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Côte d’Ivoire
The government has declared a state of emergency until 15 May.
This bans all movement of people to and from Abidjan. For the purpose of the government decree, “Abidjan” includes the District of Abidjan, Dabou, Azaguie, Bingerville, Grand-Bassam, Bonoua, Assinie and up to PK30 on the Abidjan-Yamoussoukro motorway.
The decree provides an exemption for people transporting food supplies, medical and pharmaceutical products, medical evacuations, gas and fuel deliveries, as well as water, electricity, telephony and emergency services.

Visas
If you are already in Cote d’Ivoire and your visa is about to expire, for a fee you can apply for an extension in person to the Sûreté Nationale office in the Plateau district in Abidjan. Opening hours are from 8 am to 2 pm Monday to Friday. You will also need a completed application form and a passport photograph. If you are coming from outside Abidjan, you will need a government exemption.
