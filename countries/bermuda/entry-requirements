Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bermuda
All visitors from a country classified by the WHO as having community transmission of COVID-19 (including the UK) will need to apply for a Bermuda COVID-19 Travel Authorisation before departure. Travel Authorisation Applications need to be purchased 1 to 3 days before travel to permit review of the application and supporting documents. By applying for a Travel Authorisation, visitors and residents agree to comply with Bermuda’s quarantine and public health laws instructions at all times.
All visitors arriving by air or sea to Bermuda must be fully vaccinated. This does not apply to persons younger than 18 years and crew. Vaccinated air travellers may get either a PCR or antigen test as a pre-arrival test. All crew members, unvaccinated travellers and travellers arriving by sea must get a PCR test. A valid pre-arrival test must meet the standards as set out on the Government of Bermuda’s website.
Bermuda residents applying for travel authorisation who have left Bermuda 72 hours prior or less can use their outbound test for re-entry to Bermuda.
All immunised travellers will be given a red wristband upon arrival. Immunised travellers with pre-test must wear it until receiving the negative arrival test. Immunised travellers without pre-test must wear until receiving the negative Day 4 test. All unimmunised children travelling with an immunised parent/guardian will be given a red wristband upon arrival, which must be worn until receiving Day 4 test result.
Unimmunised travellers must complete their mandatory 14 day quarantine at an accommodation of their choice (at home or other accommodation). For further information, you should visit the Government of Bermuda website.
You must wear face masks when travelling to the departure airport and practice social distancing at the departure airport.
Upon arrival, you must show a copy of your Travel Authorisation and present a copy of the pre-departure PCR COVID-19 negative test result to health officers on request.
All travellers will undergo PCR COVID-19 testing at the Bermuda L.F. Wade International Airport. It is important that you adhere to the COVID-19 guidance and quarantine in your accommodation until airport test results are ready. Failure to adhere to guidelines could result in a fine of up to $25,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment. Expedited arrival testing is available for purchase for vaccinated travellers (both visitor and resident) for $100. This guarantees arrival PCR test results within four (4) hours. A limited number of expedited tests are available for purchase each day.
