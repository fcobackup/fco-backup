There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Liberia. Given the rise of the number of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) the Government of Liberia has announced the suspension of all commercial flights (except cargo, charter and special flights). Currently there are no scheduled passenger services to Liberia. Special charter flights are allowed with prior permission; cargo flights are still permitted.
Currently all land borders (with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire) are closed to travellers.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Liberia. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Liberian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.

This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM).
