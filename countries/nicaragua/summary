Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Nicaragua’s current entry restrictions and requirements. Entry rules may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check your cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
There is no British Embassy or Consulate in Nicaragua. Our ability to provide consular support there is severely limited. If you lose your passport, or it runs out of validity, replacement passports and Emergency Travel Documents cannot be issued within Nicaragua. You would need to make your own arrangements for it to be collected for you from a British Embassy in another country. The nearest British Embassy is in San Jose in Costa Rica. If you need emergency consular assistance, you should contact the British Embassy in San Jose, Costa Rica, at +506-2258-2025.
If you need to contact the emergency services in Nicaragua, call 118 (police), 128 (ambulance) or 115 (911 from a mobile) (fire).
Stay away from all demonstrations and gatherings, even if apparently peaceful, as these could result in outbreaks of violence. See Political situation.
The hurricane season usually runs from June to November. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation and the US National Hurricane Centre. See Natural disasters. See our tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you are caught up in a storm.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Nicaragua, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
