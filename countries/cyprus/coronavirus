Travel in Cyprus
Following policy changes announced by the Republic of Cyprus Government and the administration in the north, all crossing points between the Republic and the north are effectively closed to travellers.
Public spaces and services
The use of a face mask is compulsory in all indoor and outdoor public spaces in the Republic of Cyprus and there is a country-wide curfew from 9pm to 5am (some exceptions apply). Failure to comply with restrictions may result in a €300 fine. Shopping malls are closed until 8 February and there is a ban on visits to other households which will be lifted from 1 February to allow for visits from a maximum of two relatives and from 8 February for four visitors maximum.
From 5am on 10 January, until further notice, all outings from your place of residence require permission granted either by sending an SMS to “8998” from a Cypriot mobile number, or by completing and carrying a written form if you do not have a Cypriot phone number (or are over 65 and prefer this method). You are also required to carry official identification at all times. Public gatherings of more than two persons (children exempt) are banned.
Ancient sites, museums, cinemas, theatres and retail stores and catering and entertainment venues will also be closed from 10 January to 7 February. Shops offering essential goods and services, including supermarkets, bakeries, pharmacies, gas stations etc. remain open. From opening hours to 10am (local) they will only be serving people over 65 years of age or those in vulnerable groups.
