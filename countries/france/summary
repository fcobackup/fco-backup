Some protests linked to the yellow vest (gilets jaunes) movement continue across France, generally taking place on Saturdays.
If demonstrations do turn violent, a heavy police/gendarmerie presence is to be expected. Motorists travelling through France may continue to experience some delays or blockages caused by local demonstrators - you should drive with caution as protestors may be present on roads, motorways and toll booths. In all cases, you should avoid demonstrations wherever possible and follow the advice of the local authorities.

There remain some migrants around Calais, who may seek to enter the UK illegally. There have been instances of migrants seeking to slow down traffic on approach roads to ports, including by placing obstacles on the Calais Port approach road. If this happens you should keep moving where it’s safe to do so, or stop and call 112 if isn’t safe to proceed (keeping car doors locked).

Check the French government’s advice about what to do if a terrorist attack occurs. See Terrorism
