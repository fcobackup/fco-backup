This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Lesotho’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Lesotho set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Lesotho High Commission Lesotho in the UK.
All visitors to Lesotho must travel through South Africa, whether travelling by air or land. You need to meet South Africa’s entry requirements.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Lesotho, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 90 days after the date you arrive.
Make sure you get your passport stamped.
You need at least 4 blank pages for passport stamping. Lesotho border control need to stamp your passport and so do South African border control on your way to and from Lesotho.   
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements 
You can visit Lesotho for up to 90 days without a visa.
You can extend your stay by completing a 90-day temporary permit extension form and taking it to the Visa Application Centre in the Manthabiseng Convention Centre, Maseru. Your passport will need to be valid for the extension period.  
If you overstay without permission, the authorities may detain you and will charge you weekly fines.   
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Lesotho guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Lesotho. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.  
Taking money into Lesotho
Declare cash or travellers cheques in any currency if the value is 25,000 Lesotho loti or more. If you do not, the authorities could seize your money when you leave and you could be fined.  
The Lesotho loti is pegged to the South African rand on a one-to-one basis. Both currencies are accepted throughout Lesotho.
UK debit and credit cards are widely accepted for payment and at ATMs. If you are travelling outside Maseru, take enough cash to cover local purchases.
