Travel in the Philippines
Measures have been introduced by the Philippine government to prevent the spread of coronavirus; these differ across the country. The National Capital Region (Metro Manila), Bacolod, Batangas, Iloilo City and Tacloban are subject to General Community Quarantine (GCQ) measures. The rest of the Philippines is under Modified General Community Quarantine (MGCQ). However, changes can be made at short notice so you should monitor the status in your local area.
Non-essential travel, including for tourist purposes, is now permitted between GCQ and MGCQ regions. There may be entry requirements imposed from region to region so you should check with the relevant local authority.
Metro Manila is currently subject to a curfew from midnight to 4am with the exception of Navotas City which has curfew hours of 8pm to 4am.
Some cities are imposing age restrictions on people permitted to leave their residence for non-essential reasons. These vary by region so you should familiarise yourself with the requirements in your local area.
The wearing of face shields while on public transport is now mandatory. This includes but is not limited to trains, buses, jeepneys, taxis, boats and ships. The order also includes aeroplanes. You should check with your airline in advance whether they will provide a shield or whether you need to bring your own.
You should closely monitor announcements from local authorities to understand the latest restrictions and regulations where you’re situated, and their impact on your ability to travel and access essential services. Check the requirements of your local authority such as barangay clearance, health certificate or travel authority for any travel outside of your residence, including to the airport. For further information on rules and restrictions relating to quarantine classifications, visit the Department for Health website.
Travel to the airport
From 28 November, some airports including Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) need passengers to download the ‘Traze Contact Tracing’ app prior to entry. You can find further information on the NAIA facebook page.
If you plan to take a commercial flight but are experiencing difficulty travelling to the airport due to community quarantine restrictions, the British Embassy can provide a letter to facilitate your passage through checkpoints. You can submit your request to our Consular team via the web contact form. You can also seek assistance from your local Department of Tourism office, which may be able to offer advice on transport options or hotels.
The Philippine government has confirmed that foreign nationals will be able to leave the Philippines at any time during the period of enhanced quarantine. See Entry requirements.
There is disruption to travel routes both domestically and across the region. Check with your travel provider for updates.
