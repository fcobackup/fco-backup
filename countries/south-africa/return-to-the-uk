South African airspace is closed to commercial airlines as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). International commercial passenger flights are unlikely to resume for some time.
Land borders to neighbouring countries are closed except for trade.
Future options
Some other countries are still organising a limited number of repatriation flights, which British nationals may use to get connecting flights to the UK. All repatriation flights are subject to approval from the South African authorities. It is not uncommon for such approval to be granted after flights have already been advertised. You should therefore check with all airlines offering flights whether their published schedules are confirmed or subject to change before booking tickets and travelling.
The British High Commission is not responsible for the organisation or approval of the flights listed below. We will continue to share details on our social media channels @UkinSouthAfrica for flights where British nationals are eligible to travel and there are onward connections to the UK. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter.
Emirates are offering flights on 23, 25, 28 and 30 June, KLM are offering flights on 26 and 27 June and 3 and 4 July, and Lufthansa are offering a flight on 27 June, to European destinations with onward connections to the UK. If you wish to travel on one of these flights you should book through Emirates, KLM or through Lufthansa directly.
South African airspace is closed to commercial airlines, although some repatriation flights are happening.
If you have a flight ticket to go to the UK, the South African authorities have said you will need a letter from the British High Commission to enable you to travel to the assembly point for your flight. If you need such a letter, please email your name, passport number and flight ticket details to SouthAfricaBritishNationalReturns@fco.gov.uk.
You will also need the permission of the South African authorities if you want to return to the UK by private plane or boat. You should make your request via the British High Commission. Email details of your planned journey and your passenger details to SouthAfricaBritishNationalReturns@fco.gov.uk at least 10 working days prior to your date of travel.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option.
Whilst still in South Africa, you should continue to follow any regulations set out by the South African government during the lockdown.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
