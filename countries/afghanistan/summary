Since 19 March non-core British Embassy staff in Kabul, have been withdrawn from Post. Core staff remain to continue operational work.
Consular support is not available in parts of Afghanistan where the FCDO advise against all travel and severely limited where the FCDO advise against all but essential travel. The level of consular assistance the British Embassy can provide to travellers in Afghanistan is extremely limited. There are limits to the assistance the FCDO can provide in a crisis, depending on the security and transport situation. You should not assume that the FCDO will be able to provide assistance to leave the country.
The British Embassy is not able to accept registrations from British nationals travelling in Afghanistan or monitor their safety when they are in country. Staff from the British Embassy may be unable to travel to certain parts of the country due to the security situation; this may severely limit the consular assistance that can be offered. Travel by road throughout the country, but particularly outside the capital Kabul, is extremely dangerous. Seek professional security advice for all travel and consider using armoured vehicles.
Hotels and guesthouses used by foreign nationals and the government of Afghanistan are subject to regular threats. The British Embassy doesn’t allow official visitors to stay in hotels overnight and has placed restaurants and other venues off limits to staff. Make sure your accommodation is secure and review your security measures regularly.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Afghanistan. Specific methods of attack are evolving and increasing in sophistication. You should note an overall increased threat to Western interests in Kabul. Follow the instructions of local authorities. There is a high threat of kidnapping throughout the country. See Terrorism
Afghanistan is in a major earthquake zone and remains at risk from powerful earthquakes, aftershocks, landslides and flooding. The British Embassy can provide limited consular assistance in Afghanistan, particularly outside the capital Kabul. See Natural disasters
You can contact the emergency services by calling 119 (police and ambulance) and 112 (fire). They are unlikely to speak English.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
