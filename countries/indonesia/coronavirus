Domestic restrictions
On 31 March the Indonesian government announced new regulations to enforce large scale social distancing which includes limiting the movement of people and goods, and the restricting of religious practices and activities in public areas.
Large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) in Jakarta have been extended until 22 May with possible further extensions if necessary. Though essential services will still be available, public activities (including schools, offices, religious activities, social and cultural gatherings and public transportation) will be limited. The government are also restricting public gatherings and crowds to limit the possibility of COVID-19 transmission. Criminal sanctions may apply for violations of the restrictions. We expect other regions to implement similar restrictions in the near future.
If you are visiting or living in Indonesia, you should comply with all local regulations and be aware that limitations may change at short notice.
Entry and borders
Indonesia announced restrictions that apply from 2 April onwards.
All foreign nationals are barred from entering and transiting through Indonesia. There are 6 exceptions to the ban:
foreign nationals with limited (KITAS) and permanent stay (KITAP) permits.
foreign nationals with diplomatic visa and working visa
holders of diplomatic stay permits and business stay permits
those working on medical and food assistance
transportation (air, sea, or land) crew
foreign nationals working on national strategic projects
Entry requirements if you meet the above criteria are:
you must be in possession of a health certificate stating that you are COVID-19 free
you must not have not been in an area or country where there is COVID-19 for the last 14 days
you must provide a personal statement stating readiness to be quarantined for up to 14 days if required

Full details of the travel restrictions for foreign visitors are available in English on Twitter via DitJen Imigrasi (@ditjen_imigrasi). For additional information, see the announcement on the Indonesian Embassy website.
Visas
The visa exemption scheme is currently suspended for all visitors to which it previously applied, including visitors from the UK.
All those who wish to visit Indonesia must obtain a visa from the relevant Indonesian Mission in accordance with the purpose of their visit. Upon application, you must provide a health certificate issued by the relevant health authorities from your respective country.
The Indonesian Immigration authority emergency regulation on COVID-19 means that visa overstay fines will not apply to foreign nationals who entered Indonesia after 5 February.
Health screening and self-isolation
All visitors will also be required to present their health certificate at check-in ahead of any scheduled travel. Failure to present a health certificate may result in you being denied entry or transit in Indonesia. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
On arrival at Indonesian airports, all visitors must also complete and submit a Health Alert certificate to the Health Quarantine Office.
The Government of Indonesia requires that travellers from countries in which the World Health Organisation (WHO) has evidence of local transmission of COVID-19 should self-isolate for 14 days on arrival in Indonesia.
More information is available regarding coronavirus in Indonesia via the Ministry of Health.
Healthcare
A British national died of COVID-19 on 11 March 2020 in Bali. The standard of local medical care in Indonesia can be poor and some medical tests cannot be done reliably. As the Government of Indonesia announces rising numbers of COVID-19 cases, there is an increasing risk that the healthcare system will come under significant further strain. Access to routine and emergency healthcare may be limited.
Further information
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Indonesian Embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
