Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Niger.

This section has safety advice for regions of Niger. It only covers regions where FCDO has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Niamey
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to Niamey. We recommend that British Nationals who decide to travel remain within the city limits of Niamey.
Heightened security measures have been put in place in Niamey, including random stop and searches by local authorities. This is in response to the JNIM attack in Mali’s capital city, Bamako, in September 2024.
Outside of Niamey
FCDO advises against all travel to Niger, except the capital city of Niamey, for security reasons.
FCDO is unable to provide current and accurate information on the specific threat and risks in the regions outside Niamey.
Escort requirement
Outside of Niamey you must be escorted by Nigerien security and military forces. We recommend that British Nationals who decide to travel to Niger remain within the city limits of Niamey.
There is a lack of infrastructure in rural and desert areas increasing the safety risks. See road travel.
Border areas and Northern Niger
Terrorists operate in the areas bordering Mali, Libya, Burkina Faso, Nigeria and throughout northern Niger. Avoid travel to Niger’s border regions, particularly the Tillaberi and Diffa regions.  See Terrorism.
