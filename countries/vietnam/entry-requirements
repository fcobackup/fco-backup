This page has information on travelling to Vietnam.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Vietnam set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Vietnam’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy
If you plan to pass through another country to travel to Vietnam or return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Covid-19 Entry Requirements
Vietnam has lifted entry requirements connected to Covid-19. You do not require proof of Covid-19 vaccination or testing to enter Vietnam.
This may change in response to new variants, therefore you should monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you show symptoms of COVID-19 on arrival (fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, loss of taste, loss of smell, headache, diarrhoea, breathing difficulty, etc.) you must notify the health agency at the border gates.
Airlines and transit points may stipulate additional requirements to these so you should consult with your travel company/airline as to what is required, before travelling.
If you’re transiting through Vietnam
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
If you are transiting from an international flight to a domestic flight at Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City airports, you will be required to pass through immigration and enter Vietnam, even if your final destination is outside of Vietnam.
Check with your airline before departing.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Vietnam, your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive.
A number of British nationals have been refused entry and exit due to their passport being damaged. Make sure your passport is in good condition before arriving in Vietnam. Being refused entry can result in significant cost and a long stay at the airport.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
If you want to stay in Vietnam, you should only do so legally and with the right visa and permission to stay.
British Nationals can enter Vietnam for up to 15 days for tourism, transit and business (but not paid or voluntary work) without needing to apply for a visa. This will be extended to 45 days from 15 August.
If you wish to remain in Vietnam as a tourist for longer than 15 days (45 days from 15 August) there are two visa options:
Book a tour with a travel agent in Vietnam requesting that the agent applies for a visa pre-approval letter for your travel to Vietnam. On receipt of the pre-approval letter by the Vietnamese Embassy your agent will inform you when to collect your visa from the Embassy;
Apply for an e-visa online through the online portal. E-visas are issued for stays of up to 30 days, single entry only. E-visas will be increased to 90 day, multiple entry visas from 15 August. Use of the e-visa is limited to certain entry/exit points which you must select at the time of application. You cannot make any amendments once your application is completed.
If you apply for the 30 day e-visa while in Vietnam and are successful, you must leave the country before your initial 15 day stay expires to validate the 30 day e-visa.
If you are travelling to Vietnam for business for longer than 15 days, or are an expert and/ or a high-skilled worker you will need to contact your business partner/ employer/ sponsor in Vietnam to work with relevant authorities of Vietnam to arrange the issuance of your visa.
Those needing to renew their non-tourist visas can do so by completing the support request format or by telephoning the following number: 0283 920 0365 (ideally with the help of a Vietnamese speaker).
Vietnamese visit visas are issued for a limited duration, printed on the visa, and on the basis that visitors must leave on or before the date of expiry. Those who come to Vietnam to work are required to apply for a work visa/ permit. You should check the visa validity and conditions carefully. Overstaying your Vietnamese visit visa or working illegally is a serious matter and you may be delayed from travel until a fine is paid, deported and may be prevented from visiting Vietnam in the future.
The British Embassy and British Consulate General will not be able to assist with individual visit visa extensions should you wish to stay in Vietnam, nor sponsor individual applications or sign NA5 forms (which has the same effect) as this involves legal and financial obligations. For those with a valid work visa or resident cards, you can extend these at immigration offices with the assistance and support of your family or employer.
