Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Finland, see information on driving abroad and check the rules of the road in the RACâ€™s Finland guide. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.
You need a UK driving licence to drive in Finland. Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, minimum age and holding an international driving permit.
Check if you need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. 
Drink-driving laws
Drink-driving is a serious offence in Finland, and you could get a prison sentence if found guilty. The drink-drive limit in Finland is significantly lower than the limit in England.
Arctic travel
Parts of Finland are in the Arctic Circle, including some very remote areas of land. Emergency medical assistance and search and rescue are limited in these areas. See Arctic travel safety advice.
