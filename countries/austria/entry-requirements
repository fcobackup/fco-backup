The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Anyone entering Austria from the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Liechtenstein, Slovakia, Slovenia or Switzerland, or anyone who has, in the last 14 days, been in an area for which the Austrian Foreign Ministry has travel warnings in place due to COVID-19 (including the UK), must present a medical certificate with micro-biological test results in English, French, German or Italian which is no more than 4 days old.
Without this document, entry will be refused for anyone without a valid Austrian residence permit, with some exceptions (in German). Anyone with a valid Austrian residence permit can enter Austria, but without a valid medical certificate will be required to self-isolate for 14 days.
Transit during coronavirus
UK nationals transiting through Austria without a stopover do not require a health medical certificate, if they can prove they are transiting. Neighbouring countries are restricting movement across borders and conducting health checks.
There are no direct rail connections from Austria to the Czech Republic, Italy, Slovakia, Slovenia or Switzerland. You should refer to travel advice for the country you are travelling from/to for information.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Austria. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Austria guide and contact the Austrian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Travelling with children
If you are a single parent, or travelling with a child who is not your own, you will need documentary evidence of parental responsibility and a letter of consent. For further information on exactly what will be required at immigration contact the Austrian Embassy in London.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Austria.
