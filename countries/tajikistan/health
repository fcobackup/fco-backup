your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.

Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Healthcare in Tajikistan
Tajikistan has poor medical facilities and a shortage of basic medical supplies. Medical facilities outside Dushanbe are quite basic and in some locations almost non-existent.
Tajikistan has a limited mountain rescue capability. This will be further limited in cases where individuals need rescue in high altitude or where weather conditions do not allow. Weather conditions can change rapidly at short notice, particularly in mountainous and high altitude locations.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Tajikistan where some staff will speak English.
