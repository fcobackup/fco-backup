Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Sudan. The Sudanese authorities have suspended all international commercial passenger flights to and from Sudan.
The Sudanese authorities have closed all land borders (except for transfer of humanitarian aid).
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Sudan. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Sudanese authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you are a British national in Sudan and wish to register your intention to return to the UK, please email the details listed below to our dedicated mailbox at stayincontactsudan@fco.gov.uk. Register your details with us even if you have previously been in contact so that we have the information listed below:
your full name as shown on your passport
passport number
date of birth
place of residence in UK
where exactly you are currently staying in Sudan
email address and telephone number (please ensure that you are able to receive phone calls from unidentified numbers, including internationally, in case we need to reach you)
any specific medical needs/vulnerabilities
evidence of your return journey to the UK, eg an itinerary or confirmed flight booking that you were unable to use or is imminent
copy of the details page of your passport
You should also provide this information for any family members with you in Sudan that are also seeking to return to the UK.
If you cannot leave Sudan
If you cannot leave Sudan at this time, see advice on staying in Sudan during coronavirus.

This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information see the guidance on financial assistance while you are abroad.
