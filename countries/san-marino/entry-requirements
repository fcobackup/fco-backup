This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in San Marino set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
You will need to travel through Italy in order to enter San Marino.
Entry into San Marino from an Italian red or orange zone is only permitted in cases of necessity, health or work. There are no restrictions on entering San Marino from a designated white or yellow zone.
If your journey started outside of Italy, in the 14 days prior to your arrival in San Marino, you must show evidence of a vaccination certificate or a negative PCR or antigenic test, taken within 48 hours of your arrival in San Marino. Children under the age of 10 do not need to show evidence of a test. Your test certificate must be emailed in advance to laboratorio.analisi@iss.sm.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
San Marino will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You don’t need a visa to visit San Marino. If you’re staying in San Marino for less than 30 days in an official residency (ie hotel or bed and breakfast) you don’t need a ‘permesso di soggiorno turistico’. However, if you’re staying privately, you’ll need to report your stay to the Ufficio Stranieri (Foreigners’ Office) of the local Gendarmerie within 24 hours of arrival. If you’re staying for work you must apply for a ‘permesso per motivi di lavoro’ (a work permit), which is issued for some categories of workers only.
More information about permits is available on the San Marino website.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry and exit from San Marino.
