The Timorese authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Detection and treatment of the disease in Timor-Leste will be difficult, given the limited healthcare available. There is a risk that the healthcare system will come under significant strain as coronavirus (COVID-19) spreads. Medical evacuation may not be available or be very expensive.
Travel restrictions
On 12 March, the Timorese authorities introduced restrictions for all foreign nationals who have visited Iran, Italy and South Korea within the last 4 weeks. If you have entered or transited any of these countries, you will not be permitted to enter Timor-Leste. If you arrive in Timor-Leste after entering or transiting these countries and refuse to return to your previous location you may be subject to quarantine for a minimum for 14 days.
On 5 March the government introduced a temporary ban on all foreign nationals entering Timor-Leste that have entered or transited China within the previous four weeks. If you wish to enter Timor-Leste, you must be able to present a medical report to immigration officials from an internationally recognised institution declaring that you do not have coronavirus. This restriction is subject to review on a fortnightly basis.
Please see the Government of Timor-Leste website for more information.
