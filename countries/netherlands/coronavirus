Travel in the Netherlands
The latest information on Dutch domestic coronavirus measures can be found on the Dutch government website (in English).
Non-medical face masks must be worn on public transport if you are aged 13 and over. If you do not wear a face mask on public transport you can be fined €95. In stations, on platforms and at bus and tram stops face masks are not required, but you must stay 1.5 metres away from others. Buses, trains, trams and metros can now operate at full capacity. However, you should avoid using public transport during peak hours.
For other shared forms of transport, such as taxis, passenger vans and coaches, reservations should be made in advance and you must wear a non-medical face mask.
If you’re travelling in a car or other private vehicle, you are advised to wear non-medical face masks if there are two or more people in the vehicle who belong to different households.
On other forms of transport, you must stay 1.5 metres apart.
Schiphol, Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports
All passengers and staff aged 13+ are urged to wear face masks in all areas of these airports. The terminals are only open for passengers and staff. You must not be accompanied into the airport, unless absolutely necessary for a traveller with reduced mobility.
Ferries
DFDS
All travellers must wear face coverings at check-in, whilst boarding, and during disembarkation. This applies for both foot- and car passengers, as well as freight drivers. On the Amsterdam - Newcastle route, passengers must wear face coverings whilst moving around the ship. Face coverings do not need to be worn when travellers are in their cabins, seated in a socially distanced manner or whilst social distancing on outside decks.
P&O
All travellers must wear a face mask during their journey.
Eurostar
All passengers aged 13+ must wear a face mask at Eurostar stations and on board trains. If you don’t have a mask you may be refused travel on Eurostar services.
Public Spaces and Services
As of 4 November, certain additional measures have been put in place in response to a recent increase in COVID-19 cases. These measures include limiting the size of groups meeting from different households and the closure of museums, cinemas and other attractions. Full details of these and other measures can be found on the Dutch government website (in English).
You are required to wear a mask in all indoor public spaces. This does not include children under the age of 13.
The Dutch government is advising people to avoid travelling abroad unless your journey is essential.
You should check the latest local information before travelling, as individual regions might have imposed extra measures.
You must stay 1.5 metres away from other people. This applies to everyone over the age of 18: in the street, in shops and other buildings. It does not apply to family members or other people that you live with and it does not apply if you are providing assistance to someone, for example pushing a wheelchair. If you notice that it is becoming difficult to keep a distance of 1.5 metres, you should leave. Avoid busy places in general, as if a gathering poses a safety or public health risk, enforcement officers can take action.
