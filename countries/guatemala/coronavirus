Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities (only available in Spanish).
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Guatemala
Restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus are in place. If you are in Guatemala you should:
observe social distancing of at least 1.5 metres;
wear a mask. This is mandatory for everyone in public places, including on the street, as well as on any kind of transport. Children under 2 years of age and those with a medical condition certified by a health professional are exempt from this requirement;
be aware that people who have recovered from COVID-19 must wear their masks for 14 days after recovery. Those under quarantine must also wear masks inside their homes;
wash and sanitise your hands frequently
Sale of alcoholic and fermented beverages are prohibited from 1am to 6am.
If you do not comply with these measures you could be fined or face criminal charges. Fines range from £700 to £15,000.
Every town has been assigned a colour from red to green, which corresponds to the number of positive COVID-19 cases reported. For information about the specific restrictions in your location, refer to the Guatemalan government’s website.
You should familiarise yourself with the threat level in your area and keep up to date with any changes.
Public transport is operating, however, there are a number of restrictions on capacity and access can still be very limited. If you wish to travel to or from the airport you should hire a private taxi or driver.
When travelling in the country, follow the advice of the local authorities (PROATUR) and monitor local media. See Local travel.

Healthcare in Guatemala
Many of the hospitals in Guatemala are full given the COVID-19 situation in the country. If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms you should seek medical advice and check the official page where all important information about COVID-19 as well as all advice from the Guatemalan authorities can be found. Please visit the Guatemalan Ministry of Health’s website for further information and advice.
British-issued prescriptions cannot be used locally. To find a pharmacy (“farmacia”) look for one of the big national chains such as Meykos, Cruz Verde or Carolina y H, among others; searching online should help you to identify the nearest one.
