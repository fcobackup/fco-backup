This page has information on travelling to Brazil.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Brazil set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Brazil’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
All passengers arriving in Brazil do not need to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination, a negative COVID-19 test, or a certificate of recovery from COVID-19. For more information see the Consulate General of Brazil in London – Visiting Brazil website.
You can travel to Brazil without a visa as a tourist for up to 90 days. If you wish to extend your tourist visa, you should contact the Policia Federal.
See Visas and Passport validity section for more information.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Brazil.
Visas
British nationals can normally enter Brazil without a visa as a tourist. For further information about visas, see the website of the Brazilian Consulate in London.
Ensure you comply with Brazilian immigration laws on arrival in the country. You must satisfy the Federal Police (the Brazilian immigration authority) of the purpose of your visit. You will need to demonstrate that you have enough money for the duration of your stay, provide de-tails of your accommodation and evidence of return or onward travel. Make sure your passport is stamped. If it is not, you may be fined on departure.
If you wish to extend your stay in Brazil, you should apply to the Federal Police for an extension. If you overstay, you are likely to be given notice to leave the country at your own expense and you may be fined or deported.
Dual nationality
The Brazilian immigration authorities often require dual British/Brazilian nationals visiting Brazil to travel on Brazilian (rather than British) passports.
Travelling with children
There are additional requirements for British-Brazilian dual nationals under 18 entering or transiting through Brazil without their parents or legal guardian, or travelling with one parent only. These requirements don’t usually apply to foreign nationals, but as a precaution and to avoid any possible delays, British nationals under 18 entering or transiting through Brazil without their parents or legal guardian, or travelling with one parent only, are advised to bring a letter of authorisation to travel from any parent(s) not travelling. This applies particularly to children with a Brazilian parent, even if the child only holds a British passport. Contact the Brazilian Consulate in London for more information and advice.
