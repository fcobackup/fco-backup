If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
What to do if you test positive while in Greece
If you test positive for COVID-19 while in Greece you must self-isolate for 5 days from the date of the positive test result. You may leave self-isolation after 5 days if you have not had a fever in the past 24 hours, otherwise you should continue to self-isolate.
There is an exception for tourists leaving Greece to return home. You may leave self-isolation before the end of the 5 day isolation period in order to travel back to your country of origin, provided you wear a high protection mask and do not have a fever.
If you test positive for COVID-19 you should inform your accommodation provider. If you have serious symptoms you may be transferred to a medical centre dedicated to COVID-19 treatment. The UK government will not cover quarantine costs for British nationals.
The above guidance may not apply in the case of variants of special interest. These cases will be assessed by the EMEA (Greek health authority) and appropriate instructions will be given.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
EHIC or GHIC cards cannot be used to cover any additional expenses you incur while self-isolating. Make sure you have access to funds to cover the costs or take out insurance, checking the policy has adequate cover.
If you have or are entitled to an EHIC or GHIC and you need medical treatment while self-isolating, the UK government will fund treatment as usual through the EHIC/GHIC scheme.
Find out more from the NHS website about EHIC and GHIC healthcare cover abroad.
Wearing a mask
It is mandatory to wear a mask on public transport and in hospitals and care facilities for the elderly.
It is also mandatory to wear a mask in pharmacies, taxis, and indoor spaces on boats.
In all other spaces, there is no legal requirement to wear a mask.
Public spaces and services
All restrictions remain under regular review. In Regional Units (περιφερειακές ενότητες) where the spread of COVID-19 is particularly high and hospital capacity is limited, restrictions may be tighter or re-imposed with limited notice. Check the latest local guidance and follow the advice of local authorities.
Only the most relevant measures to travellers are included below. You should keep up-to-date by checking this page regularly, and following local announcements.

Travel in Greece
Travel within Greece between Regional Units is permitted subject to adherence to public health measures as outlined above. You must wear a mask at all times on all public transport.
If you are travelling by internal (domestic) flights, specific measures relating to check-in, baggage allowances and other details may be in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus. You should check with your operator directly for further detail.
Accommodation
All hotels are permitted to open, and other types of accommodation, including e.g. Airbnb, private rentals and hostels, are also available. However, you should note that many operators are likely to reduce their offer and close some accommodation during the winter months, particularly in light of measures put in place by the Greek authorities to fight the spread of COVID-19. You should check directly with your accommodation provider in case of related concerns.
Healthcare in Greece
If you think you have symptoms, including a fever or respiratory difficulties such as shortness of breath or a cough, you should avoid visiting local health facilities, but contact a doctor remotely to see whether a test is recommended. There is likely to be a cost associated with this, for call out, examination and testing, which you will have to pay.
If you are staying in a hotel or resort, your accommodation provider will have a list of private doctors that they will call to assess your symptoms and conduct a COVID-19 test.
If you have arranged your own accommodation you can find details of English speaking, private doctors on our list of healthcare providers.
For more information, consult the Greek National Public Health Organisation (NPHO) online or via telephone (dial 1135, or 210 521 2054, from within Greece).
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Greece
Wherever possible, British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Greece announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Greek national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and uses the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) and Moderna vaccines. British nationals resident in Greece are eligible for vaccination. You can get more information on the Greek National Vaccination Programme. You can register online through the website or get help registering at any pharmacy in Greece. The Greek authorities are aware of issues registering for those who don’t hold AMKA numbers, and are currently working to implement a solution. You should continue to check the Greek National Vaccination Programme (available in Greek and in English) for the latest information, or email support.gov@gsis.gr
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Greece, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Greece, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It can help facilitate your travel within the EU and to the UK and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
