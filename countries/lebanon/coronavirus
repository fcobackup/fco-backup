International travel
Commercial flights are operating to and from Lebanon. Check with your travel company for the latest information.
From Monday 11 January 2021, all travellers to Lebanon will be required to take a PCR test at Beirut International Airport upon arrival (which is provided at the airline’s expense) and then to quarantine for one week. You must quarantine at a Government of Lebanon approved hotel for 48 hours until you receive the results of your airport test. Buses will transport passengers from the airport to hotels. You must have a prepaid booking at one of these hotels in order to board your flight to Lebanon. See further details here.
When you receive your airport test result, if it is negative, you may move to your accommodation. You must continue to quarantine at your accommodation before taking another PCR test (that you must arrange yourself) a week after your arrival. If both tests are negative, you may leave quarantine.
If you are arriving from Baghdad, Istanbul, Adana, Cairo or Addis Ababa, you must quarantine at a Government of Lebanon approved hotel for the full 7 days.

Travel in Lebanon
Lebanon has declared a state of emergency from 14 – 25 January 2021 due to the rise in number of COVID-19 cases. A total curfew will be in place from 5am on 14 January until 5am on 25 January. Movement is completely prohibited – you must not leave your accomodation. All hospitality businesses and public institutions will close. There are some exemptions for essential work. Food delivery services will be allowed to operate between 5am and 5pm.
Beirut International airport will remain open, but land and sea borders will close, apart from for those transiting Beirut airport who hold tickets for flights on that day. All passengers are required to have their tickets with them when transferring to and from the airport. Some exemptions to COVID-19 restrictions are applied to aid workers. For further clarification, aid workers should contact the United Nations for advice.
When travelling to and from the airport, private cars should have no more than four people in them (including the driver). Wearing masks for all passengers is obligatory. Given the total curfew, you are advised to book taxis to and from the airport ahead of time.
Fabric masks covering the mouth and nose must be worn when outside the home and in vehicles (unless travelling alone).
Lebanese authorities may issue fines, impose road blocks, or imprison those violating these measures for up to three years. You should comply with all measures introduced by the Lebanese authorities and obey the instructions of the security forces. These measures may be changed at short notice.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Accommodation
Hotels and private rentals are available. You should check that accommodation is open and receiving guests before booking, and request information on the measures being taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
