At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19). The virus originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in China, but cases have been confirmed in other parts of China and in other countries, including the Philippines.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises against all but essential travel to the whole of the Philippines due to impacts on British Nationals of government imposed measures being taken to reduce the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
On 17 March, the Philippine Authorities announced that, as part of the enhanced community quarantine measures, any outbound passengers intending to depart the Philippines from any international airport on Luzon shall be allowed to depart until 00:01 local time on 20th March (16:01 UK time 19th March). After this point, outward flights will be significantly restricted until 13 April.
As of 16 March ‘Enhanced community quarantine’ has been imposed across Luzon Island. This will affect British Nationals’ ability to travel and access essential services, following the shutdown of all public transportation. This is an evolving situation, and you are advised to follow the announcements of local authorities across Luzon.British Nationals resident in the Philippines should consider the extent to which the restrictions on travel will impact them.
Our advice does not suggest that people should leave the Philippines if they consider the restrictions on movement will not impact them severely enough to make them want to leave.
The Philippine government has declared a public health emergency following the emergence of local transmission of COVID-19. On 12 March, the Philippine government announced Code Red Sublevel 2 in response to COVID-19. This imposes restrictions including social distancing requirements across Metro Manila. From 15th March travel to and from Metro Manila will be restricted for a period of 30 days. The government also announced a travel ban for all foreign nationals coming from countries reporting local transmissions of COVID-19. This includes the UK. Exemptions to this ban include the spouse and children of Philippine passport holders, permanent residents and holders of diplomatic passports. On 14 March it was proposed that a curfew be put in place for Metro Manila that should run from 8pm to 5am. The details of the curfew, whether it will be put in place, and which areas it will effect are not yet clear. The situation remains uncertain and amendments to the restrictions continue to be announced. You should take local advice on what restrictions are in place wherever you are in the Philippines.
There is disruption to travel routes both domestically and across the region. Check with your travel provider for updates.
The Philippine Department for Health and the Bureau of Immigration are issuing information about the situation on their websites. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you should contact your airline or nearest Philippine Embassy.
Further advice on coronavirus (COVID-19) is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
Health risks
UK health authorities have classified the Philippines as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
Mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis (JE) and chikungunya virus occur all year round.
There’s a heightened risk of dengue fever during the rainy season (June to October). The Philippines Department of Health declared a national dengue epidemic on 6 August 2019. You should take appropriate precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.
Medical treatment
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
The availability of medical care varies across the Philippines, and may not meet the standards of care in the UK. Although adequate in major cities, medical care is limited in more remote areas. Even some of the more popular tourist destinations have limited and basic medical provisions. Many places do not have hospitals nearby or easy access to emergency medical care, which may result in a delay when seeking urgent medical attention in an emergency.
Private hospital treatment and medical transport can be too expensive for many people, eg the daily cost in intensive care units can be more than £1,000. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, medical transport and repatriation.
