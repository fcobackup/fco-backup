Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Laos.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Laos set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, send a message to the Lao Embassy London Facebook page.
Passport validity requirements
Your passport should have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you enter Laos.
Airlines only allow boarding of flights to and from Laos if you have 2 blank pages in your passport.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document, or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
Applying for a visa
Visa on arrival is available at Vientiane’s Wattay International Airport, Luang Prabang’s and Paske airports but not at all land borders or Lao Immigration checkpoints.
You can apply online for an e-Visa - you must submit your application at least 3 days in advance of your entry to Laos.
Visa extensions
Tourist visas will only be extended twice in Laos. Be aware if you do not renew your visa within 90 days, you will face a fine in Lao Kip equivalent to 2,000 US Dollars, deportation to your home country and a ban on returning to Laos.
To stay longer (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Lao immigration department’s entry requirements .
Vaccination requirements
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the vaccinations and certificates you need in TravelHealthPro’s Laos guide .
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of country. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
