Medication
Many medicines may be fake or hard to find in Mauritania. Carry enough of your prescription medication for your stay. The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in Mauritania
Medical facilities are extremely limited in Mauritania, particularly outside Nouakchott and Nouadhibou, where lack of communications makes dealing with an emergency very difficult.
Clinics in Nouakchott and Nouadhibou charge for medical care (sometimes in euros or US dollars) and may not accept foreign insurance cards. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
FCDO has a list of medical providers in Mauritania where some staff will speak English. 
There is also guidance on healthcare if you’re living in Mauritania.
