Hurricane Beryl
A major hurricane struck Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on 1 July 2024, significantly impacting services and causing widespread damage. If you plan to visit Union Island, Mayreau, or Canouan, confirm arrangements with your travel agent or accommodation provider. Services are still affected on these islands, and there are ongoing relief and reconstruction efforts. Services have returned to normal on St. Vincent and Bequia.
You should follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders. See Extreme weather and natural disasters
