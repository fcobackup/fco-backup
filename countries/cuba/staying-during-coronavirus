This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Cuba as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Cuba to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). On 11 June, the Government set out recovery phases that will lift some of the measures in place. However, no time frame has yet been published so the measures described here are still in place. The timing of each recovery phase is likely to differ between Provinces. Havana is expected to be the last place where measures will be relaxed.

Measures for tourists
Tourists staying in hotels or casas particulares will be confined to those hotels. People should not leave their accommodation unless there are essential reasons, e.g. to get money, go to the clinic, go to the airport (only when flights resume). All excursions are suspended. A medic will visit the hotel twice per day. As the number of guests in hotels reduces, hotels will close and the guests will be moved into one hotel.
Tourists can only stay in authorised casas particulars (private houses), and must stay in the house or may be moved to government hotels. The government will cover the transport. The cost of the hotel may not be the same as the private house.
All discos, nightclubs, gymnasiums, etc (government or private owned for public access, and in hotels) are closed.
Restaurants and bars have restricted services; only delivery or take away services will be allowed unless exceptions are made.
Camp sites are be closed.
Tourists can only move around for essential trips and in officially authorised and licensed transport, e.g. yellow taxis to go to a clinic. Tourists can no longer rent cars.
Local measures
Transport between provinces has been suspended. Urban transport services have been limited from 11 April to essential services and fewer people will be allowed to travel in a bus or car. Private taxi services will be suspended.
Wearing masks in public places is compulsory, including in vehicles.
People in queues must maintain a minimum of distance of one metre between them.
There will be an increased police presence in the streets and shops, to monitor that people are following the measures.
If you have dual British and Cuban nationality, you are subject to Cuban measures and should check your immigration status to clarify if you can leave Cuba while current travel restrictions are in place (and when flights resume). If you need permission to leave, you should get this from the immigration office in Havana; permission cannot be given at the airport.
Visas
During the period of special Cuban government measures, visa extension requirements have been suspended. If you are still in Cuba and your visa has expired or will expire while flights are suspended, you can ask the hotel management to help you to enquire with the local immigration office (there is one in each municipality).

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Cuba, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
