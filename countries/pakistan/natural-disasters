The monsoon season in Pakistan is from late June to early October. Heavy rains can cause severe flooding, particularly in Sindh and Punjab Provinces.
Check local forecasts and news reports and be aware of the risk of landslides and road blockages, particularly in hilly and mountainous regions. Take extreme care crossing swollen rivers.
Earth tremors are common and mountainous areas regularly experience floods and landslides. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
