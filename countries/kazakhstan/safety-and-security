Protests have taken place since 2 January 2022 in Atyrau and the wider Mangystau region, spreading from 3 January 2022 to other cities across Kazakhstan including Aktobe, Karaganda, Almaty, Nur-Sultan, Shymkent, and Kyzylorda. Some cities, including Almaty and Atyrau, have seen violent clashes between protestors and police with deaths, injuries and arrests reported. As a result, the Kazakh Government has imposed a nationwide State of Emergency. An 11pm to 7am curfew is in effect in most cities, but this has been extended to 7pm-7am in some cities in the south of the country. The internet has been blocked in large parts of the country, and you may find it difficult to use credit cards and withdraw cash. Other measures introduced include:
Restrictions on the movement of residents within these cities/regions;
Increased presence of law enforcement and security personnel on the streets;
Increased ID checks and vehicle searches by police;
A ban on demonstrations and other mass gatherings;
Restrictions on the sale of some medicines and alcohol;
If you’re in a city in Kazakhstan which has seen protests you should avoid mass gatherings, limit your movements and travel, including working from home where possible, and follow government instructions.
If you are planning to travel to the region, check the status of your flight and consult with your hosts/hotels about whether flights from the airport and transport into the city are operating.
Crime
Most visits are trouble-free. However, mugging and theft occur in cities and rural areas. Foreigners can be targeted.
There have been a number of violent attacks and muggings on the expatriate community in Atyrau and Aktau in western Kazakhstan, and in Nur-Sultan and Almaty. Attacks have largely taken place at night, in and around local nightclubs and bars or when arriving at home late at night, as the majority of apartment buildings have dark stairwells and no lifts. Avoid walking alone and where possible pre-arrange transport. Keep valuables in a safe place and out of public view. Avoid travelling in unofficial taxis, particularly at night and alone, or if there is another passenger already in the car.
Robberies have occurred on trains, so always lock railway compartments on overnight trains.
Passenger lists on aircraft are not always kept confidential. There have been instances of people being met from an aircraft by someone using their name and then being robbed.
Local travel
Closed areas
The following areas of Kazakhstan are closed to visitors unless prior permission has been received from the Foreign Ministry and the Interior Ministry, with the agreement of the Kazakh National Security Committee:
the Gvardeyskiy urban-type village in Almaty region (south eastern Kazakhstan) 
the town of Baykonur
the districts of Karmakchi and Kazalinsk in southern Kyzylorda region
Borders
Do not cross the border into or out of Kazakhstan illegally.
Some land borders remain closed to foreign nationals due to Coronavirus restrictions.
Road travel
If you wish to drive in Kazakhstan you should apply for a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP). 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in Kazakhstan. You can get IDPs over the counter from most UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus are a single Customs Union so if you’re planning to travel overland in your own vehicle make sure your customs declaration and temporary import licence are valid for the entire period of stay in all three countries. Your import licence can be extended for up to a year if necessary by contacting the customs authorities in any of the three countries.
Service stations are limited outside the main cities. Make sure you take all you need for your journey including water. Make sure your vehicle is properly maintained and in good condition for lengthy journeys.
Many roads are poorly maintained and road works or damaged roads are often not clearly signposted. Driving standards can be erratic. In some remote areas there are often stray animals on the roads. These are especially difficult to see in the dark. In winter, roads can become hazardous due to snow and ice.
Local traffic police only have the right to stop vehicles if an offence has been committed, but you should obey any request from the police to stop. The police officer should complete official papers relating to any alleged offence.
Many cars are not safely maintained and do not have rear seatbelts.
Take care when crossing roads as pedestrian crossings are rarely respected.
Air travel
On 4 January 2022, agitators stormed Almaty Airport. The airport is now back under the control of the security forces, but no commercial flights are arriving or departing at present. It is unclear when the airport will reopen. Commercial flights are operating to and from Nur-Sultan Airport; and Air Astana is now running direct flights to London. However, some flights continue to be cancelled. Check with your travel company for the latest information.
The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation has carried out an audit of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Kazakhstan.
On 27 December 2019, an internal flight operated by the carrier ‘Bek Air’ crashed in Almaty, killing a number of people. Kazakhstan’s civil aviation authority has suspended the company’s licence. A list of further incidents and accidents in Kazakhstan can be found on the website of the Aviation Safety network.
Local airlines do not always run to flight schedule. Check your actual departure or arrival time in advance. Keep hold of your baggage tags, as you will need to show them when you leave the airport.
Political situation
Public demonstrations are only permitted when authorised in advance. Unauthorised small-scale public protests do take place occasionally, in contravention of local law, putting participants at risk of arrest. You should avoid any demonstrations or political gatherings. If you become aware of any nearby violence you should leave the area immediately.
