Crime
Levels of crime across the Turks and Caicos Islands are relatively low. However, Providenciales, the first point of arrival into the Turks and Caicos Islands for some visitors and the territory’s economic hub, and Grand Turk, the nation’s capital, has seen higher level of gun related crime than other islands in the Turks and Caicos, mainly concentrated in known locations away from tourist areas. Whilst risks are lower in tourist areas you should take local advice and be aware of your surroundings at all times.
Most crime tends to be as a result of opportunistic burglary and theft, although an increase in more serious robberies against individuals has been reported. Victims of robberies and burglaries may suffer injuries if they resist. Safeguard your possessions and take normal precautions to ensure your personal safety, including when using ATM machines, especially at night. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash and valuables. Take particular care of your passport as this can’t be replaced locally. Use hotel or villa safety deposit facilities where possible. See the Turks and Caicos crime-stoppers website for more crime prevention tips.
Local travel
If you visit isolated spots or remote islands, or go diving/snorkelling, leave details of your trip and an expected time of return with a friend, relative, hotel receptionist or villa staff. Avoid isolated spots and unlit roads at night.
Standard taxi fares exist for most destinations on the principal islands. Charges may be applied per person. Clarify the fare with the driver before beginning a journey.
Road travel
You can drive using a British Driving Licence or an International Driving Permit for a period of one month. After this you should get a local licence from the Department of Road Safety.
Most hire cars and jeeps are imported from the US and so are left-hand drive even though driving is on the left (as in the UK). Remember to drive on the left. Observe speed limits (20mph in town, and 40mph elsewhere). Don’t drink and drive. Use seat belts on all journeys. Accidents, sometimes serious, are on the increase on the Leeward Highway (Providenciales), especially at night. Be aware of cyclists and cars driving at night without lights.
Emergency assistance
The Turks and Caicos Islands is a British Overseas Territory so does not have formal British consular representation. All emergency assistance needed by British nationals is delivered by the Turks and Caicos Islands government.
