Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

Crime
Crime levels are low although there is some petty crime. Pickpocketing can be a problem in the major cities when tourists are targeted for passports and cash.
Violent crime does occur; instances of gang related crime, including knife crime, shootings and explosions, have been reported in Malmö, Stockholm and Gothenburg.
Employment
You should check carefully whether any offers of employment for asphalting or seasonal work are genuine. Contact the British Embassy in Stockholm for further advice if necessary.
Winter travel
Sweden deals with its harsh weather very well, but delayed trains and flights are difficult to avoid during severe weather conditions. Snow and ice on the roads cause accidents daily. Consider starting your journey earlier to avoid rushing to your destination. Be prepared for harsh conditions particularly in the north during the winter.
Road travel
Licences and documents
You can drive in Sweden on your UK driving licence. Driving licence rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
If you’re living in Sweden, check the the Living in Guide for information on requirements for residents.
Driving regulations
From 1 December to 31 March and when weather conditions are wintry, all Swedish and foreign registered vehicles, both light and heavy, are required by law to have either studded tyres or un-studded friction tyres bearing the following mark, M+S, M-s, M.S, M&S, MS or Mud and Snow.
The road conditions are considered to be wintry when there is snow, ice, slush or frost on any part of the road. The Swedish police decides whether there are wintry conditions on a certain road.
In Sweden everyone travelling in a car is required to wear a seat belt. Children who are shorter than 135cm must use a special protective device – either a baby car seat, child car seat, booster seat or booster cushion. All long-distance buses are equipped with seat belts, which passengers are required to use by law. Bicycle helmets are mandatory for children under 15 (but not for adult cyclists). It’s illegal to use a mobile phone in your hand when driving.
See the European Commission, AA and RAC guides on driving in Sweden.
Road safety
In 2018 there were 324 road deaths in Sweden (source: Department for Transport). This equates to 3.2 road deaths per 100,000 of population. This compares to the UK average of 2.8 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2018.
