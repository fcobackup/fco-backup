This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Iceland set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Iceland for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Due to COVID-19 restrictions, non-essential travel by British citizens from the UK/other non EU/EEA country to Iceland is only permitted if you:
are resident in Iceland, or
can adequately demonstrate you have either been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or previously recovered from COVID-19 infection
From 26 July you will need to present a negative PCR or antigen (rapid) test that is no more than 72 hours old before departing to Iceland.
You can check whether you can enter Iceland here. All travellers must pre-register before arrival.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
You will be asked to provide proof of vaccination which must contain the specific COVID information Iceland requires.
Iceland will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. If you are travelling with a printed PDF proof of vaccination status, it must date from 1 November 2021 to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Certificates of previous infection must be a PCR test or antibody test and meet Iceland’s criteria.
Entry without a certificate of vaccination or previous infection
If you do not have an acceptable certificate of vaccination or of previous infection, and are not a resident of Iceland, there are only a very limited number of essential reasons for which you will be given permission to travel.
When flying into Iceland without a certificate of vaccination or previous infection you must follow these steps:
present a negative PCR taken within 72 hours of your time of departure to Iceland (or get a ISK 100,000 fine for residents or a refusal of entry for visitors)
take 2 COVID-19 tests, one on arrival and another 5 to 6 days later,
quarantine between tests, until you have the results
Entry with a certificate of vaccination or previous infection
Those visiting Iceland that have no family connections there must present a negative PCR or negative antigen rapid test taken within 72 hours of your time of departure to Iceland (or get a ISK 100,000 fine for residents or a refusal of entry for visitors). Self-tests are not accepted.
Those who live in Iceland or have family there do not need to present a negative COVID-19 test on arrival at the border but must take a COVID-19 test within 48 hours of arriving in Iceland. These tests will be free of charge and can be obtained at Keflavik airport or at the healthcare centres all over Iceland. There is no requirement to quarantine pending results of the test. Those failing to comply with this testing requirement within the time limit can be fined
Full guidance can be found in English on the Iceland website.
If you are a resident, then you are strongly advised to have a C-122 residence certificate with you at the airport to avoid issues at check-in.
Children born in or before 2004 need to undergo testing at the border, quarantine for 5 days and then be tested a second time, unless they have a certificate of full vaccination. Children born in 2005 or later are exempt from the rules at the border.
If you are travelling with a child, and need to be quarantined, so will the child. The child will be released from quarantine if your second test on day 5-6 is negative. Children travelling alone do not need to quarantine.
Travel from high risk countries
Iceland defines certain countries as high risk for travel. You will be prohibited from entering Iceland if you are travelling from, or have recently been in, these countries and do not have an acceptable certificate of vaccination or of previous infection.
If you are resident in Iceland, or have the permission of the Icelandic Authorities to travel from, or have in the previous 14 days stayed in, these areas you may need to stay in managed quarantine facilities if you do not have a suitable place to self-isolate in Iceland. These measures will significantly affect what you can and cannot do on arrival. If you have booked a trip to Iceland you should contact your tour operator and travel insurer about what this means for you and your plans.
Data collection
Upon arrival you will be encouraged to sign up to the contact tracing app Rakning C-19. Further information, including how to download it, data usage, privacy and scope is available on the Rakning C-19 website.
Testing / screening on arrival
If you test positive on arrival you will be required to enter self-isolation (at your hotel or government-provided accommodation) unless further tests determine the infection is inactive.
You may also need to be tested again or enter self-isolation if you are exposed to a possible infection during your trip eg during the flight to Iceland.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Iceland and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Icelandic entry requirements. Check with the Icelandic Directorate of Immigration what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
if you stay in Iceland with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Iceland or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Icelandic border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Iceland as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in the Iceland your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Icelandic border control. For further information, see our Living in Iceland guide.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Iceland.
