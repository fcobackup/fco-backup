Travel to Zambia is subject to entry restrictions
Tourist visas to Zambia are only available in advance, not on arrival.
Temperature checking is routine on arrival. If your body temperature is 38.0 or higher, you will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival. If you have additional symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, shortness of breath, headache or sore throat) you will be taken to government facilities for treatment and quarantine.
All visitors must have proof that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the 14 days before their arrival in Zambia. There is no requirement for visitors to self-isolate on arrival.
All returning residents need to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival, and may be asked for proof of having tested negatively for COVID-19 in the previous 14 days.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
