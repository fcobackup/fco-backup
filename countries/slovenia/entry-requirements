The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Airports in Slovenia have now re-opened for passenger transportation. You should consult airlines for details of flight options, to and from Slovenia.
Passenger train connections between Slovenia and Austria have been suspended.
Individuals entering Slovenia are required to self-isolate for seven days, at an address which must be provided to the Slovene Border authorities. At the end of this period, you will be required to take a mandatory coronavirus test.
If you decline to take this test, you will be required to undertake a further isolation period of seven days. Travellers who are unable to specify the address at which they will spend the quarantine period, will be refused entry to Slovenia.
You will be required to provide evidence of legal documentation for the duration of your stay in Slovenia (such as an official work permit or a residency document). Failure to provide this information will result in entry being refused.
Individuals transiting Slovenia without a stopover are exempt from this requirement.
If you enter Slovenia you are advised to carry with you evidence of your reason for travel (for example, onward travel bookings; proof of residency; a work permit).
Neighbouring countries have introduced restrictions on entry from Slovenia. See travel advice for Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Italy.

If you remain in Slovenia, you should be aware that for stays longer than 90 days, you will be required to register as a Temporary Resident. This requires you to submit a form requesting temporary residency, which should be sent to the Slovene authorities via registered post as proof of your application.
Please contact the Uprava Enota (the department that handles these applications) at +386 1 306 3035 or at ue.ljubljana@gov.si. The department is open Monday to Thursday from 0800-1800, and on Friday from 0800-1400.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas  
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Slovenia. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Slovenia guide and contact the Slovene Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovenia.
