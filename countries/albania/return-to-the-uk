Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read what you can and cannot do

If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Albania, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Air Albania are operating a flight from Tirana to London on Monday 18 May at 12:00 (noon). To purchase a ticket, you must first call Air Albania (contact number +355 4 2246000) to secure a purchasing code. Once you have obtained a code, proceed to the Air Albania booking website
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Future travel options
At present there are no other flights planned to the UK after 18 May. We know this is concerning for British nationals trying to leave Albania. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Albanian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available to return to the UK as soon as possible.

If you are worried about overstaying in Albania due to international travel restrictions, you should send a request via e-mail to migracioni.tirane@asp.gov.al and policiakufitare@asp.gov.al and require an extension to your stay in Albania. You should attach your travel document to the e-mail. You should retain the confirmation e-mail as you will need to show it at the police checkpoint when you exit Albania once travel restrictions are removed.
Travelling to the airport
The Albanian authorities have suspended all public transport. Taxis will be allowed movement from Monday 27 April. If you are returning to the UK via Air Albania and you need to travel to Tirana International Airport, you should provide the private vehicle/taxi driver with a copy of your flight ticket in case he/she is stopped by the local police en route to the airport.

The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
