Uruguay has legalised the sale of marijuana by registered pharmacies for recreational use. However, this is only available to Uruguayan nationals in possession of a licence. Tourists aren’t allowed to buy marijuana.
Uruguay was the first South American country to recognise same-sex civil unions. Same-sex marriage has been legal since 2013 and anti-discrimination laws have existed since 2003. It is common to see same-sex couples together in public, and incidents of hostility or discrimination against LGBT visitors are rare. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
