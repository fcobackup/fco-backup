Tropical cyclones
The tropical cyclone season in Mauritius normally runs from November to May. Cyclones can cause extensive damage to property. There is a well-structured system of phased warnings. You should follow advice issued by the local authorities. During a cyclone you are not allowed to leave your accommodation and car insurance policies often cease to be valid.
Monitor local weather updates at Mauritius Meteorological Services and from the World Meteorological Organisation. Information is also available on Telmet by dialling 8996 from land lines or 171 from mobiles.
See our Tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if youâ€™re likely to be affected by a tropical cyclone.
Landslides
Some areas are prone to landslides, especially during cyclones and torrential rains. Mauritius Meteorological Services distribute 5-stage landside warnings and local authorities may organise evacuations of threatened areas if necessary.
