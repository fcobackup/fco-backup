The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to Sri Lanka, due to the impact of the current economic crisis. This advice does not apply to airside transit through Sri Lanka’s international airport.
A State of Emergency has been declared and an island wide curfew imposed from 12pm on 14 July until 5am on 15 July. You should remain in your residence or hotel and not travel at this time. Those with a flight ticket will be able to travel to the airport. Sri Lanka is experiencing a severe economic crisis which has led to shortages of basic necessities including medicines, cooking gas, fuel and food. There is a major shortage of fuel (diesel and petrol) affecting transport, businesses, and emergency services. The 1990 Ambulance Service is being severely impacted and may not be able to respond or not immediately, especially in remote parts of the country. There are daily power cuts due to electricity rationing. This has led to protests and violent unrest. Further protests, demonstrations, roadblocks and violent unrest could occur at short notice. You should avoid political gatherings or protests and be wary of spontaneous large gatherings. See ‘Shortages’ and ‘Political Situation’ for more details.
