This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Tunisia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Tunisia
You must complete this Tunisian government short online questionnaire before travelling.
If you have been vaccinated, you must show official evidence of this to enter Tunisia. You must have been vaccinated:
At least 28 days before travelling (Janssen vaccine)
At least seven days before travelling (all other vaccines).
Proof of vaccination must be issued from the national health authority of your country of residence. (See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’).
Travellers over the age of 6 who have not been vaccinated must take either:
a PCR test less than 48 hours before travel;
or a rapid lateral flow test less than 24 hours before travel
and carry dated evidence of a negative result. This test must include a QR code.
Travellers over the age of 6 may be subject to random rapid or PCR tests on arrival. If the test is positive, the traveller will be required to self-isolate for five days. If symptoms persist, they will be required to isolate for a further two days.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Tunisia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Testing on arrival
Travellers over the age of 6 may be tested on arrival by the Tunisian authorities. If they receive a positive result they will be obliged to self-isolate for five days. If symptoms persist, this period will be extended to seven days. See the ‘Entry to Tunisa’ section for full details.
Data collection
You must complete this Tunisian government short online questionnaire before travelling.
On arrival in Tunisia, you must also share your contact details and travel information with authorities.
Testing on departure
No testing is available at the airport or sea ports. Passengers travelling from Tunisia, who require a test for the country they are travelling to, should arrange a private test.
There have been some reports of travellers from Tunisia being denied entry to a third country, on suspicion of carrying fake test results. This may affect you if you are transiting in one country before onward travel to the UK.
For verification, travellers are advised to carry the original copy of their negative test result, and ensure this has been signed and stamped by the laboratory, before travelling. A QR code on test results must also be provided.
Transiting Tunisia
Transit flights are operating through Tunisia. If you are transiting through Tunisia, you must comply with sanitary measures and temperature checks.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa for visits of up to three months. On arrival, security checks are sometimes carried out on British passport holders who were not born in the UK. This can take a few hours and you will need to be patient until clearance is given. These types of checks rarely take place on departure.
Overstay fines
If you stay in Tunisia for longer than the authorised period, you will have to pay a fine. This rule may not apply if you are vulnerable and current circumstances oblige you to remain in the country.
Passport validity
For stays of up to 3 months your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
Tunisian authorities accept UK ETDs for entry to and exit from Tunisia. If you’re leaving Tunisia on an ETD, make sure you have a copy of the police report about the loss/theft of your full validity passport to present to the Immigration Officer.
Dual nationals
Dual British-Tunisian nationals should enter and leave Tunisia on their Tunisian passports.
