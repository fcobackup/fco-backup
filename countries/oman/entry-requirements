The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British nationals need a visa to enter Oman. You should apply for an e-visa before you travel. Applications can be made through the Royal Oman Police portal. If you’re travelling as a tourist, you can apply for an unsponsored visa. For all other visas, please follow the guidance on the portal.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Oman.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry, exit and transit in Oman however they must have at least 6 months’ remaining validity. Residents and tourists will need to get an exit stamp before leaving. This can cause delays and may prevent you from leaving on your booked flight. Check your passport carefully to make sure it’s legal and valid so that you don’t need an Emergency Travel Document.
Travelling with medication
Some prescribed and over the counter medicines available in the UK are banned substances in Oman. If you are travelling to Oman with prescription drugs, carry a copy of the prescription. For further information, check with Oman’s Ministry of Health well in advance of travel.
Yemen border
The border with Yemen remains open, but you may experience delays, before being considered for entry into Oman. The Omani border authorities may ask for proof of onward travel out of Oman before allowing you to enter the country. You’ll also be expected to be able to cover the cost of accommodation, insurance and onward travel. The UK government’s ability to help is limited.
