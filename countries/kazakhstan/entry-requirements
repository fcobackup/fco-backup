This page has information on travelling to Kazakhstan.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Kazakhstan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Kazakhstan’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
UK nationals no longer need a visa to enter Kazakhstan. But this could change at short notice if the COVID-19 situation changes.
You will need to provide details of where you are staying in Kazakhstan and confirm you will abide by all coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Effective from 8 June 2022, Kazakhstan has removed the requirement of COVID-19 vaccination and PCR certificates for entry.
Proof of vaccination status
Kazakhstan recognised the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record; however, from 8 June 2022 you are not required to show proof of vaccination when travelling to Kazakhstan.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
The PCR certificate requirement for entry into Kazakhstan has been removed.
If you’re travelling from the UK, you do not need to quarantine when arriving in Kazakhstan
If you test positive while in Kazakhstan you will need to self-isolate for 10 days. Those needing medical assistance may be confined in state facilities.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Kazakh embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
From 8 June 2022 you do not need to show your proof of vaccination, proof of having had COVID-19 in the past or a PCR certificate for entry into Kazakhstan.
Children and young people
There are no specific requirements for children and young people.
If you’re transiting through Kazakhstan
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Transiting through Kazakhstan is permitted for travellers who meet the requirements of their final destination.
If you are transiting through Kazakhstan on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day, you need to follow normal entry procedures
Further information about transiting through Kazakhstan can be found on the Kazakhstan Embassy or MFA website.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Visas
You can stay in Kazakhstan without a visa for up to 30 calendar days. A number of visits is unlimited, but a total period of stay without a visa should not exceed 90 calendar days within a 180-day period.
You should contact your nearest Kazakh Embassy for further information.
If you do need a visa, make sure you have the right visa for the purpose of your travel, especially for business visas or work permits. Check the validity dates of your visa and any associated restrictions carefully before you travel.
Registration
Since 10 January 2020, it has been the responsibility of the host person or hotel to notify immigration authorities of a foreigner’s arrival. This should be made within three working days from the date of the guest’s arrival in country and can be done online on the Visa and Migration portal or in writing to the Migration Service.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of three months beyond the expiry date of your visa. Your passport should also have at least 1 blank page for your visa.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Kazakhstan. If using an ETD to leave Kazakhstan, you may need to get an exit visa from the Migration Service (formerly the OVIR). This process can take five working days or longer. Check with the Migration Service for more information before confirming your travel plans.
Dual nationality
Dual nationality is not recognised in Kazakhstan. If you enter Kazakhstan on a Kazakh passport and also hold British nationality the British Embassy can only provide very limited consular assistance. In cases of arrest or detention, consular access is unlikely to be granted.
Customs
The Government of Kazakhstan imposes limits on how much foreign currency can be imported or exported, and certain goods are subject to custom regulations. For further information please visit the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
