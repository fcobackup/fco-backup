This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Cambodia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Cambodia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Royal Embassy of Cambodia in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Cambodia.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Cambodia your passport must be:
valid for at least 6 months from the date you arrive in Cambodia
undamaged and complete – entry is normally refused if you have a damaged passport or pages missing
If you apply to renew or extend your visa from within Cambodia, your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from the start date of that subsequent renewal or extension.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visa requirements
You will need a visa to enter and travel through Cambodia as a visitor.
Check with the Royal Embassy of Cambodia for the latest information on fees, conditions and photograph requirements.
Tourist visas are valid for 30 days from the date of entry into Cambodia. Make sure your passport is stamped on arrival and keep the departure form. If you lose your departure form, you’ll need to contact immigration officials before you leave the country to make alternative arrangements.
Applying for a visa
Apply for an e-visa at least 4 days in advance.
If you do not get an e-visa, you can get a visa on arrival at airports or land border crossings. You need to provide a photo and pay in US dollars.
You can also get an extension of a tourist visa while you are in Cambodia.
You can be fined, detained and deported if you overstay your visa. There is no limit to this fine. If you overstay more than 30 days, you will need to leave Cambodia and pay the fine.
Electronic arrival card
From 1 September 2024, Cambodia will implement an electronic Arrival Card.  If you are entering Cambodia by air at either Phnom Penh, Siem Reap or Sihanoukville international airports, you must complete and submit an electronic e-Arrival Card within 7 days prior to your arrival. There is no charge for this.
Work permits
To work in Cambodia, you need a business visa and a work permit. Business visas are issued by the immigration department and are available:
on arrival in Phnom Penh airport
at the immigration department
in advance from a Cambodian embassy
Your employer will need to apply for your work permit from the Department of Labour and Social Affairs.
The Cambodian government strictly enforces these rules, so you should ask the relevant department for the latest advice.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Cambodia, you must have a certificate/certificates to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Cambodia guide.
Registering with the authorities
The Cambodian Department of Immigration runs an online registration app called the Foreigners Present in Cambodia System (FPCS). If you fail to get yourself registered, you may be unable to extend your visa if you want to.
If you’re staying in a hotel, guesthouse or rented accommodation, make sure the manager or landlord registers you using the app.
If you are staying with friends or family or own your own home in Cambodia, you will need to register yourself, using the app for Android or iOS. You need to enter a Cambodian phone number for your registration to be valid.
