If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Honduras without needing to test or quarantine.
You will need to show evidence that you have received a COVID-19 vaccine (vaccination card) indicating you have received two doses (or one dose if vaccinated with a one dose vaccine). The last dose must have been administered more than 14 days prior to the date of travel. The vaccine must be approved by the Honduras Ministry of Health or World Health Organisation.
Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Honduras with the Honduran Embassy in the UK.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to qualify for entry to Honduras as a vaccinated traveller. If you do not have proof you will be treated as if you’re not vaccinated.
Honduras will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative PCR or Antigen test (taken no more than 72 hours before entry) when entering Honduras. See information on getting a test before entry.
Find out if you qualify as fully vaccinated in Honduras with the Honduran Embassy in the UK.

If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past month
If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past month, you must present a negative antigen test (taken no more than 72 hours prior travelling). If for some reason your result still shows as positive, you must present a medical certificate from the health clinic where you were treated, stating the date you were diagnosed with COVID-19 (including the copy of the test) and confirmation of your recovery. This is applicable whether you are fully vaccinated or not.

Children travelling with only one parent or without either parents or legal guardians must present a notarised letter of consent from the non-travelling parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to enter and exit Honduras. Contact the nearest Embassy or Consulate of Honduras, or if you are in Honduras the nearest National Institute of Migration, for information about the process and language requirements for consent documents.
Central America Border Control Agreement
Honduras is party to the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4). Under the terms of this agreement, British tourists can travel within any of the CA-4 countries (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua) for a period of up to 90 days which starts at the first point of entry of any of the CA-4 countries. They will be subject to immigration checks at the border (which does not interrupt or restart the 90-day count). Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90-day limit, although a request for an extension can be made for up to 30 days by paying a fee before the 90 day limit expires. If you are expelled from any of the four countries you are also excluded from the entire CA-4 region.
Land borders
If you arrive or depart at a land border, the immigration authorities may charge you a fee of US$3 at the border crossing. Keep the receipt until you leave the country and make sure your passport is stamped.
You may experience some disruptions at the land border crossings between Honduras and Guatemala, due to the passage of migrant caravans.
