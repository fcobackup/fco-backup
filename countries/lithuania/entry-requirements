The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Lithuania
British nationals resident in the UK will need to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival in Lithuania. British nationals travelling to Lithuania by air, sea, bus or train from any overseas destination, including the UK, will need to complete an online registration form prior to arrival.
People arriving in Lithuania by private vehicles or on foot must complete the online registration form within 12 hours of arriving in Lithuania.
On arrival in Lithuania from a country designated as affected by COVID-19, you must self-isolate for 14 days. Information on countries designated as affected is updated weekly and can be found on the Lithuanian Government Korona Stop website
The self-isolation period can be shortened from 14 to 10 days if you gain a negative COVID-19 PCR test on or after your 8th day of self-isolation. You can register for a PCR test by calling the COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963. The hotline is open daily between 8 am and 11 pm. You must not use public transportation to travel to the testing centre.
Arrivals from Poland and Estonia are not required to self-isolate when travelling for work, studies, agricultural activities or health care.
The movement of goods is not restricted.
Quarantine requirements
British nationals resident in the UK must self-isolate for 14 days on arrival in Lithuania.
British nationals travelling to Lithuania from a country designated as affected by COVID-19 must self-isolate for 14 days. The list of countries from which self-isolation is required is published on the Lithuanian Government Korona Stop website.
The self-isolation period can be shortened from 14 to 10 days if you gain a negative COVID-19 PCR test on or after your 8th day of self-isolation. You can register for a PCR test by calling the COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963. The hotline is open daily between 8am and 11pm. Please note that the option to shorten isolation does not apply to those who are known to have had contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the last 14 days.
You must not use public transportation to travel to the testing centre. If you do not have access to a private vehicle, you will need to travel to the testing centre by taxi. You are advised to check at the time of booking whether the taxi company is able to take you to a testing centre, as some taxis may not have the precautions in place to provide this service.
While in isolation, you must:
not leave your place of isolation without the permission of a healthcare professional;
not attend public gatherings, shops or public services;
not have guests/visitors;
organise for essential provisions to be delivered by friends, family or delivery services;
consult with a GP by phone/email to arrange extensions to prescriptions; and
call the Emergency Response Centre on 112, or COVID-19 hotline on +370 37367 963, if you develop symptoms of COVID-19. The hotline is open daily between 8am and 11pm.
While in isolation, you may be contacted by Lithuanian health officials.
The Lithuanian Government advises against isolating in properties shared by others who have not travelled from a high risk country. If this is not possible, you should stay in separate, well-ventilated rooms, restrict your movement within the home and minimise use of common spaces.
Those self-isolating on arrival from a country deemed high risk, but who are not known to have had contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case and do not have COVID-19 symptoms, may go for walks within a 1km radius of their place of isolation. You must wear a covering on your face and mouth, avoid contact with other people and not enter public buildings (such as shops, restaurants or museums) or attend public events. If you are contacted by Lithuanian health officials while on a walk, you must return immediately to your place of isolation.
British nationals needing to temporarily break isolation, may submit a request to Lithuanian National Public Health Centre (NVSC) at least 7 days in advance. Individuals registering for a COVID-19 PCR test through the COVID-19 hotline do not require separate permission to attend the test from the NVSC.
British nationals needing to leave Lithuania before the end of your isolation period in order to return to the UK/your country of residence for medical treatment must inform the NVSC at least 24 hours before departure.
Failure to comply with self-isolation requirements could result in a fine of between 60 and 1,500 Euros.

Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Lithuania. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Lithuania guide and contact the Lithuanian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
You will be able to travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.
Therefore, if you’re travelling to Lithuanian, previous visits to the Schengen area within the 180 days before your date of travel would count against the 90-day limit.
If you are travelling visa-free to Lithuanian and to other countries in the Schengen area, make sure your whole visit is within the limit.
To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Lithuanian. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You should check with the Lithuanian Embassy what type of visa, if any, you will need.
Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit.
The European Commission has not yet set out how the limit of 90 days in any 180-day period for visa-free travel will be implemented for those who are already travelling in the EU or Schengen Area on 31 December 2020.
If you are travelling to Lithuanian before 31 December 2020 and will stay until 1 January 2021 or later, you should check with the Lithuanian Embassy for information on how the 90-day visa-free limit will apply to you. This also applies if your stay includes travel to other Schengen area countries.
At border control for Lithuanian, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Lithuania.
