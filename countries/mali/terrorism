There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorists are very likely to try and carry out attacks in Mali.   
Several terrorist groups operate in the region, including Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) and Islamic State Sahel.  JNIM have publicly stated their intent to carry out attacks in Bamako, the capital of Mali. 
Terrorist attacks have expanded in frequency and geographic coverage with the deteriorating security situation. Violence targeting civilians in multiple simultaneous offences increased significantly in 2023, compared to 2022.  The UN peacekeeping mission was asked to leave Mali, with troop withdrawal to be completed by the end of 2023.  
Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur at any time, including in places frequented by foreigners, such as:
military sites and institutions
government buildings
international institutions
transport hubs
embassies
religious sites and places of worship
sporting and cultural events
shopping centres and crowded places
Take particular care during periods of national or religious significance, such as Ramadan and Eid. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
Examples of recent significant attacks include:
On 13 December 2023, at least 40 Malian soldiers and Dozo hunters were killed in a militant attack in Farabougou village in the central Segou region.
On 5 and 6 December, militants perpetrated three attacks in the south-central regions of Segou and San resulting in a number of deaths and wounding others.
On 26 November, at least 10 people were killed during a raid on Allaye Kokollo village in central Mali by suspected militants.
On 6 November, a project worker for a humanitarian organisation, Action Against Hunger, was killed in Gao Region.
On 3 November, a roadside bomb killed three people and wounded 16 others in the Cercle de Bankass, in Mali’s central region of Bandiagara.
37 UN peacekeepers were seriously injured by IEDs during their convoy’s journey from Kidal to Gao from 31 October to 7 November, as part of MINUSMA’s withdrawal from Mali.
In September 2023, more than 60 people were killed in a suspected jihadist attack on a river boat near the village of Abakoira in the north of Mali.
In August to September 2023, JNIM frequently shelled Timbuktu, including the airport, resulting in the suspension of some flights.
On 22 July 2022, there was an attack on the Kati military base, 15km from Bamako city centre, killing one soldier. Seven attackers were also killed.
On 18 June 2022, terrorists attacked the villages of Diallassagou, Dianweli and Deguessagou, killing at least 132 civilians.
This continues a historic trend of terrorists attacking military bases and personnel, sometimes including foreign military, often leading to the deaths of soldiers, civilians, and others.
Terrorist Kidnap
There is a very high threat of kidnapping by al-Qa’ida and Islamic State-aligned groups in Mali. These include Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) and Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP). These groups operate throughout Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. JNIM, in particular, has previously conducted kidnappings from all parts of Mali, including in urban areas and in the capital, Bamako. 
If you are working or travelling in Mali, be aware of the very high threat of terrorist kidnapping. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times, including when travelling and in crowded public places, including camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and places of worship, markets, and shopping areas, and places frequented by westerners like hotels, bars, nightclubs, restaurants and transport hubs. You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place
British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release. 
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.
