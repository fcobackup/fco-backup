Accommodation
Most hotels in the main tourist areas of Punta Cana, Santo Domingo and Puerta Plata are closed. The British Embassy is in close contact with the hotels association and monitoring the situation.
You should check our social media channels (Facebook and Twitter) regularly for updates on hotels.
Visas
During the current coronavirus measures, you can extend a tourist visa for up to 120 days. This can be done online at the Dominican Directorate General for Migration website or at the airport on departure.
The British Embassy is working with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will request a waiver of the visa extension fee where possible. Contact the Embassy on UK.inDominicanRepublic@fco.gov.uk before your flights to see if this applies in your case.
Health
If you develop coronavirus symptoms whilst in the Dominican Republic, you should seek medical assistance and follow the advice of local authorities. Should you test positive for coronavirus, you must self-isolate for a period of 14 days. For further information and guidance, consult the dedicated government website. There is also an information and advice hotline that can be reach by dialing 462. Both of these services are in Spanish. There may be a limited number of call operators that can assist in English.

Help and support
