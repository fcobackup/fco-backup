Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Pakistan. The Pakistani authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
Entry and travel restrictions
For information on how to return to the UK from Pakistan, see Return to the UK.
We understand that the Pakistani authorities have closed land borders with Afghanistan, China, India and Iran. Border crossings with Iran have opened occasionally to allow Pakistani nationals to return home. Border crossings with Afghanistan open a number of times a week, but for outward goods transport only. Those crossing into Pakistan may have to comply with COVID-19 testing and quarantine measures.
Screening measures for international air arrivals
International air passengers travelling to Pakistan will be subject to thermal screening on arrival. Passengers displaying a high-temperature or other COVID-19 symptoms may be transported directly to quarantine in hospital. All other passengers will be transported to a designated holding centre to be quarantined, and tested for COVID-19 after 24 hours. Passengers will only be released after results are returned. We understand that this entire process may take up to two days. Before travelling, you should ensure that you have a form of payment for food and water during this quarantine and testing period.
Incoming passengers who test positive for COVID-19 may be subject to compulsory isolation or quarantine. People who have come into contact with others with COVID-19 symptoms may also be isolated or quarantined. Those that test negative will still have to self-isolate at home, and should follow local authority guidelines.
Passengers on flights to Pakistan may also be required to follow special measures before boarding, and while on board the aircraft, including the wearing of a surgical mask.
Reinforcement of screening and administrative measures at all sea ports has been announced.
Domestic flights
Domestic flight operations are suspended until 21 April. Despite this, the Government of Pakistan has permitted some flights between Islamabad and Gilgit-Baltistan to continue. Cargo and special flights are also exempted from these restrictions.
Social measures
Pakistani authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus, including school closures. There are strict restrictions on public gatherings, including religious congregations, events in wedding halls, and sports matches. Some provincial authorities are introducing additional measures, including requiring residents to stay at home, and closing shops, restaurants and other public places. Most public transport has been suspended, and in some places there are limits on the number of people allowed to be in one car. Measures are particularly strict in Sindh and Punjab. There have been reports of patrols and check points to enforce these measures, and some provinces have reportedly introduced powers to fine or arrest anyone breaking the rules.
Some provinces are also imposing compulsory isolation or quarantine for people who have COVID-19 symptoms, or people who have come into contact with others with COVID-19 symptoms. In some cases, local authorities are quarantining specific areas.
You should follow the federal and relevant provincial guidance, and monitor local media for updates. Plan any movements accordingly.
If you are running out of medication or have medical needs, you should speak to your travel insurance company for advice and seek local medical assistance, including from pharmacies. Your GP / UK doctor may be able to advise of alternative medication if yours is not available in Pakistan.
Further information
The Pakistani authorities have announced a helpline (on phone number 1166) for people who have recently travelled to China, Iran or a country where COVID-19 is present and who have symptoms like fever, cough and difficulty breathing. British nationals who are worried about the virus, or suspect they may have contracted it, should contact that number and follow the guidance given by the authorities.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
