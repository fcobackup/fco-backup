Crime
Crime levels are low, but there are occasional incidents of petty crime against tourists. Take particular care of your passport, avoid carrying valuables with you and do not leave possessions in unattended vehicles, even if out of sight in a locked boot.
Following an incident in September 2014, the police advise individuals against hiking alone in the forest, including at well-known recreation areas.
Road travel
Drivers of vehicles not registered in Brunei can only purchase motor fuel at 10 designated filling stations throughout the country, to a maximum of 250 litres. Filling a foreign car is more expensive as the purchase price does not include a government subsidy.
You can drive in Brunei with a UK driving licence as long as it is endorsed by the Brunei Land Transport Department in the Ministry of Communications. Alternatively, you can use an International Driving Permit (for up to three months).
Driving standards differ from the UK. Traffic will not always stop at red lights or pedestrian crossings. Speeding and non use of seatbelts is common. Road conditions are generally good but you should take extra care while driving through heavy rain as road surfaces are uneven.
If you are involved in a road accident as a driver, you should not leave the scene or move the vehicle until the police have attended.   
Trekking
It is easy to get lost when visiting the rainforest. Use recognised and well-known guides, and stay on the footpaths.
Political Situation
Avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings of people. Keep yourself informed of developments, and if you become aware of any nearby protests, leave the area immediately.
