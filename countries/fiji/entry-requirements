The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the Embassy, High Commission or Consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
The Fiji government has announced changes to International travel due to COVID-19. The Fiji border remains closed to British tourists. Only residents and Fijian citizens are allowed to return to Fiji.
Returning residents and citizens must request permission to enter Fiji from the COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Taskforce (CRMT). To do this you will need to email the following documents to crmt@govnet.gov.fj :
letter addressed to the Chair COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Taskforce providing background to your request
copy of passport bio-data page
copy of the valid work permit or provide the approval letter by Immigration that was given for the work permit
proposed itinerary
confirmation you are willing to enter a government-mandated quarantine facility for 14 days
evidence of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test (for a nasopharyngeal sample taken not more than 72 hours before departure). The test result must be in the form of the complete report from the laboratory that performed the test
All foreign nationals who are currently stranded in Fiji have been advised to contact Fiji Immigration Office so that they could be properly guided to maintain their legal status. This applies to all categories of permit holders.
These restrictions supersede the regular entry requirements set out below which refer to Fiji’s requirements that existed before the border was closed.
Further information can be found the Fiji government website.

Travelling with children
Some countries require documentary evidence of parental responsibility before allowing lone parents to enter the country or, in some cases, before permitting the children to leave the country.
