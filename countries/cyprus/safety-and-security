Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Terrorism in Cyprus
Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Cyprus, attacks cannot be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.
Political Demonstrations
Demonstrations may occur with little or no warning in cities. Events in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories have led to heightened tensions in the region and demonstrations are likely.  Avoid any protests, political gatherings, or marches and leave the area if one develops. Local transport routes may be disrupted.
Political situation
The Republic of Cyprus is a full EU member, but the country is divided by the Green Line. The British government do not recognise the self-declared ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’.
Crime
Crime against tourists is not common but take sensible precautions. Keep passports, money and other valuables safe.
Drink spiking
Personal attacks, including sexual assaults, are infrequent but do happen. Drug-assisted rape is a risk, including with drugs like GHB and liquid ecstasy. Buy your own drinks and always keep sight of them. Avoid splitting up from your friends.
Laws and cultural differences
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Cyprus has a strictly enforced zero-tolerance policy towards illegal drugs, which includes laughing gas. If you are caught with drugs, you may receive a fine or a prison sentence.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex relationships are legal in the Republic of Cyprus and civil partnerships are recognised. However, they may not be as widely accepted as in the UK. Same-sex relationships are legal in the north of Cyprus, but not widely accepted. Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Dual nationals
If you are of Cypriot descent, even if you do not have a nationality card, authorities may consider you eligible for military service. If this happens, you could have difficulties when exiting Cyprus, and you might have to prove that you live outside Cyprus.
Under international law, the British High Commission cannot intervene with Cypriot authorities on behalf of those considered to be dual Cypriot/British nationals. If you might be eligible for any local obligations or duties that apply to dual nationals, such as military service, contact the Cypriot authorities or a local lawyer before you travel.
The British High Commission website has lists of English-speaking lawyers in Cyprus and lawyers in the north of Cyprus.
Surrogacy
If you are visiting Cyprus to arrange an international surrogacy, consider the risks and challenges involved. Surrogacy is a complex and lengthy process. You should:
make sure you are fully aware of the facts and well-prepared before starting the process
seek specialist legal advice on Cyprus and UK laws prior to making any arrangements
read FCDO and Home Office guidance on surrogacy overseas including issues you might have to deal with
research clinics and hospitals thoroughly to ensure they are safe and reputable
The British High Commission cannot get involved in surrogacy arrangements or recommend hospitals or clinics.
Commissioning a surrogacy will not automatically mean that the child holds British citizenship. If you want to bring your child born through surrogacy from Cyprus to the UK, you must apply for a full British passport. You will need a Cypriot birth certificate to apply. The maximum period of visa-free stay allowed by the Cypriot authorities is 90 days within a 180-day period.
International parental child abduction
The authorities in the north of Cyprus do not act on British court orders. They will not share information with the British High Commission on children subject to UK court orders. This means the British High Commission cannot ensure that these children are properly safeguarded.
Using cameras in secure areas
Avoid taking photographs near sensitive areas, such as military buildings. You could be arrested for doing so.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Swimming safety
Bathing is generally safe, but there can be strong waves and currents. Always follow warning signs and only swim on approved beaches.
Adventure sports, including quad biking
If you do any extreme or adventure sports, water sports or diving, you should:
get the right travel insurance – if quad biking, make sure it includes quad bike rental to avoid paying costs of private healthcare or repatriation to the UK
always check the details of your insurance cover before you travel, including the exclusions
only use properly licensed and insured operators and satisfy yourself that adequate safety precautions are in place
never hand over your passport as a guarantee against the return of equipment
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Cyprus, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC guide.
Car insurance
Many cars hired in the Republic of Cyprus are not insured for use in the north of Cyprus. Check with your insurance company as you will not be allowed through a crossing without the correct insurance documents. At some crossing points it is possible to buy car insurance for the north of Cyprus. This includes the Agios Dometios.
Licences and permits
You need either a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) or a UK driving licence to drive in Cyprus. The 1949 IDP is not accepted any more. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You can buy an IDP in person from some UK post offices – find your nearest post office branch that offers this service.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. Check guidance on displaying number plates for more information.
Road safety
Driving standards are poor and there is an increased risk of road deaths compared to the UK.
If you hire a vehicle, check:
it is in good condition and roadworthy
you have the right insurance – hire companies renting mopeds and quad bikes usually only provide third-party insurance, so you will have to pay for any damage to the vehicle (and may be arrested if you do not pay)
you have appropriate safety equipment
Rental companies often ask for your passport as a deposit, which is illegal. Never hand over your passport in this way.
Driving rules
You could be heavily fined if you:
drive or are a passenger without wearing a seat belt
ride a motorbike without a crash helmet
use a mobile while driving
are found to be drink driving
Extreme weather and natural disasters
The Department of Meteorology of Cyprus issues warnings for severe weather, especially during summer. Weather can sometimes cause travel disruption. Monitor local and international updates and severe weather warnings from the Cyprus Department of Meteorology or European meteorological services, and check with your travel provider if necessary. Always follow the advice of local authorities.
Forest fires and wildfires
Forest fires and wildfires often occur during the summer months due to dry and hot weather.
Wildfires are dangerous and unpredictable. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas. Put out cigarette ends properly, and do not light barbecues outside of designated areas. If you see a fire, call the emergency services on 112 or 1407.
Get more information on wildfires from the Department of Forests website.
Earthquakes
Cyprus experiences earthquakes and tremors. Make sure you know safety procedures and follow advice given by the local authorities.
