The Peruvian authorities provide guidance on public health centres in Lima and laboratories that process tests in the country (only available in Spanish). COVID-19 PCR tests are widely available in both public clinics and private labs in Peru. Some regions in Peru, outside Lima, do not have private lab facilities and rely entirely on public facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Peru
A state of emergency continues to be in force in Peru due to COVID-19.
The Peruvian government operates a four-tier system of restrictions (Extreme, Very High, High and Moderate). There is a requirement to wear two masks (one cloth, one surgical) or a KN95 mask in shops and other indoor public spaces. The use of masks outdoors is optional in some regions, according to its vaccination rates, but still required in others. Please follow local authorities’ instructions.
Adults must show evidence of having received a booster dose to enter most indoor venues, if they reside in Peru. This can be provided on paper or digitally, and foreign vaccination certificates (including those issued by the NHS) are accepted. Masks must also be worn as specified above. Children aged 5 and over will be allowed to enter sports stadiums and other venues if they show evidence of having been fully vaccinated either in Peru or abroad. All domestic air passengers aged 12 and over will be allowed to board only if they show evidence of having been fully vaccinated either in Peru or abroad. Adults must show evidence of having received a booster dose if they reside in Peru. Alternatively, they can show proof of a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR (molecular) test, issued a maximum of 48 hours before boarding. Under 12s old must be without COVID-19 symptoms but do not require a test or proof of vaccination. All interprovincial land transport passengers aged 12 and over must show evidence of full vaccination. Adults must also show evidence of having received a booster dose if they reside in Peru. Alternatively, they can show proof of a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR (molecular) test, issued a maximum of 48 hours before boarding. When you show your proof of vaccination, you will be required to show an ID document as well.
For information on the tiers and restrictions in each area, you should visit the El Peruano website. Restrictions may change at short notice – you should follow official guidance and the local media for updates. Fines may be imposed for those breaking the rules.
Public places and services
Public places and services may be closed, depending on the tier level of the region.
