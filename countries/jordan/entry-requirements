The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Jordan
Jordan’s international airport re-opened to scheduled flights on 10 September. Passengers must register to travel on the Visit Jordan website and have PCR tests before departure, on arrival and during the period of self quarantine.
Strict quarantine rules are in place depending on the country of origin. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Countries are categorised by an epidemiological scale of the COVID-19 outbreak. The government of Jordan will review a list of countries and categories every fourteen days. This can be checked on the Visit Jordan website.
Transiting Jordan
There are currently limited flights operating to and from Jordan. All passengers arriving at Queen Alia Airport Jordan will need to follow instructions set out by Government of Jordan.
Testing / screening on arrival
All passengers, including Jordanians, arriving in Jordan by special repatriation flights or via land borders will be PCR tested at their own cost.
There are additional PCR testing requirements during the period of self quarantine in Jordan. Testing requirements are subject to change with little or no notice. Please check the requirements listed on the Visit Jordan website
Quarantine requirements
From 23 September, passengers arriving in to Jordan are no longer subject to institutional quarantine, but will be required to complete self-isolation even if their PCR test result is negative. Passengers arriving from the green and yellow category countries are required to self-isolate for one week even if their PCR test result is negative. Arrivals from the red category countries are required to self-isolate for two weeks even if their PCR test result is negative.
Data collection
The Government have announced that on arrival in Jordan you will need to provide your contact details, travel information and complete passenger health declaration and locator forms. Passengers arriving will need to install Aman.jo application on their mobile device. This will inform the user if they had contact with an infected person, so the user can seek appropriate medical attention.
Testing on departure
There is no testing requirement on departure, although the Government advises travellers to comply with coronavirus regulations in the destination country.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You’ll need a visa to enter Jordan. You can buy a single entry visa valid for 1 month on arrival at the airports or the Sheikh Hussein/North Border crossing at the Jordan/Israel border.
Check with the Jordanian authorities if you’re planning to cross the Wadi Araba/south border crossing (Aqaba/Eilat) or the Allenby/King Hussein Bridge.
An exit tax, currently 10JD, is payable at all border crossings, except the airports.
If you wish to combine travel to Jordan with a visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, it’s usually better to get a multiple entry visa before you travel from the Embassy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in London.
You can extend your visa after you arrive in Jordan up to a maximum period of 6 months. If you overstay your visa you will be fined. You can apply to extend your visa using the following website. Payment is accepted online.
If you’re entering for tourism you can get a combination of a visa and reduced cost entry to the major tourism sites by applying for a Jordan Pass online.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Jordan.
Previous travel to Israel
Evidence of a previous visit to Israel like an Israeli entry/exit stamp in your passport does not normally cause any difficulties when entering Jordan. It is, however, for the Jordanian authorities to determine the right of entry into the country. If you have any concerns, you should contact the Consulate of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in London.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
HIV test
You must undergo an HIV test if you intend to stay in Jordan for more than 30 days, either as a resident or as a long-term visitor. The fee to obtain the health certificate is currently 20 Jordanian Dinars.
Dual nationals
If you are a British/Jordanian national, you are allowed to use your British passport on arrival, but will need to show your Jordanian passport on departure.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK emergency travel documents are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Jordan. However, for entry and transit using an emergency travel document, you’ll need to get a visa from the Jordanian Embassy in the country where the document was issued. For exit using an emergency travel document, you’ll need to get a stamp from the Immigration & Residency department in Amman (not at the airport). A minimum of one month remaining validity is required on an emergency travel document.
