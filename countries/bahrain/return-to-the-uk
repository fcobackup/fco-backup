Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

There are direct flights from Bahrain to London Heathrow operated by Gulf Air, but at a reduced service. The schedule is under regular review and flights are subject to change or cancellation at short notice.
You should check with your airline or travel company for the latest information. If you are travelling in Bahrain, or otherwise wish to return to the UK, you are strongly advised to return now, where and while there are still commercial routes available.
Future travel options
The British Embassy is issuing regular updates on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook with advice and the latest available information on options for British nationals wishing to leave Bahrain.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
If you cannot leave Bahrain
If you cannot leave Bahrain at this time, see advice on staying in Bahrain during coronavirus.
