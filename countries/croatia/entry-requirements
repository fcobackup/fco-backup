This page has information on travelling to Croatia. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Croatia set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Croatia before travel.
Travellers are no longer required to complete an online entry form before arriving in Croatia.
Travellers are no longer required to show a COVID-19 vaccine certificate, proof of a negative test, or a certificate of recovery to enter Croatia.
If you’re fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Croatia are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
Proof of vaccination status
You don’t need to provide your vaccination status for entry to Croatia.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Croatia are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Entry requirements for Croatia are the same for all travellers, regardless of whether you have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past year.

Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
Croatia is not part of the Schengen area, Visits to Croatia do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in the Schengen area.
Visits to other EU or Schengen countries do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in Croatia.
You can travel to Croatia for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Croatian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Croatian Embassy in London as to what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Croatia for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Croatia with a Croatia residence permit or long-stay visa, this line does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for Croatia.
Passport stamping
As a visitor, your passport will be stamped when you enter and exit Croatia. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in Croatia.
If you enter or exit the Schengen area through Croatia as a visitor, check that your passport is stamped. This will show border guards that you are complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for Croatia and the separate 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.
If the relevant entry or exit stamp is not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit. If you show evidence e.g. transport tickets to prove when you entered or exited Croatia, border guards should add this entry or exit date and the location in your passport.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show proof of accommodation
show you have enough money for your stay
If you have a Withdrawal Agreement residency document for another country, your passport might still be stamped if you are a visitor to Croatia.
If you are resident in Croatia, read our Living in Croatia guide for passport stamping information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Croatia.
