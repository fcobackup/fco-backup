The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to South Korea
Foreign nationals who have been in Hubei province in China within the previous 14 days are not permitted to enter South Korea.
Transiting in South Korea
Transit passengers will receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport.
Testing / screening on arrival
All arrivals – regardless of nationality and length of stay – are required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) and to undergo quarantine for 14 days. All individuals regardless of nationality who show coronavirus symptoms on arrival will be tested. Those who test positive will be isolated and treated at a hospital or community treatment centre.
For those not showing symptoms on arrival, Korean nationals and long term foreign visitors with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence may self-quarantine at home. Arrivals from the USA and Europe must receive a test within three days; arrivals from elsewhere must receive a test within 14 days.
All other foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for 14 days on arrival. Arrivals from the USA and Europe will be tested on entry before transferring to the quarantine facility; arrivals from elsewhere will move to the quarantine facility and be tested within 14 days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 100,000KRW (approximately £66) while in government quarantine facilities. There is currently no charge for hospital/community centre treatment for those testing positive. It is worth noting that individuals testing positive on arrival may spend over a month in hospital/community treatment centres before successfully testing negative and being discharged.
You can find more information on Korean arrival procedures on the Government of the Republic of Korea website.
Data collection
There are very limited exemptions from the self-quarantine system for important – primarily COVID-19 related – business, humanitarian or academic purposes. You must receive approval before you travel from the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in the UK. Those with an exemption will still be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile App.
Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea.
If you display symptoms or return a positive test result for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you have a British Citizen passport you can enter South Korea as a tourist for up to 90 days without a visa. You must also have an onward or return ticket. It’s illegal to work on a tourist visa, whether as a teacher or in any other capacity.
If you have a different type of British nationality, or are travelling for any purpose other than tourism, you should check visa requirements with the Embassy of the Republic of Korea, London.
Long-term visa holders
From 1 June 2020, foreign nationals residing in South Korea on most types of long-term visa will need to apply for a re-entry permit at a local immigration office or at the airport before undertaking any travel out of South Korea. Those travelling with a re-entry permit will also be required to have a medical examination no earlier than 48 hours before they plan to return to South Korea, and to obtain a medical certificate in English or Korean to present to the Korean authorities on their arrival. The medical certificate must be signed by a medical professional at a recognised medical institution and include the date of the medical examination and either confirmation of a negative test for COVID-19 or a record of the presence or absence of fever, cough, chills, headache, breathing difficulty, muscle pain, and pulmonary symptoms. Long-term visa holders seeking to return to South Korea without a medical certificate may be refused entry.
Long-term visa holders leaving South Korea without a re-entry permit will have their visa and Alien Registration Card cancelled and will need to obtain a new long-term visa before they can re-enter South Korea.
Exceptions to this requirement include holders of A-1, A-2, A-3 and F-4 visas, or those issued with an Isolation Exemption Certificate by a Korean Embassy or consulate overseas.
For further information, call the Korean Immigration Contact Centre (Tel: 1345) or see the official announcement here.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 3 months from the date of entry into South Korea.
All foreigners living in South Korea are required to report any changes in their passport information (such as when receiving a new passport) either online using the Korean Immigration Office website or by visiting a local immigration office in South Korea. For further information, call the Korean Immigration Contact Centre (Tel: +82 1345).
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from South Korea.
Customs declarations
Check the website of the Korea Customs Service for information on restricted or prohibited items that may not be brought into the country. If you are in any doubt about the legality of any items - including medications - you should declare them on entry.
South Korean customs authorities allow you to bring small amounts of medication for your personal use, provided that it is kept in carry-on baggage. It is advised to take an English language prescription from your doctor at home for both your prescription drugs and non-prescription medicines. It is also a good idea to consult the website of the South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety before you travel to South Korea.
British males of Korean origin
If you are a British male of Korean origin whose name appears on the Korean family register, you may be liable for military service even if you are travelling on your British passport.
Employment
To get a visa to teach English in South Korea, you must have a 3-year university degree. A TEFL qualification alone is not sufficient. If you are found to have obtained a teaching visa by deception, you will be detained and deported.
British nationals teaching English in South Korea have sometimes found living and working conditions to be below expectations, and have encountered difficulties getting the correct visas and residence permits. There have also been complaints of breach of contract, confiscation of passports, payment being withheld and inadequate or no medical insurance. Check all terms and conditions of your employment carefully and if possible speak to other teachers from the place where you plan to work before accepting any offer.
For those in possession of a work visa, all employment changes must be authorised by Korean Immigration.
