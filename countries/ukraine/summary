The FCDO advises against all travel to Ukraine.
FCDO continues to advise British nationals against all travel to Ukraine. This is because the risks are too high.
Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against FCDO advice. Consular support is severely limited where FCDO advises against travel.
Russian invasion of Ukraine
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing, with attacks against a number of major cities, including Kyiv. Several towns and cities in southern and eastern Ukraine are temporarily under Russian control. Ukraine’s airspace is closed. There is a real risk to life.
There have been reports of military activity and shelling in the area of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. There have been no reports of any radiation release.
Flooding in the Kherson region following the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam on 6 June has caused widespread damage to infrastructure. There are serious risks to life and health from contaminated water, unexploded ordnance and debris. Those in the area should refer to the advice of local authorities for evacuations.
The situation in Ukraine can change quickly. Local rules and measures may change at short notice or with no notification. FCDO cannot confirm that all information here reflects the latest situation in Ukraine.
Leave Ukraine if safe to do so
We continue to advise British nationals still in Ukraine to leave now, if they judge it safe to leave. See our Returning to the UK page for information on leaving Ukraine.
Transport networks are likely to be severely disrupted. Expect increased documentation checks, transport restrictions and increased security measures. Other measures could include additional border controls, restrictions on public events, curfews, restrictions on telephones, internet and broadcasting, and evacuations of certain areas.
Ukrainian nationals and dual-national males aged 18-60 are prohibited from leaving the country.
If you are a dual British-Ukrainian national or you have the right to reside in the UK, and you are seeking to leave Ukraine, please contact the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine: adpsu@dpsu.gov.ua for advice.
If you cannot leave now
If the risks are too high (including if you are close to military activity) or you cannot leave for another reason you should:
stay indoors whenever possible
keep away from windows
monitor the media for developments that would allow you to leave safely
stay alert to air raid warnings and follow advice of the Ukrainian authorities
keep your departure plans under constant review
ensure your travel documents are up to date.
Martial law is in place. Follow the instructions of the Ukrainian authorities and check any measures in place in your location, as they will vary by region.

Help and support for British Nationals in Ukraine
The British Embassy is operating with a limited capacity in Kyiv. We cannot provide any in-person consular assistance.
If you require consular assistance in Ukraine, call our 24-hour helpline +380 (0)44 490 3660 (domestic call in Ukraine), +44 (0)20 7008 5000 (international call to the UK) and select the option for “consular services for British nationals,” or send an enquiry via the web contact form.
Full consular services are available in neighbouring countries.
Assisted departure or evacuation
The FCDO cannot facilitate your departure from Ukraine or evacuation. If you are in Ukraine against FCDO advice, or require support to leave Ukraine, take advice from a private security company and take appropriate security measures.
The FCDO cannot endorse or recommend any private security companies. You should research whether a service provider will be suitable for your requirements and meets code of conduct and safety standards. The Security in Complex Environments Group (SCEG) has several companies listed on their website. These companies have accredited certification for international standards.
The FCDO has not completed due diligence checks on these companies. The FCDO does not accept any liability arising to any person for any loss or damage suffered through using these service providers or this information. The FCDO is not able to provide financial assistance for employing private security or medical evacuation companies.
