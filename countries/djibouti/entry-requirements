This page has information on travelling to Djibouti.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Djibouti set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Djibouti’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy.
All travellers
You will need a visa to enter or travel through Djibouti as a visitor. See Visas
If you’re fully vaccinated
Provided you show evidence of having completed a first round of vaccination there are no additional requirements.
Foreign residents in Djibouti (as well as Djiboutian Nationals) are required to show evidence of vaccination to leave Djibouti.
Proof of vaccination status
Djibouti will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you have not completed a first round of vaccination or unable to produce evidence, you will need a PCR test certificate taken within 72 hours of the start of the journey and will have to take an additional PCR test on arrival that will cost $30.
You should not eat anything 30 minutes before your arrival at the entry point. You will have to pay for the test either by credit card, but as the credit card machines do not always work, cash (dollars, euros accepted) is a more reliable method of payment. If the test result is positive, you will be instructed on action to take – this might be going into quarantine, at your own expense, at a hotel agreed with those conducting the test or if showing symptoms into the hospital, until testing negative.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Entry requirements for Djibouti are the same for all travellers, regardless of whether you have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past year.
Children and young people
Children aged 10 years and below are not required to take PCR test on arrival. Those aged 24 years and under are not required to show evidence of having been vaccinated.
If you are transiting through Djibouti
If you are transiting through Djibouti on your way to another country and staying in the airport (airside) or on the plane there are no COVID-19 related requirements.
If you are transiting through Djibouti on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel for a flight the next day, you need to follow the requirements for entry into Djibouti.
Exemptions
There are exemptions on providing evidence of vaccination for those that can show evidence that health reasons mean they should not have the vaccine, those that are pregnant or breast feeding baby up to 6 months old, had COVID-19 less than four months before travel date.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Djibouti.
Visas
British nationals need a visa to enter Djibouti. You can buy a tourist visa on arrival at the airport with payment in cash, although the official Djiboutian government website has not been updated to reflect that on arrival visas were reintroduced in 2022. You can also apply online, before travelling, or contact a Djiboutian Embassy. You must have evidence of your onward journey.
