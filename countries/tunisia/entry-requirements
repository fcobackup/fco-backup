The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The Tunisian authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you should contact the Tunisian Embassy in London.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Tunisia
On 16 November, the Tunisian government changed the measures in place to limit the risk of travellers spreading COVID-19 on arrival in Tunisia. The rules you should follow are no longer determined by your nationality or the country from which you are travelling. Instead, there is one set of measures that applies to all people arriving in Tunisia. This is subject to change at short notice. You should check the latest rules with your airline or travel provider before travelling.
You are required to follow the Tunisian government’s COVID-19 health measures:
You must take a PCR test less than 72 hours before travel and show evidence of the negative test result, with the date of the test clearly labelled, at your point of departure for Tunisia. Children under 12 years old are exempt from this requirement. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test to facilitate your travel to another country. You should take a private test and ensure the test certificate includes the date of the test.
You must complete this Tunisian government short online questionnaire before travelling.
You must download and use the Tunisian government’s ‘track and trace’ application on your mobile phone.
On arrival, you must self-isolate at your place of residence, a government-approved hotel or quarantine centre for 14 days. You must pay for this accommodation yourself.
If you wish to pay for a second PCR test after 7 days, and this comes back negative, you will be permitted to leave quarantine early.
If your visit to Tunisia is for a maximum of 5 days, you are exempt from quarantine, although a PCR test remains compulsory.
The authorities have announced that they may assess your private accommodation to check whether it is suitable for quarantine. If they deem it unacceptable, you will be required to isolate at a hotel or quarantine centre at your own expense. No further details about how accommodation will be assessed have been provided.
Transiting Tunisia
A small number of transit flights are operating through Tunisia. If you are transiting through Tunisia, you must comply with sanitary measures and temperature checks.
Testing on arrival
All travellers will have their temperature checked on arrival in Tunisia and you could be randomly selected for a rapid test. If the result is positive, you must spend quarantine in a government-approved hotel or quarantine centre at your own expense.
Arrivals from all countries, including the UK, need to provide evidence of having taken a coronavirus PCR test that is negative less than 72 hours before your travel to Tunisia. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test and ensure the certificate is dated. See Entry to Tunisia for further details.
Quarantine requirements
All travellers to Tunisia need to self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival,unless your visit is for a maximum of 5 days. See Entry to Tunisia
Data collection
You must complete this Tunisian government short online questionnaire before travelling.
You must download and use the Tunisian government’s ‘track and trace’ application on your mobile phone.
On arrival in Tunisia, you must also share your contact details and travel information with authorities.
Testing on departure
No testing is available at the airport or sea ports. Passengers travelling from Tunisia, who require a test for the country they are travelling to, should arrange a private test.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa for visits of up to three months. On arrival, security checks are sometimes carried out on British passport holders who were not born in the UK. This can take a few hours and you will need to be patient until clearance is given. These types of checks rarely take place on departure.
Overstay fines
If you stay in Tunisia for longer than the authorised period, you will have to pay a fine. This rule may not apply if you are vulnerable and current circumstances oblige you to remain in the country.
Passport validity
For stays of up to 3 months your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
Tunisian authorities accept UK ETDs for entry to and exit from Tunisia. If you’re leaving Tunisia on an ETD, make sure you have a copy of the police report about the loss/theft of your full validity passport to present to the Immigration Officer.
Dual nationals
Dual British-Tunisian nationals should enter and leave Tunisia on their Tunisian passports.
