This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Guinea’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Guinea set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Guinean Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Guinea.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Guinea, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You must have a visa to visit Guinea for up to 90 days. Make sure you apply for the correct visa – British nationals have been refused entry with the wrong one.
Applying for a visa
You can apply online for an e-visa for private and business travel. You must apply several days in advance and upload scanned documents, including a yellow fever vaccination certificate. When you arrive in Guinea, take your e-visa registration receipt to the entry checkpoint, where border officials will issue your visa.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Guinea, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For more details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, including yellow fever, see TravelHealthPro’s Guinea guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Guinea. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Taking money into Guinea
There is no limit on cash you can bring into Guinea. When you leave, you cannot take more than 100,000 Guinean francs, or 5,000 US dollars or the equivalent in euros.
