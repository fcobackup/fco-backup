At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad. Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the FitForTravel website.
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website. You may then wish to contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad.
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For more information on travelling with medicines to Georgia, see Entry requirements. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the Georgian Embassy.
While travel can be enjoyable, it can sometimes be challenging. There are clear links between mental and physical health, so looking after yourself during travel and when abroad is important. Information on travelling with mental health conditions is available in our guidance page. Further information is also available from the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC).
Local medical care
The UK does not have a reciprocal healthcare agreement with Georgia.
Medical facilities in Tbilisi are available but can be expensive. Outside Tbilisi, medical facilities are limited.
Coronavirus
There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus. The virus originated in China, but cases have been confirmed in other countries, including Georgia.
There is enhanced monitoring of those arriving at ports of entry, and disruption to flights between mainland China and Georgia, and Iran and Georgia. Non-Georgian travellers arriving who have been in China or Iran in the last 14 days, regardless of the country of embarkation, will be refused entry to Georgia. All travellers will be subject to health monitoring on arrival, and could then be subject to mandatory follow up measures aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus. This could include being transferred to quarantine for 14 days. You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication and toiletries in carry-on luggage.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
You can find more information about cases in Georgia on the TravelHealthPro website.
Other health risks
Venomous snakes (vipers) are fairly common, particularly in early summer. Few medical facilities outside of major towns and cities have anti-venom.
Water quality is variable across Georgia. Bottled water is widely available.
Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 112 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company immediately if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.
