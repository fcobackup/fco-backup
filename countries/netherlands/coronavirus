Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. The Dutch Municipal Health Service (GGD) can only be used for testing if you have COVID-19 symptoms. See the Dutch Government’s website for more details of how and where to get tested for travel purposes. Always check that the type of test and the test result certificate meets the full testing requirements (e.g. name of the test provider and their contact details, if appropriate) for entry into either England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Netherlands is on the amber list for entering England. Check what you must do to enter England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.

Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

For other shared forms of transport, such as taxis, passenger vans and coaches, you must wear a face mask, unless you are the only passenger. If you’re travelling in a car or other private vehicle, you are advised to wear face masks if there are two or more people in the vehicle who belong to different households.
Children under the age of 13 are not required to wear a face mask.
Schiphol, Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in the Netherlands
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of The Netherlands announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Netherlands’ national vaccination programme started in January 2021 and is currently using Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) may also be available. British nationals resident in The Netherlands are eligible for vaccination including children over the age of 12. If you are considering a vaccination for somebody in this age group, you should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider. British Nationals aged 18-65 without a Citizen Services Number (BSN) can also be vaccinated. The Dutch government has issued information on the vaccination programme. If you are resident in the Netherlands, you should receive an invitation by letter or email when it is your turn to get the vaccination.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.

If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in the Netherlands, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations.
