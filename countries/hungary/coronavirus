See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Hungary.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities. A list of COVID-19 testing sites is outlined on the Hungarian National Centre for Public Health website (only available in Hungarian).
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Hungary
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Hungarian authorities have asked people to register their interest in receiving a vaccine on the https://vakcinainfo.gov.hu website. Once registered, the authorities will invite people for vaccination based on the order of priority determined by the national vaccination programme. You may check if your registration for the vaccine has been successful on the https://vakcinareg.neak.gov.hu/regisztracio/ website.
Those who have tested positive for coronavirus over the past 3 months can now also receive their first dose.
Vaccinated persons and those who have previously contracted the COVID-19 virus are eligible for a Hungarian Immunity Certificate.
If you have received your vaccination in Hungary but have not received your immunity certificate, you should check on the status of your certificate with your local government office (Kormanyablak) either in person or online (Hungarian Government Services System (Ügyfélkapu) account required). If they say that there is not enough information in their database about your vaccination, then you should ask the doctor who arranged your vaccine to check if your details are correctly entered in the Hungarian Electronic Health Service System (EESZT) as a foreigner, along with an ID number issued by your government.
If you are a permanent resident in Hungary and received your vaccination abroad (in the UK) and you would like to receive a Hungarian immunity certificate, you should reach out to your local government office (Kormanyablak) either in person or online (Hungarian Government Services System (Ügyfélkapu) account required) to register your vaccination and apply for an immunity certificate.
The Hungarian authorities have confirmed that all people resident in Hungary are eligible for vaccination, even those unable to register for a TAJ number.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
