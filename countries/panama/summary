The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Panama based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
From 4am on 15 January, visitors who have been in or transited through Panama in the previous 10 days cannot enter England. British and Irish nationals, and third country nationals with residence rights in the UK arriving in England from Panama will be required to quarantine in a hotel. Different rules apply for arrivals into Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
From 1 January onwards people with residence rights include: holders of Indefinite Leave to Remain; holders of existing leave to enter or remain (i.e those with biometric Residence permits) or an entry clearance/visa that grants such leave e.g. students, workers, etc (excluding visit visas); holders of EU Settlement Scheme (“EUSS”) leave; those who have rights of entry under the Withdrawal Agreements (including returning residents with a right of residence under the EEA Regulations and EEA frontier workers); family members of EEA nationals with rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.
Travel to Panama is subject to entry restrictions
International flights have resumed to and from Tocumen International Airport
Entry to Panama is closed to anyone, with the exception of Panamanian nationals and residents, that has been in either the United Kingdom or South Africa within 20 days of their arrival in the country
Panamanian nationals and residents that have been in the UK or South Africa in the past 20 days are allowed to enter Panama, but will either need to take a COVID-19 PCR test no more than 48 hours before they travel, or carry out a test at the airport on arrival at a cost of USD 50.00. Regardless of the result, all will be required to stay in a designated government quarantine facility for as long as the local health authorities deem necessary
Entry to Panama is open to Panamanian nationals, residents, tourists and business travelers who have a negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate and who have not spent time in the United Kingdom or South Africa in the 20 days prior to their arrival. The test must be taken no more than 48 hours before you travel. If you cannot do this, a test can be taken at the airport on arrival at a cost of USD 50.00. If the test is positive, there is a mandatory requirement to quarantine for at least 7 days at a government facility
Upon your arrival in Panama, you will be asked to fill out an Affidavit of Health form. This document is available in Spanish and English.

Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.

Normally, foreign driving licences are only valid for 90 days following your entry to the country. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and until further notice, the local transit authorities are issuing rolling extensions each month to the 90-day validity of foreign driving licenses. See Road travel
If you travel to the Darien province you should do so only with an organised group to destinations under the surveillance of the Panamanian police. See Local travel
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Panama, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
