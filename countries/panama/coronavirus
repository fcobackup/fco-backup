Travel in Panama
Panama is currently under a state of emergency, and a curfew is in place.
Measures in place to combat the spread of COVID-19 vary by province. Sanitary cordons may be imposed at short notice to restrict travel between provinces.
Domestic flights are operating.
Nationwide measures
From 19 April, there is a nationwide daily mandated curfew from 12 midnight until 4am. Stricter provincial measures may also apply. Subject to provincial measures, leaving your home/accommodation is permitted between the hours of 4am and 10pm, unless you have any symptoms of COVID-19, or have otherwise been ordered to quarantine by the Panamanian authorities.
If you are arriving internationally during the hours covered by the curfew, you are allowed to travel to your accommodation if you can provide proof of your arrangements or flight details (boarding pass, flight itinerary and/or other forms of proof) to the requesting authorities. ‘Salvoconductos’ (travel permits) are only necessary for those undertaking essential activities that require movement during curfew hours.
Beaches and rivers will be open from 6am until 6pm, from Monday to Sunday. Only family bubbles will be allowed to enter beaches. No big groups will be permitted and alcohol consumption will be prohibited. Social areas and pools in buildings can operate at up to 25% capacity, with limits on numbers to be supervised by each building administration.
Restaurants can continue to operate with the following conditions in place:

They must close at 11pm (Delivery can also continue until 11pm).
All personnel must use facemasks, face shields and comply with biosecurity measures.
Shops must comply with a 50% capacity rule to prevent overcrowding.
