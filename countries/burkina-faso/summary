The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to the following parts of Burkina Faso: all areas of the country north of the town of Boulsa; areas within 40km of the western border with Mali; the W National Park in the south-east bordering Niger and Benin.
The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the rest of Burkina Faso, including the capital Ouagadougou.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Burkina Faso, including kidnaps. You should exercise particular caution around religious holidays, including the Tabaski festival period from 1 to 3 September, 2017. On 13 August 2017, gunmen attacked the Aziz Istanbul restaurant in Ouagadougou. In January 2016, there was a terrorist attack against a hotel and café in central Ouagadougou. Further attacks are possible. See Terrorism
You should take extra care and follow the instructions of the security authorities. There is a risk that terrorist groups may cross the border from Mali and the northern border with Niger into Burkina Faso to carry out kidnap attacks. In January 2016, 2 western nationals were abducted in the northern town of Djibo near the border with Mali, 1 of whom has since been released. There have also been recent attacks on police and military personnel close to the borders with Mali, Niger and Cote d’Ivoire which have been linked to terrorist activity. See Terrorism
