There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Sri Lanka.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Sri Lanka, you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Do not run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating.
Flights
Sri Lankan Airlines have suspended regular flights, but will operate flight UL503 from Colombo to London on 18 April. We do not expect them to operate any further flights until at least 21 April.
Qatar Airways services have been reduced to one flight per day to Doha, with onward connections to the UK. The airline tell us that they intend to keep operating this route for as long as possible. We are unable to say how long that might be.
Airlines operating via the United Arab Emirates, including Emirates Airlines and Etihad, have suspended flights out of Colombo indefinitely. Some airlines are changing flight schedules with little prior notice. You should keep in close contact with your airline or travel agent.
If your airline has cancelled your flight you may need to buy a new ticket with one of the airlines that continue to operate. Your original airline or your insurance provider will be able to confirm arrangements for refunds.
Travelling to the airport
A nationwide curfew is in place. The government has confirmed that airline tickets can be used as a curfew pass to travel to the airport. Your hotel or travel agency should be able to help book transport to the airport. The government has established a helpline for tourists (1912) who are facing problems booking taxis to the airport for departure.
