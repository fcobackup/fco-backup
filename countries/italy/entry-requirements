The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
From 1 January 2021, UK Nationals, resident in Italy by 31 December 2020, will need to show proof of residence when re-entering Italy. This could include an identity card, a registration certificate or a utility bill in your name.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Italy from the UK
With immediate effect and until 15 January, entry into Italy from the UK is only permitted for those with official residency in Italy or those with absolute necessity, which must be declared in writing. You should contact your travel provider for more information. If you are a UK national resident in Italy, we advise carrying proof of your residence when entering Italy.
Until 15 January, all those wishing to fly must present the airline with a negative COVID-19 rapid antigenic or molecular swab test taken no more than 72 hours before travel. You must also take a COVID-19 rapid antigenic or molecular swab test within 48 hours of entering Italy – arrivals by air from the UK will take this test at the airport. Whatever the result of the 2 swab tests, those arriving in Italy from the UK must also report to their local health authorities on arrival and must self-isolate for 14 days.
Everyone arriving in Italy must also call the COVID-19 helpline for the region you are travelling within 48 hours, to inform them of your visit. You can read more about the requirement to get a COVID-19 test (including when you might be exempt) on the Italian Embassy in London guidance on entering Italy.
Measures for all travellers
In addition to the above measures, all travellers to Italy must;
download and complete a self-declaration form from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before travel. You must provide this to your airline/transport provider, or to the border police if you are stopped for checks.
self-isolate on arrival for 14 days if, in the 14 days prior to your arrival in Italy, you have stayed in or transited through a country where Italy continues to require self-isolation. If these conditions apply to you, then you must report promptly to the local health authorities. If you cannot self-isolate for 14 days for any reason, then entry to Italy may be refused.
More information on these requirements is available on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs frequently asked questions page.

Many airlines and airports serving Italy have resumed service, but their schedules may be different to normal and subject to change. You are strongly advised to check your airline’s website, as well as the website for the airport you are intending to fly to for the latest information. You should also expect to be asked to wear a face mask throughout your flight and within the airport terminal.

You should check travel advice for any countries you plan to travel through ahead of your journey.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Italy and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Italian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Italian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Italy with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Italy or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Italian border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Italy.
