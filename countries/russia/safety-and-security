Tell a friend or relative about your travel plans before you go. Give them some idea of your itinerary (if possible), and an emergency contact number.
Check with your mobile phone provider to make sure your phone will work in Russia. Store useful numbers in your phone, such as the British Embassy (+7 495 956 7200) and the local emergency service number (112). To get a local SIM card, you will need to show your passport.
Read our foreign travel checklist for more information and advice on preparing for a safe trip.
Russian regions adjoining Ukraine are likely to be subject to increased security activity by the Russian police and military, such as road blocks and ID checks. Recently there have been a number of incidents in areas close to the border, including major fires in Belgorod on 1 April and at an oil depot in Bryansk on 25 April. You should avoid travelling in regions adjoining the Ukraine/Russia border.
You may be subject to ID checks by the local police . You should keep your passport with you at all times.
Travel from Ukraine
If you have travelled into Russia from Ukraine and are in need of consular assistance, you should contact +7 495 956 7200 or send an enquiry via the web contact form.
Crime
Most visits to Russia have been trouble-free, but petty crime does happen. You should follow the same personal security procedures as you would anywhere else.
Be alert to the possibility of mugging, pick pocketing and theft in the main tourist areas and around the main railway concourses, as well as from vehicles or hotel rooms. Don’t leave your bags unattended. Avoid openly carrying expensive items or anything that might easily identify you as a tourist. Avoid walking about late at night alone. Be wary of groups of women and children who beg. Don’t agree to look after possessions of people you don’t know, and never agree to go to a bar or a club with someone you have just met.
Look after your passport at all times, especially in major transport hubs and busy areas. Passports have been reported stolen or lost from British nationals when in the airports in Moscow. Be particularly vigilant when passing through the airports, particularly in the baggage collection area and outside the arrivals hall.
The spiking of drinks does happen and can lead to robbery, violence and/or abuse. Unconscious victims are often left outside, which can be life threatening in the winter months. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times.
Official looking taxis can be unlicensed, and British nationals travelling in them have been the victims of crime. Taxi apps are a useful way to call a registered taxi. You can also ask your hotel to get a taxi for you or to give you the number of a reputable company. Don’t flag down what may appear to be an official taxi or share a taxi with strangers, as you are putting yourself at risk. Where possible you should agree the fare before getting into the taxi or check that the meter is working.
Foreign visitors are not usually the targets of violent crime. However, in St Petersburg there have been reports of street crime where tourists have been specifically targeted. These crimes are carried out by well organised gangs.
The police do not need a reason in order to stop, question or detain individuals. Bogus police officers have harassed and robbed tourists. If you’re stopped, always insist on seeing identification, and report harassment or crimes to the British Embassy.
Scams
Take care if you are using a dating service. A number of British nationals have been the victims of fraud. Never send money or buy items for anyone you have not met in person.
Be wary of sending money via untraceable transfer services. There have been instances where British nationals have lost money by sending money to an unknown recipient without checking they were genuine.
Political situation
Political rallies and demonstrations occur in cities and towns across Russia, usually with notice and permission from the authorities. Unauthorised demonstrations can lead to a robust response from the Russian authorities, occasionally leading to violence. Under Russian law, actions by one person can be described as a protest. Although no authorization for a single-person protest is required by Russian law,, this still can be subject to repercussions by Russian authorities.
Following President Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, there have been multiple reports of anti-war protests across Russia. There is a heavy police presence to prevent these from taking place.
The following oblasts have declared a state of emergency due to an expected influx of refugees from the Donbas:
Rostov
Voronezh
Kursk
Penza
Volgograd
Saratov
Oryol
Ulyanovsk
Check the local media for the latest information, be vigilant, and avoid any demonstrations.
Race
Most visitors experience no difficulties but racial discrimination may be an issue and might vary according to location. People of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent may attract unwanted attention in public places and should take care, particularly when travelling late at night.
Local travel
Consular support is severely limited in parts of Russia due to the security situation. The North Caucasus remains an unstable and potentially dangerous region. The Russian authorities take a particularly strict attitude towards security, as well as compliance with visa and registration rules. Short-term travel restrictions are sometimes applied in relation to ongoing security operations. These are publicised at very short notice, if at all.
If you travel to these parts of Russia against FCDO advice, you are taking a serious risk. The ability of the FCDO and the British Embassy in Moscow to help in the case of an emergency will be severely limited.
Road travel
See Returning to the UK for information about leaving Russia by road.
The AA and the RAC offer information and advice on driving in Russia, including information on compulsory documentation and equipment. If you’re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.
You will need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit (IDP) to drive in Russia. 1949 IDPs previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted in Russia. You can only get IDPs over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
A green card is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad. You need to carry a green card to drive in Russia.
You should be aware that travel between cities can take a long time given the distance, heavy traffic in big cities, and poor road conditions. Don’t drive alone at night or sleep in your vehicle on the side of the road. Don’t pick up hitchhikers.
Road safety is poor. According to statistics published by the Directorate for Road Traffic Safety there were over 120,000 road traffic accidents in Russia in 2021, causing over 13,000 deaths and over 151,000 injuries. You should be vigilant when driving, take account of weather conditions, and consider limiting or avoiding driving at night.
It is common practice for traffic police to stop motorists for spot checks. There is a zero tolerance policy towards drink driving.
In order to drive a vehicle into Russia, you will need to declare the vehicle with the customs authority at the point of entry. You can bring a vehicle into Russia without paying import taxes for a maximum period of 1 year.
Contact the Russian Embassy if you have more detailed questions about bringing a vehicle into Russia. The British Embassy is unable to offer help to those attempting to bring vehicles into Russia without the correct documentation.
Rail travel
All railway stations have airport-style security. All bags will be scanned and passengers will need to go through detector arches.
If you’re travelling by overnight train in a sleeping compartment, store valuables in the container under the bed or seat. Don’t agree to look after the luggage of a fellow traveller or allow it to be stored in your compartment.
Don’t leave your sleeping compartment unoccupied, as some compartments only have a simple lock on the sliding door. On some trains there may be an additional security device, which can be attached to the fitted handle/lock unit. There may also be a steel switch at head-height on the door panel which, when pulled down, prevents the closed door from being slid open.
Air travel
We are aware that a number of British Nationals (and other nationalities) have been stopped and questioned extensively by security personnel on arrival into Russian airports. In some cases they have been held for 3 - 4 hours whilst further identity checks are made, at which point they have usually been allowed to continue their journeys. In some cases security personnel have asked for access to data on phones and other electronic devices. This could happen regardless of whether you have a visa or residence permit. You are advised to keep a family member, friend or colleague aware of your movements and the fact that getting through the arrival process might take much longer than usual. If you are stopped in this way you should remain calm and avoid any confrontation with security personnel.
See Returning to the UK for information about leaving Russia by air.
The UK Air Safety List (ASL) identifies foreign airlines which do not fulfil the necessary international safety standards, and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the United Kingdom. Its purpose is to help UK travellers to make informed decisions on which air carriers to use when flying overseas. We advise UK nationals travelling overseas to take account of the UK ASL when considering which carriers to fly with. From 8 April 2022, all Russian-certified air carriers are included on the UK ASL. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, published by the UK Civil Aviation Authority. UK travellers seeking alternative air routes or other means of travel, e.g. road or rail, should consult local travel providers.
The volume and quantity of liquids, gels, aerosols, creams or pastes you can carry in your hand luggage when going through airport screening facilities throughout Russia is limited. For more information, refer to the Federal Air Transport Agency (in Russian) or consult your airline.
Disabled access
People with disabilities may face difficulties in accessing certain public areas as disabled facilities vary across Russia, and can be poor or even non-existent in places.
