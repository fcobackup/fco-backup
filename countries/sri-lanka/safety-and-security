Economic situation
Sri Lanka’s economic situation may lead to the limited availability of certain products (for instance medical and food items). Fuel (diesel, petrol), is being rationed. Hospitals and other medical services may also be affected. There may be occasional power cuts to electricity supplies. If you have a health condition, you should speak to your health care provider before travelling to Sri Lanka. Make sure you have adequate supplies of any medicines you need with you.
Fuel rationing is in place. There is now a QR code system in place for fuel purchases. Travellers should ensure transport plans and contingencies are in place ahead of any journeys.
The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) has announced a fuel assistance programme for tourist service providers. More information is available from the SLTDA website.
Occasional power outages could impact services including at shops, cafes, restaurants and hotels. Many venues in popular tourist spots will have backup generators.
Political situation
In 2022, large scale protests resulted in violence, injuries and loss of life. Protests continue to take place from time to time, and security authorities have used tear gas and water cannons against protesters.
Protests, demonstrations, roadblocks and violent unrest may take place anywhere across the island at short notice. Restrictions, including curfews, may be imposed at little or no notice.
You should be vigilant and avoid demonstrations, political protests or large gatherings. Follow the advice of the local authorities, and keep up to date with developments via this travel advice and local media. You should carry your passport as official identification with you at all times.
Crime
There have been increased incidents of low-level opportunistic crime due to the current economic situation.
There have been reports of thefts from hotels and guesthouses and of some street crime targeting tourists (e.g. bags and jewellery being snatched by criminals on mopeds/motorbikes). You should take precautions to safeguard your valuables, especially passports and money.
Violent crimes against foreigners are infrequent. When travelling around Sri Lanka, you should make arrangements through reputable travel companies and take care.
Gun crime is not uncommon, often involving disputes between different criminal groups.
Women travellers
Women continue to report incidents of verbal and physical harassment by men. Harassment - ranging from sexually suggestive or lewd comments to physical advances and sexual assaults - most frequently happens in crowded areas such as market places, railway stations, buses and sporting events, but can happen anywhere. There have been reports of sexual assaults against women in tourist areas. Take particular care when travelling alone or in small groups, and for safety consider carrying a personal alarm.
Drink spiking
There have been reports of drinks being spiked with drugs in bars and restaurants in southern beach resorts. Be careful about taking drinks from strangers at bars and restaurants, and don’t leave drinks unattended.
Scams and fraud
Credit card fraud is a risk for visitors. Use cash wherever possible and only use ATMs attached to banks or major hotels. Don’t lose sight of your credit card.
Air travel
Air accidents are rare, but have happened, including in recent years.
The Sri Lankan Civil Aviation Authority, which regulates the safety of airlines in Sri Lanka, has also published a list of airlines it has certified for cargo and passenger services.
Local travel
North
There is a visible military presence across the North. You should follow local advice and instructions from the security forces and take seriously warning signs about landmines.
Jaffna Peninsula
There is free movement everywhere outside High Security Zones with fewer checkpoints around the Peninsula. Operations to clear mines continue, particularly in the heavily mined area towards Elephant Pass.
Kilinochchi, Mullaittivu, Mannar and Vavuniya
There is a visible military presence. There was severe war damage to property throughout the northern region so accommodation options and infrastructure are limited. There are signs warning of mined areas and you should follow any local advice.
East
Demining and weapons and ordnance clearance operations are ongoing in parts of the East. There are several areas, primarily former military and police locations that continue to be marked as minefields. Always follow the instructions of the local security forces and look out for signs warning of landmines. Don’t leave the roads or cleared footpaths and, if in any doubt, contact the local security authorities for advice.
Swimming
Many beaches in Sri Lanka have dangerous surf or rip tides at certain times of the year. Always take local advice before entering the sea.
Road travel
You will need an International Driving Permit and a Sri Lankan recognition permit to drive in Sri Lanka. You can obtain a recognition permit at the AA in Colombo. A British driving licence on its own will not suffice. Always wear a seatbelt and make sure you are properly insured.
Some roads, particularly in more remote areas, may be in a state of disrepair. Driving is erratic and there are frequent road accidents, particularly at night. Pedestrians and animals often appear in the road without warning. Vehicles may not stop at pedestrian crossings. Riding a motorbike can be particularly dangerous. If you have a collision, stay at the site of the accident with your vehicle as long as it is safe to do so. If it is not safe or if you feel threatened, report to the local police station.
Security checkpoints and roadblocks still occur in parts of the country. Take care when passing through them, and always obey the instructions of the police or army on duty. There have been a few cases where security forces have opened fire on vehicles that have not stopped when asked. Roads around government and military sites in Colombo are regularly closed for security reasons (e.g. VIP convoys).
Public buses are notorious for driving fast and rarely giving way. They are often poorly maintained. A number of serious bus accidents have occurred in recent years. Tourist buses tend to be driven more professionally and safely, but standards can vary.
Taxis are available via local and international taxi apps, particularly in Colombo (coverage can be patchy outside tourist areas). Motorised rickshaws (tuk-tuks) are available for hire in towns and villages. Agree a price before you set off or look for one with a working meter. Most travellers report no difficulties, although there have been reports of harassment, particularly of female travellers in the evening or at night. Change to a different tuk-tuk or taxi if you have any concerns about the driver or standard of driving.
There may be difficulties getting a taxi or tuk-tuk when fuel shortages occur, and there may be limited or no service during curfews.
Rail travel
There have been a number of fatal accidents when visitors have hung out of the open doorways or windows of trains. You should remember that there is a very real risk of death or serious injury if you do not stay within the train carriage while the train is moving. Visitors should also be aware that there are reports of theft of travellers’ personal belongings during train journeys, including theft of briefly unattended belongings, or pick pocketing. Take care of your possessions at all times.
Sea travel
Entry into Sri Lankan waters and security zones in coastal areas requires prior permission.
The threat of piracy related activity and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces remains that all sailing yachts under their own passage should remain out of the designated High Risk Area or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom. For more information and advice, see our Piracy and armed robbery at sea page.
Wildlife
Some wildlife can be dangerous. If in doubt, follow advice from authorised guides or local authorities. Wild elephants and crocodiles will attack humans on occasion. Though not common in populated areas, venomous insects and snakes are found in many parts of the country. Feral dogs are common and sometimes carry rabies.
