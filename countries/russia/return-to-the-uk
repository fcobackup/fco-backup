The British Embassy has been informed of an Aeroflot flight from Moscow to London scheduled for Wednesday 29 April. You can book tickets on the Aeroflot website.
There are otherwise occasional ad-hoc flights to Europe operated by Aeroflot and there have been some charter flights. You should check the Aeroflot and Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport websites for updates.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Help and support
If you still need assistance to get home to the UK, contact the British Embassy Moscow via email at Russia.Coronavirus@fco.gov.uk.
