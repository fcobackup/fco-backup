This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Djibouti set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Djibouti
With effect from 21 June, all passengers arriving in Djibouti who cannot show evidence of having been vaccinated, will have to spend 10 days in quarantine in their own accommodation.
Whether arriving by air, land or sea, if you are over 11 years of age, you will also be required to provide a PCR test certificate from the country where you started your journey. The test must be taken within 72 hours of the start of the journey and 120 hours of arrival in Djibouti.
On arrival at all entry points (land, air or sea), if you are older than 11 years, you will be tested for COVID-19 which can take up to an hour. You should not eat anything 30 minutes before your arrival at the entry point. You will have to pay for the test either by credit card, but as the credit card machines do not always work, cash (dollars, euros accepted) is a more reliable method of payment. If the test result is positive, foreign travellers will have to go into quarantine, at their own expense, at a hotel agreed with those conducting the test or if showing symptoms into the hospital, until testing negative. Djiboutian nationals who test positive can choose to go to a government isolation site at no cost or pay costs of staying at a hotel. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Demonstrating your vaccination status from the UK is not formalised for entry into Djibouti, so you should follow alternative advice for entry. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Exit rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
All travellers must present a negative PCR test when leaving Djibouti. From 21 June, when leaving Djibouti, foreign residents of Djibouti (as well as Djiboutian nationals) are required to show evidence of having received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine or evidence of an appointment overseas for a vaccine or provide evidence of medical exemption from having the vaccine.
