Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bulgaria
The Bulgarian Government has announced that it will be restricting air travel between Bulgaria and the UK from 00:00 on 21 December until 31 January 2021. Airlines have currently cancelled all direct flights to and from the UK, but some indirect flights continue to operate.
A temporary ban on entry has also been imposed at all border crossings into Bulgaria (road, rail, sea, air) on arrivals from the UK, except for Bulgarian citizens and British nationals who are able to demonstrate that they have valid residence status in Bulgaria, as well as members of their families. Additionally, a small number of other categories of travellers, including medical professionals; those travelling for humanitarian purposes; some seasonal workers; some travellers undertaking trade and investment activities; and transport staff engaged in international passenger transport and haulage are exempted from the travel ban.
Further information on the full range of exemptions is available on the following Bulgarian Government web site (in Bulgarian). If you fall into one of the exempted categories, you should contact your travel operator in advance of travel for further information on how to demonstrate your exemption from the travel ban.
Many land borders crossings in the region are restricted or closed for passenger traffic. Furthermore, neighbouring countries are implementing additional health requirements for entry to or departure from Bulgaria including declarations and COVID-19 tests. You should check the relevant FCDO Travel Advice.
If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Interior (English and Bulgarian) before you travel.
Quarantine requirements
From 5pm local time on Sunday 20 December, all those arriving in Bulgaria from the UK, regardless of nationality, are required to self-isolate for 10 days from the date of arrival. The measure is currently scheduled to be in place until 31 January 2021.
A small number of travellers are exempted from the quarantine requirement. These include people transiting through Bulgaria and hauliers and transport crew members who are in transit.
If you’re travelling to Bulgaria from or via another country, you may still be subject to quarantine measures. Check the latest information on the Ministry of Interior website (English and Bulgarian).
Regular entry requirements
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Bulgaria. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Bulgaria guide and contact the Bulgarian Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Visas from 1 January 2021
The rules for travelling or working in Europe will change from 1 January 2021:
you will be able to travel to Bulgaria for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa as a tourist, to visit for family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
as Bulgaria is not within the Schengen area, visits to other EU or Schengen countries will not count towards the 90-day limit
to stay for longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by Bulgaria. This could mean applying for a visa and/or work permit. You should check with the Bulgarian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit, if any, you will need
if you are in Bulgaria with a visa or permit, your stay will not count towards the 90-day limit
The 90-day limit for visa-free travel will begin on 1 January 2021. Any days you stay in Bulgaria before 1 January 2021 will not count towards the 90-day limit.
At border control for Bulgaria, you may need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay, and
use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing
Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
Passport validity
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
Passport validity from 1 January 2021
From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You will need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Bulgaria.
