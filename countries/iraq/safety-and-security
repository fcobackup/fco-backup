Local travel
British government officials serving in Iraq live and work under strict security rules. All British officials live in secure, guarded accommodation and travel with close protection teams at all times. Depending on the threat level, they may be prevented from travelling to certain areas of Iraq.
Hotels and guesthouses used by foreign nationals and the government of Iraq are subject to regular threats. The British embassy doesn’t allow official visitors to stay in a hotel overnight except in the Kurdistan Region, however attendance at meetings in hotels is assessed on case by case basis.
If you travel to areas of Iraq to which the FCO advise against all but essential travel, you should take appropriate security precautions before travelling. Outside of the Kurdistan Region you are strongly advised to employ a private security company, make arrangements for secure accommodation and transport and consider pre-deployment training.
Avoid demonstrations or large gatherings of people; if you become aware of any nearby violence, leave the area immediately.
As part of religious observations, processions and events take place throughout Iraq, especially in Karbala and Najaf. Religious gatherings have previously been targeted by terrorists.
The government of Iraq has begun to take measures to improve the structural integrity of the Mosul Dam as there is a risk the dam could fail. It’s currently impossible to accurately predict if or when this might occur. A failure could lead to major flooding in the Tigris river valley, from Mosul to Baghdad. As there’s likely to be little warning of a failure, it will be logistically impossible for the British Government to evacuate you. The British Embassy has contingency plans to make sure staff are safe in the event of failure. You should make sure you have contingency plans in place and monitor media reporting and this travel advice.
Baghdad
If you’re in in Baghdad, you should have robust contingency plans in place and continue to monitor media reporting. You should stay in close contact with your private security companies and monitor our travel advice pages. Routes in and out of Baghdad may become blocked and airports closed or inaccessible at little or no notice. You should plan and check your routes in advance of travelling.
There remains a threat to western hotels in Baghdad, which could be targeted by terrorist groups. Local Embassies have previously issued travel advice warnings of threats to western hotels in Baghdad. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of the local authorities.
You should avoid political gatherings and large crowds, and minimise your movement around banks, restaurants and shopping malls. Observe instructions given by the local security authorities.
Kurdistan Region
Turkey conducts periodic airstrikes in the far north of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). Take extra care in mountainous areas, particularly near the border with Turkey. Crossing points along the Iraq-Turkey border may also be affected.
The Kurdistan Region is administered by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). The KRG held a referendum on independence from Iraq on 25 September 2017. Tensions in the region remain, including in neighbouring areas such as Kirkuk Province. You should remain alert, monitor media reports and this travel advice.
While the Kurdistan Region has a different security environment to the rest of Iraq, there remains a risk of attacks by Daesh. The security situation in the Kurdistan Region could deteriorate quickly.
On 17 July 2019, a Turkish diplomat and 2 Iraqi Kurds were fatally shot in Huqqabaz Restaurant in Empire City district, Erbil. Kurdish authorities are investigating the incident.
Large numbers of internally displaced people remain in Dohuk province in the Kurdistan Region.
Foreign nationals crossing the border from Syria into the KRI have been arrested for immigration offences in recent months. If prosecuted offenders could face a prison sentence of up to 5 years.
Basra
Protests took place in Basra in August and September 2018, linked to demands for improved services and employment opportunities. Casualties were reported. If protests re-start, you should remain alert, monitor media reports and keep up to date with this travel advice.
Curfews
There are no country-wide curfews at present, but curfews and vehicle bans can be enforced at short notice, particularly around religious holidays, pilgrimages and key political dates like elections.
Land borders
Border crossing points with countries neighbouring Iraq may close with little or no notice. Check whether border crossings will be open before travelling through these areas.
Air travel
Do not leave airports without taking adequate security precautions. You should also take care within all terminal buildings.
Iraqi Airways’ permission to operate to/from points in the EU has been suspended. This is because Iraqi Airways has been unable to satisfy the European Aviation Safety Agency that the airline meets the requirements for non-EU airlines operating to/from the EU. Iraqi Airways operates to several European destinations using aircraft leased [or hired] from other airlines.
Flight schedules may change without notice. Contact your airline or travel company for the latest information before travelling.
Sea travel
Maritime facilities are under a high risk of attack. Maritime and sailing craft should take great care in the northern Persian Gulf. Vessels transiting the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of attack. You should consider any regional tensions that may affect your route.
Road travel
From 28 March 2019, you will need to have a 1968 International Driving Permit to drive in Iraq. 1926 International Driving Permits previously issued by the UK may no longer be accepted for use in Iraq after this date. From 1 February 2019, you can only get International Driving Permits over the counter from 2,500 UK Post Offices. You will not be able to buy an International Driving Permit outside the UK, so get one before you travel.
Road travel within Iraq remains highly dangerous and there continue to be fatal roadside bombings and attacks on military and civilian vehicles. False vehicle checkpoints have been used to launch attacks. There is also a risk of carjacking and robbery.
Road traffic accidents are frequent and often result in fatalities.
Consular assistance
Consular support is severely limited in Iraq. The British Embassy in Baghdad and the British Consulate-General in Erbil operate a limited consular service by appointment only. The Embassy and Consulate-General’s ability to visit locations across Iraq is limited and travel to unsecure areas to deliver consular services may not be possible.
Advice to business
A number of UK companies visit and operate successfully in Iraq. However, movement is restricted and companies nearly always travel with close protection security teams. Specific guidance for companies seeking to do business in Iraq can be found on the Department for International Trade (DIT) website. DIT are also able to put you in touch with companies operating in Iraq who offer security services. For more information see Operating in high-risk environments: Advice for business
