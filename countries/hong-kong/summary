Since June 2019, large-scale political demonstrations have taken place throughout the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), including in areas popular with tourists. While a number of peaceful activities have taken place, many other protests have led to clashes between police and protesters involving significant violence.
The situation around protests and public gatherings can change quickly, with the potential for violence, especially during unauthorised protests. If you’re in an area where demonstrations are taking place, you should remain vigilant, follow the advice of local authorities and move away quickly to a safe place. Previous demonstrations have led to sections of the city being closed off and temporary suspension of public transport without warning. For further safety and security information surrounding protests, see Political situation
