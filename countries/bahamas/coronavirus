Travel in the Bahamas
A public state of emergency is in place until 30 September under the Emergency (COVID-19) Orders, 2020. The measures are available at the Office of the Prime Minister website and are subject to change by the Bahamian government. The situation and rules vary across the islands. Inter-island travel is possible (except to Grand Bahama where a local lockdown has been introduced until 7 August), but subject to change at short notice. Details of the travel health certificate for domestic travel are available from the Bahamian government website.
The emergency measures are as follows:
Face masks must be worn in any public space and must be worn for entry into supermarkets, pharmacies and businesses.
Face masks or coverings must cover your nose and mouth; face mask must also be visible and easily identifiable.
A government issued identification must be carried on person to present at police checkpoints, which have been established on several islands.
A curfew is imposed from 10pm until 5am (and 7pm to 5am on Grand Bahama). Unless they are experiencing a health emergency, tourists are expected to stay in their hotel compound during the curfew.
There are restrictions on the number of persons travelling in a vehicle. Please consult your hotel or tour guide for more details. Family members may travel in the same vehicle without restrictions.
Socially distancing is set at 6ft apart. You may be required to stand or sit in a designated area according to the social distancing measures in place in a particular location.
Hand washing and/or hand sanitizing is required upon entry into public buildings and private establishments. A security guard may ask you to wash your hands or they may spray your hands with a disinfectant.
Some tourist attractions will request your name, identification and telephone number for contact tracing purposes.
Some restaurants only offer outdoor dining, delivery and curbside pick up. You should consult your hotel or tour guide for more detail.
Public gatherings and public movement may be restricted.
Health officers can order persons to be detained for screening and assessment and may order isolation or quarantine on reasonable grounds in order to prevent further spread of the disease. Visitors may incur the cost of quarantine and testing in government designated quarantine facilities.
If you are placed in quarantine or self-isolation, you may be required to download an app to enhance support and monitoring.
Failure to comply with the Emergency (COVID-19) Orders, will result in fines and/or imprisonment. On 28 June, a COVID enforcement unit of the Royal Bahamas Police Force (RBDF) was established to ensure compliance with the Emergency Orders. All Emergency Orders are available on the Office of the Prime Minister’s COVID19 section.
