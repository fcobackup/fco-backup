Following the recent announcement that British Airways will continue flights to and from Gibraltar on a reduced schedule, the Government of Gibraltar (GoG) has issued important new guidance for passengers wishing to use these flights.
Please note that this applies to both those passengers wishing to enter Gibraltar from Spain to return to UK on these flights and also to those wishing to enter Spain from Gibraltar. The guidance can be found in this Government of Gibraltar press release.
See additional advice on making travel plans to return to the UK, or what to do if you cannot depart immediately.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
