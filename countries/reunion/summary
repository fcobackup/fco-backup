The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Réunion based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
Entry to Réunion is restricted at present. For further information, see the local Prefecture website for essential reasons.
Travellers have to provide the completed necessary “attestation” which is available from the local Prefecture website.
Travellers have to produce a negative result of a PCR test carried out less than 72 hours before departure. Arrivals to Réunion will be required to self-isolate for seven days, before taking another PCR test. Travellers may need to produce a self-certified document affirming that they have no COVID symptoms and that to their knowledge they have not been in contact with any person confirmed positive within the last 14 days.
These entry requirements are subject to change. For further information on the entry restrictions in place for French Overseas Territories, see the French government’s website before travelling.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

Réunion is a French Overseas Territory. There is no formal British diplomatic representation on the island. If you need consular assistance you should contact the British Embassy in Paris.
The cyclone season normally runs from December to April. You should monitor the progress of approaching storms and follow the advice of the local authorities. See Natural disasters
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Réunion, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
Most visits to Réunion are trouble-free. Crime levels are low, but you should take sensible precautions.
