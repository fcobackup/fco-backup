There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Croatia. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Croatia you are strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the FCO’s contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. Where departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Flights
Regional airports are currently closed until further notice. Zagreb International Airport remains open but on a restricted schedule. You should check the status of your flight with your airline as airport operations may be subject to change at short notice.
Lufthansa are currently operating a daily service from Zagreb to London Heathrow via Frankfurt Airport.
Travelling to Zagreb International Airport
Restrictions remain in place for travel between cities and counties within Croatia. If you are travelling to Zagreb from the coast, or further afield, for the purpose of catching a flight you will need to carry a copy of your flight reservation with you and be prepared to share it with authorities along your route.
Road
It remains possible to drive to the UK by road. If you wish to return by road, you should ensure that you have checked the travel advice for all of the countries along your chosen route as transit restrictions and documentary requirements may vary. In addition, we recommend that you carry proof of your residential UK address as well as a copy of your ferry or Eurotunnel reservation with you.
