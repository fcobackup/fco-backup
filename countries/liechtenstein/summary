The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Liechtenstein based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
Due to COVID-19 restrictions, UK nationals and other non-Liechtenstein / EU / EFTA citizens arriving from the UK or a ‘high risk country’ are not permitted entry to Liechtenstein. However, exemptions do apply.
UK nationals who hold a residence or cross-border permit for Liechtenstein or Switzerland, or who are travelling from other Schengen countries, can enter Liechtenstein.
Travellers need to present a negative COVID-19 test result (PCR), carried out less than 72 hours before arrival. Children aged 12 or under are exempt from this requirement.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
Liechtenstein is on the amber list for entering England. Check what you must do to enter England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
