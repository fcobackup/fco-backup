This page has information on travelling to Malaysia.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Malaysia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Malaysia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
Further information on entry requirements for Malaysia is available from the Malaysian authorities. On 30 December 2022 the Malaysian government re-imposed limited COVID-19 checks on entry to the country. The Ministry of Health stated that all travellers must undergo temperature screening upon arrival to Malaysia. Those with a fever, who are otherwise symptomatic, or who have travelled to China within the last 14 days must take a Covid-19 RTK test at the airport before entry to the country. Those testing positive will be required to isolate at home or, in moderate to severe cases, may be referred to a local health facility.
Entry requirements for Sabah
Effective from 8 January, all travellers from China must be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 according to the criteria set by their respective home countries before entering Sabah. They must also present a negative Covid-19 RTK test result, taken at least 48 hours before departure, before entry to Sabah.
All other travellers must undergo temperature screening upon entry to Sabah. Those with a fever or who are otherwise symptomatic must take a Covid-19 RTK test at the airport before entry to the State. Those testing positive will be required to isolate at home or, in moderate to severe cases, may be referred to a local health facility.
If you are fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. See entry requirements for Sabah above. See ‘All Travellers’
Proof of vaccination status
You do not need to provide proof of your vaccination status for entry to Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak. See entry requirements for Sabah above.
If you are not fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. See entry requirements for Sabah above.
If you are transiting through Malaysia
You can transit (up to 24 hours only) via Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) as long as you remain airside.
If transiting between the two Kuala Lumpur terminals - KLIA and KLIA2 be aware these are separate airports and will require you to go through immigration.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
If you are visiting Malaysia, your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date you arrive. If it is not, you may be refused entry and detained. You may also be refused entry and detained if your passport has any damage or has pages missing.
Visas
British nationals do not need a visa to visit Malaysia. You will normally be given permission to stay for 90 days on arrival. Visas for longer stays or for non-tourist purposes must be obtained from the nearest Malaysian diplomatic mission before you travel.
The Malaysian authorities are running a vigorous campaign against illegal immigration. Do not overstay your visa, or violate the terms of entry. Even if you overstay for just a few days, you can be fined, detained, deported to the UK and blacklisted. Flight costs will be the responsibility of the individual. Conditions in prisons and immigration detention facilities can be poor with limited healthcare services.
Please note the British High Commission is unable to provide any assistance for you to remain in Malaysia, including issuing any document to support your overstay.
If you’re travelling between Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (sometimes known as Malaysian Borneo and comprising the states of Sabah and Sarawak) you will need to carry your passport. You must get an entry stamp in East Malaysia at your initial port of entry.
You should make and keep safe a copy of your passport and visa in case your passport is lost. It may take time to obtain a replacement visa. If you cannot present your original valid visa on exit you may be treated as an overstayer, fined and blacklisted.
Drug screening on Arrival
You could be asked to take a urine test on arrival in Malaysia if you are suspected of having used drugs before your visit. This includes if you are travelling from a country where possession and use of drugs such as cannabis is legal. There are severe penalties for all drug offences in Malaysia, including possession of illegal drugs and the presence of drugs in your blood stream. See Local laws and customs
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Dual nationals
Malaysia doesn’t recognise dual nationality. You can be refused entry if you’re found to be holding a Malaysian passport and one of a different nationality. For those people with dual nationality (not including Malaysian), we advise entering and exiting with the same passport.
Customs and Exchange control rules
Check the website of the Malaysian Customs Service for information on restricted or prohibited items that may not be brought into the country. If you are in any doubt about the legality of any items - including medications - you should declare them on entry.
You can import or export up to the equivalent of US $10,000 in Malaysian Ringgit without prior approval. There are no limits on the amount of foreign currency you can import or export, but you must declare any amount in excess of US$ 10,000. Penalties include a fine of up to RM 1 million and up to 3 years’ imprisonment. Further information can be found on the Royal Malaysian Customs Department website.
