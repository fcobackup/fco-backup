The Croatian authorities have put in place a series of measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
On 19 March the Croatian government announced that it would join other European Union member states in closing its land borders for a period of 30 days. The government has also advised that foreign nationals who do not have a valid residence permit are not allowed to enter Croatia. Croatians and their family members are allowed to return to the country. Exemptions are in place to permit the travel of healthcare professionals, EU (and UK nationals until December 2020) returning to their place of residence, goods carriers, cross border workers, diplomatic and military personnel, and passengers in transit. Further information about these restrictions can be found on the Croatian government website
A compulsory 14 day period of self-isolation remains in place for those entering Croatia from a number of European destinations, including the United Kingdom. Restrictions on travel may change at any time. You are advised to check the latest regulations before travelling.
British travellers currently in Croatia are allowed to leave. If you have questions regarding your onward travel arrangements, please contact your travel provider. Those refusing self-isolation will be denied entry into Croatia and be instructed to return to their point of origin. The Croatian Government has warned that failure to comply with public health decisions may result in fines or criminal charges being brought.
The Croatian Government Office for Public Health is publishing updates and advice (in Croatian, with some information in English).
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
