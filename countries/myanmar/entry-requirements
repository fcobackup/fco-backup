The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Myanmar
The Government of Myanmar has suspended all international commercial passenger flights from any of its airports until 31 July. It will then review the situation.
New tourist visa applications are currently suspended until 31 July.
At present Myanmar authorities can offer business visas to foreign nationals with a compelling case. You or your employer must make your case to your nearest Myanmar Embassy and obtain permission.
These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice.
Testing/Screening on arrival
There are temperature checks for all arrivals. Arrivals must provide a “COVID-FREE” certificate issued no more than 72 hours before boarding a flight to Myanmar.
Quarantine Requirements
Arrivals in Myanmar must enter government-arranged quarantine. You will be allotted your quarantine facility on arrival. You will have no choice but will be placed in the same government quarantine facility or hotel as all the other people on your flight. You will be provided with food, for which you will be charged.
All business visa arrivals will need to:
Show evidence of having completed 7 days quarantine prior to the date of travel. This can be verified by an employer’s or doctor’s declaration, or a self-declaration. You may only leave your place of quarantine in the final 72 hours preceding travel to take a COVID test.
Provide a “COVID-FREE” certificate issued no more than 72 hours before boarding a flight to Myanmar.
Complete 7 days quarantine in a government facility or government approved hotel (allocated on arrival).
Undertake a COVID test. If negative you can complete 7 days of self-isolation at home or at a verifiable address. If you test positive, you will be transferred to a designated government hospital for Covid patients. You will be required to remain for 28 days in hospital, after which you can leave if you have tested negative for Covid for two consecutive weeks prior.
Complete a further COVID test conducted by the National Health Laboratory during the second week of quarantine. The cost is MMK 200,000.
If hospitalised with coronavirus, patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are generally expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to purchase food or make phone calls.
These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice.
