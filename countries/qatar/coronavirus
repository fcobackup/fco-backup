Entry and borders
From the evening of 16 March until further notice, no international passengers – including those with a residence permit - will be allowed to enter Qatar. Transit passengers travelling on to another destination will still be able to transfer through Qatar, and some flights continue to operate. You should check with your airline or travel company for the latest information if you are planning to leave Qatar. Flights are subject to change or cancellation at short notice.
You should contact your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider for information on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry restrictions, or have queries around the extension of visas, contact the local immigration authorities. You can find further information on visa requirements and extensions on the Qatar Ministry of Interior website.
As airports in the UK remain operational, British nationals currently in Qatar on on-arrival visas can only extend their visa twice, by 30 days on each occasion. Overstaying this 90 day period will result in overstay fines. The second extension (ie after 60 days) needs to be done either in person at the airport immigration building (near the cargo area), or by email, attaching an image of the passport biodata, entry stamp and sticker to visasection@moi.gov.qa
Qatar’s Ministry of Public Health has published advice on how to limit the spread of coronavirus and have introduced a number of precautionary restrictions on travel and events in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Local measures
Public transport - including the metro and bus services - has been suspended around the country. Qatar has prohibited all social gatherings, postponed sporting and public events, and closed all public venues and shops, apart from supermarkets, garages and pharmacies. Restaurants and cafes are either closed or are only allowed to make deliveries. The authorities are deploying mobile patrols and setting up checkpoints to prevent social gatherings and anyone violating this may be detained and prosecuted. The authorities may also stop vehicles with more than one occupant to enquire about the reason for the journey.
