This page has information on travelling to Fiji.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Fiji set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Fiji’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
COVID-19 entry restrictions
Fiji’s borders have fully re-opened.
Fiji’s borders are fully open to all travellers as of 14 February 2023.
All travellers
All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Fiji before travel.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of entry into Fiji.
Visas
Visas are not needed for visits of up to 4 months. You must have an onward or return ticket and a valid visa for the next country you’re travelling to. If you’re visiting Fiji on business you will be granted a Business Visitos Permit for a period of 21 days.
If you plan to stay for longer than 4 months, you will need to apply for a visa from the Fiji High Commission in London.
Yachts can only enter Fiji through Suva, Lautoka, Savusavu and Levuka. For other ports, such as Nadi/Denarau, prior arrangement with the Fijian Authorities is needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are valid for entry, airside transit and exit from Fiji.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Customs requirements
Fiji customs enforce strict quarantine regulations and x-ray all in-bound luggage at Nadi airport. Most perishable foodstuffs will be confiscated on arrival, unless arriving from a country with quarantine agreements with Fiji.
You must declare currency amounts in excess of FJ$10,000.
Travelling with children
Some countries need documentary evidence of parental responsibility before allowing lone parents to enter the country or, in some cases, before permitting the children to leave the country.
In the case of Fiji, no such documentation is needed for visitors. But it is needed for those applying for work and/or residency permits. For further information contact the Fiji High Commission in London.
