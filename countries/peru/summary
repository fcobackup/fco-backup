On 14 December, the Peruvian Government announced a 30 day nationwide State of Emergency in response to ongoing protests following a change of government on 7 December. The political situation is volatile. Protests are unpredictable and can escalate quickly and include violence. They continue to take place in different parts of the country, including Lima, Apurimac, Ayacucho, Arequipa, Cusco, Puno, Ica, and along parts of the Pan-American Highway.
British nationals should take particular care to avoid all areas of protests. If possible, you should remain in a safe place. You should also monitor local media, including social media channels.
Travellers arriving in Lima should be aware that travel to some parts of the country may not be possible. Protests continue to cause travel disruption, with road blockades and regional airport closures, including Ayacucho airport. Cusco, Juliaca (Puno) and Arequipa airports have reopened, however commercial flight operations across the country continue to be disrupted and/or limited in some instances. Lima airport is restricting entry to passengers only with valid flight tickets. Travellers should recheck with their airline or tour operator and revisit travel plans ahead of any travel. For information on Lima airport operations, please visit the Lima airport website.
Protests also resulted in the suspension of train services to/from Machu Picchu. A service from Machu Picchu has begun to resume a partial service, with travel possible some of the way before the service connects with vehicles for onward travel to Cusco.
Any British Nationals experiencing travel problems should consider completing the Peruvian tourist authority i-Peru’s online form, which is being used to inform the work of Peruvian authorities in assisting people.
