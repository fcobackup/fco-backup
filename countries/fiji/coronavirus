Travel in Fiji
Following identification of a COVID-19 case outside quarantine, Fiji has entered a 14 day restriction period from 19 April. Travel between the West (Nadi, Lautoka and surrounding areas) and other parts of Viti Levu is very limited. Religious services, sporting events and non-work gatherings are suspended. Schools are closed for three weeks. Many businesses continue to operate but require customers to display their careFiji app or register their details for contact tracing purpose. High-risk businesses such as gyms, cafes, bars, and amusement arcades will be closed for the 14 day period. Domestic passenger flights and boat services to and from Viti Levu are suspended from 22 April. International flights are suspended until further notice for all passenger air travel into and out of Fiji for non-medical purposes. The Fijian government is encouraging people to work from home, and to leave their houses only if essential.
A nationwide curfew is in effect from 11pm to 4am each night. Gatherings are no longer restricted to a hard limit of 100 persons, but venues are required to limit capacity by half. This applies to weddings, funerals, conferences, community gatherings, cafes and restaurants. Fiji’s authorities are encouraging social distancing, good hand hygiene and are urging those who have cold/flu symptoms to stay at home. Fiji government is also encouraging residents to download the careFiji contact tracing app. In some instances, such as at the airport, you will need to show you have this on your phone. Full details on the government’s response can be found on the Ministry of Health and Medical services website
If you’re looking to leave Fiji and are visiting the outer islands, you’re advised to return to the main island of Viti Levu immediately. Further cases of COVID-19 in Fiji could see the reintroduction of restrictions on internal travel and/or a lockdown of affected areas. More information on the latest restrictions are available on the Fiji government website.

Some hotels and rental accommodation are open, and social distancing measures are in place.
Public places and services
Public places are open including shops, restaurants, places of worship, cinemas and swimming pools. Nightclubs remain closed and you must abide by the nationwide curfew which need you to remain in your home or accommodation between 11pm and 4am.
Healthcare in Fiji
If you begin to feel unwell self-isolate by staying at home, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, for example, to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.
If you develop symptoms of COVID-19 including fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services have a hotline (telephone number 158) to provide help. They will be able to direct you to the right health facility.
