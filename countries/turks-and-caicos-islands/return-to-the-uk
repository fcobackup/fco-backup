There are currently no commercial ferries or flights departing from Turks and Caicos, however some charter services remain in operation. Provo Air Center is currently taking expressions of interest from UK, EU, US, and Canadian citizens currently in Providenciales who would like to return home via shared charter flights.
Those interested in potential flights, either directly to the UK, or to connect with commercial flights from the USA or elsewhere, should send contact information, preferred destination and details of your party to debby@provoaircenter.com. Other charter operators may also offer similar services.
Please check the travel advice and border regulations for any country that you plan to transit through on the way back to the UK before departing Turks and Caicos.
What to do
If you cannot leave Turks and Caicos at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus. Latest information is available on the Turks and Caicos Government website
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well
See more information and advice about staying where you are if you cannot return to the UK.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Your journey home
