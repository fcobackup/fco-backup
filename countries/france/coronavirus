Borders and entry
On 16 March, the French Government announced that the EU would suspend travel between the EU and non-European countries for an initial period of 30 days from midday 17 March. The French Government confirmed that these restrictions will not apply to UK nationals.
The French authorities have also confirmed there are now border checks in place with Italy, Spain and Germany.
UK nationals can enter France if they have completed the necessary “attestation” confirming that their travel is an absolutely necessary journey.
There is separate guidance for the freight transport industry published jointly by the Department for Transport and the FCO.
Some countries are imposing a compulsory period of quarantine for all travellers from France. If you are travelling from or through France, check the situation at your destination before you travel.
Local measures
Travel should be limited to journeys that are absolutely necessary, effective from midday 17 March for an initial period of 15 days. Necessary journeys include:
*to purchase food * to seek medical care * urgent family reasons including childcare or assisting vulnerable people * journeys to work where working from home is not possible * to exercise.
Anyone making such a journey will need to download and complete an “attestation” or declaration certifying their reason for travel. You can hand write and sign a similar declaration if you are unable to access printing facilities. You must carry a physical copy of the declaration; electronic versions will not be accepted.
The French Government has said it will enforce these measures and fine those who are not compliant. For more information, read the guidance (in French) issued by the French Government on the French Government and French Ministry of the Interior websites. You should follow instructions of the French authorities.
These measures are in addition to those already announced, including the closure of all non-essential establishments open to the public (i.e. restaurants, cafes, cinemas) from midnight on 14 March until further notice. Food shops, pharmacies, petrol stations, and banks will stay open. On 15 March, the French Government also announced that public transport will be progressively reduced over the course of the next week.
Ski resorts
On 15 March, the National Union for Ski Regions and the National Association for Mayors in Regions with Ski Resorts announced that all ski resorts in France are closed with immediate effect until further notice. Consult your relevant tour, travel operator and insurance provider as to your immediate next steps.
Further information
You should monitor the French government website (in French) to inform your decisions regarding travel to, from or within France.
