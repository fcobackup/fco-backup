The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Uruguay, due to travel restrictions implemented by the Uruguayan Government related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. See Health.
The FCO strongly encourage non-resident British nationals in Uruguay to consider leaving as soon as possible to avoid difficulties they will face if flights out of the country and the region are further restricted and they are unable to get home.
The Uruguayan government announced that it would ban all flights from Europe from Friday 20 March at 00:00, for an undefined period. The border with Argentina, including river crossings, is closed until further notice. The Buquebus ferry service has limited crossings available for those that need to return to, and can demonstrate, their country of residence.
The Uruguayan Ministry of Health requires that all passengers who arrived from China, South Korea, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Iran, France and Germany, and those who have had contact with a COVID-19 infected person, self-isolate for a period of 14 days. See Health

You will need to check the Travel Advice for any country you will be transiting or visiting after or before Uruguay as there may be other restrictions in place. Further information is also available from the Uruguayan Ministry of Health (in Spanish). Please ensure that you are able to comply with the quarantine requirements before you travel.
