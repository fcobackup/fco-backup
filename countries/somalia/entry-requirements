The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
A visa is required for all travel to Somalia, including Somaliland. If you arrive at Mogadishu International Airport, you can get a single entry visa, valid for one month, for US$60 in cash. You may also be required to provide a letter of invitation on arrival in Somalia outlining the purpose of your travel. This letter can usually be obtained from your place of work (a hotel booking may also suffice). Without this letter, you could be denied entry.
British nationals are also able to obtain a single entry visa, valid for one month, on arrival in Somaliland for US$60 in cash.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from your date of entry into Somalia, including Somaliland.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK emergency travel documents are valid for entry and exit to/from Somalia, including Somaliland.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Dual Nationality
Please note that the Government of Somalia and the authorities in Somaliland will consider anyone of Somali or Somaliland descent to hold dual-British and Somali or Somaliland nationality. The British Government is limited in the consular support it can offer in such circumstances.
