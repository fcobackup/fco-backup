The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
You will need a visa to travel to Nepal.
To apply for a visa in the United Kingdom you should contact the Embassy of Nepal, 12A, Kensington Palace Gardens, London, W8 4QU (telephone: +20 7229 1594 or 6231 or 5352).
Visas are available on arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport and at some land borders. To obtain a visa upon arrival by air in Nepal you must fill in an application form on arrival and provide a passport photograph. A single-entry visa valid for 15, 30 or 90 days costs US$25, 40 or 100. At Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan Airport the fee is payable in any major currency (some land crossings insist on payment in US dollars), Children under 10 require a visa but are not charged a visa fee. A Nepali visa is valid for entry for three to six months from the date of issue.
If you wish to stay for more than 60 days you can extend your visa up to 30 days by applying to the Nepali Department of Immigration at Kalikasthan, Kathmandu (telephone: +977 1 4429659).
Multiple-entry visas are useful if you are planning travel to Tibet, Bhutan or India. You can change your single-entry visa to a multiple-entry visa at Kathmandu’s Central Immigration Office for US$20.
You must have a valid visa in your passport to leave Nepal. If your visa has expired you will have to arrange an extension at the Department of Immigration, before your departure.
Overstaying without authority is serious. Foreign nationals who overstay in Nepal without a valid visa are subject to (i) a fine of up to 50,000 Nepali Rupees, and/or (ii) deportation from Nepal. Approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs is required for deportation, which could be a lengthy process. The immigration office may take the foreign national in its custody (detain) until the decision is made by the Ministry of Home Affairs. For more information, please contact Nepal Immigration.

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months when you submit your application for a visa.
