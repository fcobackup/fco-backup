Local laws reflect the fact that Yemen is an Islamic country. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas.  
In 2020, the holy month of Ramadan is expected to start on 23 April and finish on 23 May. See Travelling during Ramadan
Don’t drink alcohol in public. You should dress modestly. Take care when using cameras anywhere near military or religious sites. Don’t take pictures of people without their consent.
You must get permission from the General Authority for Antiquities before exporting or removing antiques from Yemen. Illegal movement or sale of Yemeni antiques is a serious offence under local law which can carry a custodial sentence.
