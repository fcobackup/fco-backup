The level of tension and the security situation on the Korean Peninsula can change with little notice. Tensions, which may affect Japan, can rise following missile tests by North Korea and during the regular South Korean-US military exercises, which take place throughout the year.
The Japanese government have confirmed the launch of three missiles from DPRK towards Japan in the morning of 3 November. All three are believed to have landed in the Sea Of Japan.  Alerts were issued in Miyagi, Niigata and Yamagata prefectures, but the Government of Japan confirmed later than none passed over Japan and there are no reports of any damage.  DPRK has launched numerous missiles towards Japan in 2022 and we expect this pattern to continue.  Please follow instructions by the local authorities and check NHK World for the latest information.
You should keep in touch with news broadcasts, follow the advice of the local authorities (Cabinet Secretariat Civil Protection Portal Site) and keep up to date with this travel advice.
