Forest fires
Forest fires are a risk during the extended summer months. Forest fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable; check with local authorities if you’re considering travelling to affected areas. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas and report fires to the emergency services. For information on what to do in the event of a forest fire you can visit the website of the Civil Protection Department.
Flooding
High waters known as “acqua alta” are a common occurrence in Venice during the winter months and can cause flooding in parts of the city.
Heavy rain falls are common throughout Italy during the winter months which can cause local flooding. You should monitor local media and weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities in affected areas.
Earthquakes
Many parts of Italy lie on a major seismic fault line. Minor tremors and earthquakes are a regular occurrence. To learn more about what to do before, during, and after an earthquake visit the Protezione Civile website.
