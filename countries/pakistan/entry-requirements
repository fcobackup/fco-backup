This page has information on travelling to Pakistan.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Pakistan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Pakistan’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
You will need a visa to enter or travel through Pakistan as a visitor. For further information consult the High Commission for Pakistan in London.
Passengers no longer require evidence of full vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative PCR test in order to undertake inbound flights to Pakistan.
If you’re transiting through Pakistan
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Land Borders
The FCDO advise against travel to most of the Afghanistan and Iran border areas. The majority of Pakistan’s land borders are open.
The Torkham border crossing with Afghanistan is open to those crossing with valid passports and Pakistan visas, which you can apply for on the Ministry of Interior website. All borders with Afghanistan are liable to close at short notice and there have previously been reports of crowding and violence at open crossings. Those crossing into Pakistan may have to comply with coronavirus testing and quarantine measures. The FCDO currently advises against all travel to Afghanistan and Iran.
Illegal entry to Pakistan is a serious offence. If you cross from Afghanistan without the correct documentation you may be subject to detention and/or deportation. There is currently no process for regularisation of status for illegal entrants, which is necessary for onward travel.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport Validity
If you are visiting Pakistan, your passport should be valid for 6 months from the date of your visa application.
Check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
If you’re travelling to Pakistan on a British passport, you will need to get a visa before you travel. Visa violations can be treated as a criminal offence and could result in a fine or detention.
Journalists’ visas often have additional travel restrictions, which you should observe.
For further information consult the High Commission for Pakistan in London, including for information on any changes in visa process during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP)
You can enter Pakistan visa free and remain there for an unlimited period of stay if you hold a valid National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP) or Smart National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (SNICOP). For more information visit the website of the High Commission for Pakistan in London.
Travelling with children
A single parent or other adult who is not the child’s parent may need to provide documentary evidence of parental responsibility, particularly if the child is of Pakistani origin, before the immigration authorities will allow the child to leave the country.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Returning to the UK
All passengers leaving Pakistan must have a valid visa, a Pakistani national identity card or a valid Pakistani passport. If you are travelling on a British passport and your visa has expired you may not be allowed to board your flight unless you have a visa extension or an exit visa. Contact the Ministry of Interior, or refer to the website of the Directorate General of Immigration and Passports for instructions on visa extensions and exit visas.
If you’re visiting Pakistan for more than 4 weeks, you may need to provide proof of polio vaccination when you leave Pakistan. For more information, see the website of the National Travel Health Network and Centre.
Screening on departure
If you are leaving Pakistan, you may be screened at the airport for any symptoms of COVID-19. You may also be subject to thermal screening for high temperatures. If you are vaccinated and free from symptoms you will be allowed to travel. If you’re suspected of having symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough and breathing difficulty, you will be subject to a secondary screening by a medical professional or undergo rapid antigen testing. After which, you may be allowed to board if it is assessed that you do not have symptoms, have not been at risk of exposure and do not have a fever. If the secondary screening assesses that you may have COVID-19 you may be asked to self-isolate 5 days before you can travel. You may also be referred to a medical facility.
