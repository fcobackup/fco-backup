These restrictions may not apply if you have an internal travel permit (salvo-conducto) from the Peruvian authorities. These are only issued to those who are travelling from or via regions still under lockdown and only for repatriation purposes (for those with confirmed bookings to leave Peru).
If this applies to you, contact the British Embassy who will make a request to the Peruvian authorities. Depending on your destination region, you may have to spend some time (possibly two weeks) in quarantine immediately after arrival. The exact location of the quarantine will be decided by the regional government upon arrival.
You should note before being able to move from one region of Peru to another, the local government may first require you to submit a medical certificate, following a COVID-19 test, stating that you are free from infection.
Relaxing of restrictions
The Peruvian government has approved a four-phase Economic Reactivation Plan, between May and August which involves relaxing some restrictions and reopening some industry sectors such as Industry and Mining, Construction, Trade and Tourism and Services. For Tourism and Services, the plan involves reopening or restarting the following:
first phase (May): Restaurants (via delivery), hotels and storage
second phase (June): Inter-provincial transport and flights, restaurants (restricted service); some malls and commercial centres have re-opened
third phase (July): International flights, restaurants and hotels operating normally
fourth phase (August): Leisure activities, conventions, meetings, gatherings
This planned relaxation of industry restrictions remains under review and continues to change. The government has not yet set a date for the re-start of commercial international travel. Commercial internal travel is only permitted in regions that are not under lockdown.
