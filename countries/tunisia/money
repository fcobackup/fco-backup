ATMs are widely available. Almost all ATMs will accept Visa cards, and many (including Bank of Tunisia and BIAT) will also accept Maestro cards for cash withdrawals.
UK issued credit and debit cards are accepted in an increasing number of shops, restaurants and hotels, though there can be connectivity problems. In places that do take cards, there can be problems authorising Mastercard purchases. Travellers Cheques are accepted in some hotels but not others.
It is strictly prohibited to take Tunisian dinars out of the country. To exchange any Tunisian dinars left over at the end of your stay into Sterling or other hard currency you will need to show the receipt from the bank where you first withdrew or bought the dinars. Please note that receipts from cash machines are not accepted.
