Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Call 15 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.
Health risks and recommended vaccines
Check TravelHealthPro’s current advice on Senegal to find out how to reduce the health risks you’ll face there, including:
dengue
Zika virus
yellow fever
TravelHealthPro also lists the recommended vaccines that could apply to you. At least 8 weeks before you travel, check how to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the NHS travel vaccinations page.
Medication
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
You’ll find pharmacies which accept UK prescriptions in major cities. The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in Senegal
Medical facilities in Dakar are reasonable, but are limited in the rest of Senegal. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
