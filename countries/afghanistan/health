Other health risks
Diarrhoeal diseases and other gastrointestinal infections are common causes of ill health, becoming worse in the hotter months.  
The dry dusty conditions in summer and winter can cause irritation to the eyes, throat, nose and skin.
Respiratory tuberculosis is common in the Afghan population. 
Malaria is present except in the high mountainous regions of the country and in winter. 
Local medical care
We advise against all travel to Afghanistan and advise all British nationals to leave now. Only very limited medical facilities are available in Afghanistan and access is likely reduced in the deteriorating security situation.
If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 112 or 020 112 from mobile (in Kabul only) and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company promptly if youâ€™re referred to a medical facility for treatment. Ambulance services may request payment or evidence of insurance before providing assistance.
