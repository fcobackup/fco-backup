Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Djibouti. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Djibouti and international interests within Djibouti (including several military bases and personnel) may be seen as a legitimate target by Al Shabaab because of Djiboutian participation in the African Union peacekeeping mission, AMISOM, and international support to the Somali Government. Al Shabaab has previously issued public threats against Djibouti. In May 2014, they claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at a restaurant in Djibouti city, which injured foreign nationals.
Be vigilant at all times, especially in crowded areas and public places like transport hubs, hotels, restaurants, shopping areas and bars, and during major gatherings like sporting or religious events. Previous terrorist attacks in the region have targeted places where football matches were being viewed.
Follow the advice of local authorities, take care while travelling around the country and avoid large gatherings.
There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time.
