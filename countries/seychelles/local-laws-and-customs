Drug taking and smuggling are serious offences in Seychelles.
Topless sunbathing is uncommon and not tolerated on some beaches. Nudism is not acceptable.
Homosexuality is not illegal in Seychelles. However, local attitudes vary, so public displays of affection may be best avoided or at least discreet. Same-sex marriage is not currently permitted by law. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
