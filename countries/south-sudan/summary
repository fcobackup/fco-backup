The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to South Sudan. If you choose to travel to South Sudan against FCO advice, you should ensure that you exercise caution and vigilance at all times, have robust contingency plans in place, and avoid any travel during the hours of darkness.
Levels of intercommunal violence remain high across the country, and there are sporadic reports of fighting between armed groups in certain areas. It is possible that such violence will increase in the run-up to, and beyond, the late February deadline for the formation of a new Transitional Government of National Unity.
There are also regular reports of serious criminality in Juba, particularly during the hours of darkness. There’s no official government curfew in Juba, but the British Embassy and most international organisations observe a self-imposed curfew, the timing of which changes in response to the situation.
Juba Airport is open and commercial flights are operating, but you should check flight schedules with airlines before travelling to the airport. Timings are subject to change at short notice. You should make sure you have a valid visa before travelling.
Consular support is severely limited in South Sudan. The British Embassy in Juba does not have a consular section. If you are in South Sudan and need urgent help from the UK Government, contact the British High Commission in Nairobi.
If you choose to travel, you should monitor this travel advice, subscribe to email alerts for updates, and follow us on Facebook and Twitter.
You should be vigilant of the local security situation, monitor the local media, and stay in a safe location. Most international organisations in South Sudan employ a security manager to monitor the situation and keep employees safe.
You should make sure you have comprehensive contingency plans that don’t rely on support from the Embassy, including a stock of essential supplies and up-to-date travel documents and visas. If you’re concerned about your safety, you should contact the FCO on +44 207 008 1500.
A ceasefire is currently in place, and has largely held since September 2018. But a deterioration in the security situation remains possible, and could be prompted by a number of factors including developments in the fragile economy and the ongoing peace process. As it currently stands, a transitional government is scheduled to form in February 2020. In the event of a serious deterioration, similar to those of July 2016 and December 2013, routes into and out of South Sudan may be blocked, Juba airport may be closed or inaccessible, and flights may be suspended at short notice. Regional developments may also increase the unpredictability of infrastructure and transport, as happened in April 2019 when events in Sudan led to the temporary closure of South Sudan’s airspace. The main road connecting Juba to Uganda is extremely dangerous, with regular reports of accidents and attacks on vehicles by armed groups.
Terrorist attacks in South Sudan can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
