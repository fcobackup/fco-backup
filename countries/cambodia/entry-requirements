The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
Suspension of tourist visas, e-visas, visa on arrival and visa exemptions came in to effect on 31 March.
The latest information on visas from the relevant authorities is as below:
Tourist Visa: For all short term visitors arriving on or after 01 January 2020, tourist visas will be automatically extended and any overstay fines will be waived. The policy was introduced in early April in order not to penalise visitors who have not been able to leave Cambodia due to a reduced number of flight departures. Visitors are not required to go to the immigration department office for any kind of exit visa/stamp before departing. All departing visitors can proceed directly to the airport to depart through the normal immigration channels.
Other Visas: For non-tourist visas such as EG visas, there is no automatic extension in place and these can be renewed at any time in the usual way.
If you lose your passport with your Cambodia visa (and corresponding entry stamp), you’ll need to get an exit visa from the Cambodian authorities once you have received an Emergency Travel Document from the British Embassy. An exit visa will cost $30 and must be obtained from the Cambodian Immigration Department in Phnom Penh, 332, Russian Boulevard, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The exit visa will take up to 3 working days to be processed by the Cambodian authorities.
Regional travel
All tourist boats that would enter Cambodia at Kaom Samnor, on the Mekong River, are prohibited from entering
Recent changes to visa requirements for Thailand may affect travellers wishing to make regular crossings at the land border between Cambodia and Thailand. See travel advice for Thailand for further information.
For further information about regional travel, please see the travel advice for the specific country.
More general information on land border crossings from Laos and Vietnam is available e at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & International Co-operation website.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Cambodia. Entry is normally refused if you have a damaged passport or pages missing.
Your passport should also be valid for a minimum period of 6 months for any subsequent renewal or extension of your visa that you apply for from within Cambodia.
Work permits
To work in Cambodia, you’ll need a valid business visa and a valid work permit. Business visas are issued by the Immigration Department and are usually available on arrival in Phnom Penh airport, or at the Immigration Department. You may be able to apply for a Business visa in advance at your nearest Cambodian Embassy. Your employer will need to apply for your work permit from the Department of Labour and Social Affairs.
The Cambodian government is enforcing these rules more strictly than in previous years. There is some uncertainty about whether the government will impose charges retroactively on individuals who did not have valid work permits previously. Procedures are subject to change and you should always consult the relevant Cambodian government department for the latest advice.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Cambodia.
If you’re leaving the country using an ETD issued in Cambodia (and therefore containing no entry stamp), you must get an exit visa prior to departure (see Visa section above for more details).
