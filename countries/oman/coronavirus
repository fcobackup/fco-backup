Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact the Ministry of Health (24441999) or the aviation authorities for information on testing facilities.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Oman
We will update this page when the Government of Oman announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Oman national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Sinovac and Sputnik V may also be available. British nationals resident in Oman are eligible for vaccination, however the Omani government expects sponsors to facilitate COVID-19 vaccinations for their expatriate employees and dependents. If you are resident in Oman, you should check with your sponsor what plans they have in place for vaccinations.
Alternatively, you can register to be vaccinated at personal expense, at any private medical clinic administering COVID-19 vaccines.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Oman, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
