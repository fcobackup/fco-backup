Hurricanes
The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from June to November. You should monitor local and international weather updates from the Antigua & Barbuda Met Office, the World Meteorological Organisation and the US National Hurricane Centre and follow the advice of the local authorities.
The Government of Antigua and Barbuda has issued a Tropical Storm Watch for Tropical Depression 13. A Tropical Storm watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area within 48 hours (by the morning of 22 August).
See our Tropical Cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if youâ€™re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a potential threat and tremors are felt occasionally in the Caribbean. In the event of an earthquake, you should follow the advice of the local authorities. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
