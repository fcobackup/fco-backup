If you’re in Poland and wish to leave, you should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
LOT Polish Airlines special flights
LOT Polish Airlines are operating a limited number of special flights from Warsaw Chopin Airport to the UK. To book seats on remaining flights in these exceptional circumstances, LOT Airlines have asked the British Embassy to collect the full name, contact number and email address for each prospective passenger. If you wish LOT Airlines to contact you about how to book tickets, please submit the necessary information.
The British Embassy in Warsaw will then pass on those details to LOT, who will contact prospective passengers directly to complete the booking, including confirmation of the flight details, and to take a credit or debit card payment. If you are not a British national, please contact your appropriate Embassy in Warsaw. Please note that the British Embassy is not party to any agreement between the customer and the airline and is not in a position to guarantee any flight availability of date preferences. Travellers will still be personally responsible for their travel costs.
Polish authorities may check the temperature of passengers booked onto these special flights and may deny boarding to any passengers displaying relevant symptoms.
Other air travel
The suspension of international air transport has been extended until midnight on 11 April and may be further extended. Almost all flights to the UK have therefore been suspended until this date (see above for special services with LOT Polish Airlines). Please check with your airline for the latest situation.
The Polish government is also arranging charter flights to return Poles and qualifying non-Polish nationals (see below for criteria) to Poland, including from London. Details and ticket information available via LOT Airlines (in Polish)
It will not be possible for non-Polish nationals to enter Poland unless they are:
Spouses and children or individuals under the permanent care of Polish nationals; or
Holders of a Pole’s Card; or
Individuals with the right to permanent or temporary stay in Poland or people with a work permit; or
Foreign nationals driving a means of transport used for transporting goods.
Land borders
The land borders remain open for those leaving Poland at designated land border crossings, though the situation could change rapidly. Countries neighbouring Poland have also introduced border restrictions (Czech Republic, Germany, Lithuania, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine). Check country specific FCO travel advice for details.
On 18 March, Germany introduced further restrictions for EU citizens entering Germany, including by road. EU citizens (including UK Nationals) may still transit Germany from Poland to return home provided they can demonstrate this intention with concrete evidence - for example an onward flight, ferry or train ticket) However, entry is ultimately a discretionary decision for Border Guards.
