There are now a number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the South Pacific. The situation may change rapidly, including in neighbouring countries. Follow local guidance at all times. We advise all non-resident British nationals to leave, and for resident British nationals to be aware of Australia and New Zealand border closures and maintain contact with travel providers on flight restrictions. Kiribati will now deny entry to any travellers who have been in or transited countries with confirmed local transmission within 14 days immediately prior to entering Kiribati. A list of countries covered by these restrictions is available from the Kiribati Ministry of Health and Medical Services.
Further advice is available from Public Health England, and the TravelHealthPro website.
