This page has information on travelling to Bahrain.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Bahrain set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Bahrain’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.’
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
Make sure you check the latest entry requirements with the Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain before you travel.
The Government of Bahrain reintroduced visas on-arrival across the Kingdom’s entry points from 4 September 2020. Travellers can also get a visa in advance, either online or from the Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain in the UK.
Holders of valid visas can enter Bahrain without the need for a letter of prior permission. This excludes visas issued on arrival at Bahrain’s ports and airports. Business visitors should bring a letter of invitation.
Visitors can be issued visas for various lengths up to 6 months, depending on their need and at the discretion of the Immigration Officer. You may be asked to provide evidence of onward or return travel. If you enter as a visitor you must not take up employment.
In Bahrain you can apply to renew your visa at the Nationality, Passports and Residential Affairs department at the Ministry of Interior. You can apply for residency through the Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA). Individuals should enquire about their individual circumstances by visiting the NPRA website.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Bahrain.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Exit requirements
You can be fined if you overstay or fail to extend your legal residency.
Travel bans
You must have legal status in Bahrain when you leave. You may be prevented from leaving Bahrain if you are subject to a travel ban, involved in legal proceedings, have unpaid debt, or are a child subject to a custody dispute.
Travel bans are legal prohibitions the Government of Bahrain imposes to prevent persons involved in disputes from departing the country. They can be the result of a civil or criminal dispute or immigration violation. They are not lifted until the matter, i.e. civil suit; criminal case or immigration violation is settled. Persons who are involved in disputes or investigations can check if travel bans apply with the Bahrain Immigration Department. Often travellers do not learn that they are subject to a travel ban until they attempt to depart the country or on entry into the country.
