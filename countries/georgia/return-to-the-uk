If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Georgia, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
Travelling to the airport
Although there is no public transport, you can get to Tbilisi airport by private car or taxi as long as the social distancing rules are observed (no more than three people in a single vehicle, including the driver, with passengers sitting in the rear).
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
