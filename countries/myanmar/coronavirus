Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Myanmar
A limited schedule of domestic flights is operating, though the rules for access is subject to regular change. You should contact individual airlines for details. You should comply with overnight curfews, and minimise movement during the day, avoiding crowds. If you attempt to travel domestically, you are likely to encounter police or military checkpoints on your journey.
Due to extra COVID-19 checks, it is advisable that foreigners carry:
passport
Form C (immigration document)
Foreigner’s Registration Certificate
Myanmar Driver’s Licence (if you own a car)
a copy of your passport information page
a copy of your Myanmar visa
a copy of your immigration stamp showing when you last entered Myanmar
COVID-19 documentation e.g. proof of vaccination
Accommodation
There have been reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign visitors are staying in registered hotels and guesthouses, and not in private apartments. Due to COVID-19, this is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa.
Some hotels have reopened but many tourist resorts remain closed. You should make sure you have you accommodation booked before travelling.
Public places and services
COVID-19 restrictions remain in place. You must wear a face mask in public places. Failure to wear a mask may result in a fine.
COVID-19 restrictions and policies may change without notice. You are advised to follow local media for updates or check locally within the township where you are.
Healthcare
If you’re currently in Myanmar and are displaying symptoms of COVID-19, you should consult your healthcare provider. There are a small number of private hospitals in Yangon that are equipped to manage patients with severe symptoms.
If you test positive for the virus, you may be transferred to a government quarantine hospital until you have recovered. These vary in quality. Patients in government hospitals are expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to buy food.
It may be difficult for you to travel to a neighbouring country for medical attention if you have COVID-19. You should check your personal arrangements with your healthcare provider.
Prescriptions from the UK are not accepted in Myanmar. Most hospitals, both government and private, have their own pharmacies. A government hospital will provide a prescription for collection at their pharmacy once a patient has been assessed. To attend a private hospital or clinic you must first register, following an assessment any prescription can be collected at the pharmacy on their premises. If you are on regular medication, bring sufficient supplies with you, or is able to have their medication couriered from the UK.
