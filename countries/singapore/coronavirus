Coronavirus travel health
See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Singapore.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. Information on local testing facilities is available.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Singapore
See the Singapore Government website for the latest on the COVID-19 situation and measures in place to curb its spread.
If you do not comply with these measures you could be fined, imprisoned, or both, then deported. Repeat offenders will face further fines and/or prosecution. Be aware that restrictions and penalties are subject to change at short notice.
Public spaces and services
Face masks
You must wear a face mask in public. Some exceptions are: children under 6 years old; anyone eating, drinking or taking medication; or anyone engaged in strenuous exercise. You could be fined, imprisoned, or both if you are found not wearing a face mask without a valid reason.
The Health Sciences Authority’s guide on face masks recommends that masks have at least 2 to 3 layers of fabric.
Trace Together and Health Alerts via SMS
You’ll need to scan in and out of many places using the Trace Together phone app or token:
public buildings
shopping centres and malls
schools
workplaces
places of worship
If you happen to visit a ‘hotspot’ on the same day as someone infected by the virus or been near an infected person you may receive a health alert via SMS and may need to be tested, stay at home for a period or be placed into quarantine. It is a legal requirement to follow the instructions given to you by the Singapore government.
Quarantine and home recovery
If you test positive or if you’re a close contact of someone who has tested positive, you may be required to isolate at home or in a hospital/government facility. Where you isolate will depend on your state of health, how suitable your home is, or whether you live with elderly or at-risk family members.
Those over 70 and those with underlying medical conditions are likely to be quarantined in a government facility.
If a minor or vulnerable person is placed in quarantine, an appropriate carer may be allowed to stay with them.
Children aged 2-11 who test positive can recover at home after being cleared to do so. They should be assessed at a hospital first.
See the Health Ministry’s FAQs and guidelines on gov.sg for more information.
Work
Working from home is still the default. If you must go to work, wear a face mask and keep a distance of one metre from others. Social gatherings at work are not allowed.
Social gatherings and dining out
When meeting up with friends or family:
keep group sizes to a maximum of two people, including for outdoor exercise
two different people (‘unique visitors’) can visit you at home in one day
two people can eat together at a restaurant if they are fully vaccinated. Two people can eat together at a hawker centre together, regardless of vaccination status.
a maximum of two people from different households can take a taxi or private hire car together, but people from the same household can travel in bigger groups.
limit social gatherings to one per day, whether at home or in a public place
keep a distance of one metre from each other
You are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after you’ve completed the required doses of these vaccines: Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca (CoviShield), Janssen (Johnson and Johnson), Sinovac or Sinopharm. The TraceTogether app or token can be used as proof of vaccination status.
If safe distancing is not possible, while on public transport, for example, avoid speaking to each other or talking on the phone.
For guidelines on measures, visit the Ministry of Health or gov.sg websites.
Healthcare in Singapore
For contact details for English speaking doctors see our list of healthcare providers. English is almost universally spoken in Singapore, so all hospitals – whether private or public – will have English-speaking medical staff.
For a complete list of healthcare institutions in Singapore, see the HCI directory.
Anyone requiring a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can get it from one of the clinics approved by the Ministry of Health or at a regional testing centre. These clinics issue digital test result certificates. You should have these digital certificates notarised before you travel.
Antigen Rapid Tests are available to purchase from retailers for those who wish to conduct a self-test.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health. View Health for further details on healthcare in Singapore.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Singapore
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Singapore announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
Vaccination programme eligibility
The Singapore national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. The following foreigners are part of the government’s vaccination programme:
permanent residents (PR)
employment pass (EP) holders
S Pass holders
work permit holders
foreign domestic workers
dependant’s pass holders
long-term visit pass (LTVP) holders
student pass holders
Certain categories of short-term pass holders can now also be vaccinated. You should check the guidelines to see if you qualify and to find out how you can register.
Vaccination using Pfizer-BioNTech (also known as Comirnaty) and Moderna is free of charge. Vaccination with other vaccine brands may be possible at private clinics for a fee.
Third dose booster shots are being made available for those over 50 years old, those in care homes and the immunocompromised. More information, including on registration, can be found at Singapore’s COVID-19 vaccination website.
A Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme exists to cover any vaccine related impacts on health. This is available for residents and long-term pass holders who were vaccinated in Singapore with Pfizer or Moderna.
Updating your vaccination status in Singapore
If you were vaccinated abroad, you can update your records in Singapore if:
you’re a resident or long-term pass holder
you were vaccinated outside of Singapore with one of these vaccines: Pfizer (Comirnaty), Moderna, AstraZeneca (Covishield), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), Sinovac, or Sinopham
you agree to pay for and undertake a serology test in Singapore
Once confirmed, you’ll be recognised as vaccinated on Singapore’s TraceTogether app/token. See the Ministry of Health’s FAQs page for more information.
The local authorities have warned that vaccine-related scams exist.
For any questions about vaccination in Singapore, you should see the Ministry of Health website or call their hotline on 1800-333-9999.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Singapore, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
Proof of vaccination: within Singapore
Once vaccinated in Singapore, your vaccination status is recorded in the national ‘TraceTogether’ app/token. This can be shown at venues or events which require your vaccination status to enter.
Proof of vaccination: other countries
If your country of destination requires a vaccination certificate with a QR code:
visit notarise.gov.sg and log in using your SingPass account
choose the type of document you need
follow the step-by-step guide
Once done, a PDF version of your vaccination certificate with a QR code will be sent to you by email.
This is accessible using your SingPass account, so remember to download the certificate before your employment pass/dependant’s pass is cancelled.
