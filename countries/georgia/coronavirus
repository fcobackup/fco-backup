Travelling from and returning to the UK
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Georgia
We will update this page when the Government of Georgia announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Georgian national vaccination programme started in March 2021 and is using the Sinopharm, Sinovac and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines currently. Booster shots are available for those over 18. British nationals in Georgia for at least 3 months are eligible for vaccination if they choose to join the programme. If you are a permanent resident in Georgia, you can register for vaccination using your residence ID number on the Ministry of Health portal. If you have been in Georgia 3 months or more on a visit, student or work permit, please telephone the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) hotline 1522 with your details.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Georgia, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
Public service halls and community centres can issue COVID vaccination certificates, in addition to those issued by hospitals. These are free of charge. If you need proof of having been vaccinated against COVID in Georgia in order to travel abroad, your vaccination certificate will need to be endorsed by an apostille stamp (legal verification). This chargeable service is available at public service halls and community centres. You will still need to check the entry regulations of the country you wish to visit to find out if a Georgian COVID certificate is valid for entry.
