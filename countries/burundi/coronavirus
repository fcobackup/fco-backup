Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Accommodation
Accommodation remains open but measures may be in place on a case by case basis.
Healthcare
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, the Government of Burundi’s advice is to visit a testing facility for a test. However, you should be mindful that healthcare facilities in Burundi may not match UK standards.
Testing capacity in Burundi is extremely limited and results can be subject to significant delay.
In Bujumbura, those caught not wearing a mask in public gatherings could be fined 100,000 Burundian Francs.
