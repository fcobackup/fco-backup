The local currency is the Mexican Nuevo Peso, known colloquially as ‘Peso’. It’s easier to exchange US dollar travellers’ cheques and notes into local currency than Sterling. UK debit and credit cards are widely accepted for payment and in ATMs. It’s not usually possible to exchange cash at hotel receptions - this can only be done at banks and bureaux de change.

Foreign nationals have been caught up in property scams. Before making financial commitments and buying property in Mexico, you should seek independent qualified legal advice.
