The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and against all but essential travel to the rest of Georgia due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
The British government does not recognise the unilateral declarations of independence made by the de facto authorities in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Consular support is not available in parts of Georgia where the FCO advise against all travel. See Local travel
There are COVID-19 cases in Georgia and the Georgian Government has introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. See Health
With effect from midnight 18 March, for at least a two-week period, foreign citizens will not be allowed to enter the country. The ban will also apply to foreigners with Georgian residence permits. Those already in Georgia will be permitted to leave. Scheduled flight options are now severely limited and reducing daily. British Nationals in Georgia who wish to leave should do so without delays. You should keep in close contact with your travel provider. Cafes and restaurants will close from 19 March, although take-out service will continue. Additional restrictions may be imposed if there is further transmission of virus.
The Georgian authorities are advising anyone who visited The Drunk Cherry pub in Gudauri ski resort after 4 March to self-isolate for 14 days from the date of their last visit.
The political situation in Georgia is generally calm, but demonstrations and opposition rallies are likely, sometimes at short notice. You should remain vigilant, stay away from any large gatherings and demonstrations and follow the advice of local authorities. See Political situation
