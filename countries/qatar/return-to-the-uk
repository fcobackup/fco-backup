Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

If you are a British visitor to Qatar you are advised to return to the UK now, in line with UK government guidance, while there are still commercial routes available.
British nationals resident in Qatar who are considering leaving should contact Qatar Airways to check possible future flight options.
Commercial flights continue to operate from Hamad International airport though many operators have cancelled or reduced routes and all flights are subject to change or cancellation at short notice.
You should check with your airline or travel company for the latest information if you are planning to leave Qatar. For more information check Qatar Airways flights.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.

are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
