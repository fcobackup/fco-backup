All travellers
Entry to Liberia
Before travelling to Liberia, you must have a negative COVID-19 PCR test result from an accredited lab, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. Your test must be conducted a maximum of 72 hours before departure to Liberia.
Before arrival in Liberia, you must download the Lib Travel mobile app from Android Play or the Apple Store. If you have problems with the app, staff at Roberts International Airport can assist you.

You must complete a Health Screening Arrival Form before arrival, for monitoring and contact tracing. You must provide your passport details, contact details in Liberia, next of kin details, your travel details (including flight details, with seat number and any transit locations), any countries visited in the previous 14 days, and you must complete the symptom checker. You must select a payment option for your COVID-19 test (payment via app or payment on arrival). Some travellers have reported problems with online payment. You should ensure you carry sufficient cash (US dollars) for payment on arrival. If double-charged you can present proof of online payment and seek a refund. Each adult traveller must download the app and register individually. You can register children via a parent’s app. When you arrive in Liberia, you must be able to show proof that you have completed the symptom tracker form. If you experience problems using the app, staff will assist you at the airport on arrival.
Currently all land borders (with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire) and ports are open.
Testing / screening on arrival
On arrival at entry points, staff will check your temperature and you must wash your hands with soap and water. You must show your symptom checking screening form (mobile app) to public health staff. You must also show your flight itinerary.
If you display symptoms of coronavirus, public health officials may take you to a government quarantine or medical facility. See Quarantine requirements.
On arrival at Roberts International Airport, all non-exempt travellers will be tested for COVID-19 by National Public Health Reference Laboratory staff using rapid tests. For exemptions, see Exemptions to testing on arrival below. Exempt travellers who do not provide a valid negative PCR test result will also be tested. Sample collection involves taking a swab of the inside of your nose and the back of your throat, using a long cotton bud. Results should be available within 20 minutes.
You must present proof of payment for your test before your sample is collected. Travellers arriving from ECOWAS countries must pay US$50. Travellers from countries outside the ECOWAS region must pay US$75. There are two payment options available. You can pay in advance via the Lib Travel mobile app, or alternatively, you can pay at the United Bank for Africa (UBA) banking window (in US dollars cash or by card) on arrival.
Results should be available in approximately 20 minutes. You must show your negative rapid result to exit the airport.
Any travellers testing positive will be transported by health authorities to the nearest COVID-19 treatment unit and undergo treatment based on Liberia’s Case Management Guidelines. See Quarantine requirements for more information on the Star Base Treatment Unit and conditions for release from Star Base.
Government of Liberia strongly recommends that all travellers self-isolate for 7 days and self-monitor symptoms via the Lib Travel app for 14 days, beginning the day after arrival in Liberia.
For information on testing for travellers departing Liberia, see International Travel.
Procedures for short-term travellers of 1-3 days duration
Short-term travellers whose PCR test results will not be valid for departure from Liberia must have their sample for testing collected at their time of arrival. Short-term travellers should request either an antigen rapid diagnostic test or PCR test from the sample collector, depending on the requirements of their onward travel. Results and travel certificates can be obtained by visiting the Liberia Covid Travel website.
Quarantine requirements
All travellers from South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Eswatini, Mozambique and Lesotho will be taken directly from the airport to the Star Base Precautionary Observation Centre for seven days at their own expense. The cost for lodging and meals for the seven day quarantine period is plus transportation from the airport to Star Base is US$40 per night per person. Exempt travellers from the countries listed above will also be taken to Star Base.
Any travellers receiving a positive rapid test result on arrival at Roberts International Airport will be transported by health authorities to the nearest government COVID-19 Treatment Unit and undergo treatment based on Liberia’s Case Management Guidelines. Travellers who have mild to moderate symptoms (or are asymptomatic) up to 7 days after arrival at a treatment unit will be clinically assessed and will be given a PCR test. Depending on clinical assessment they may be discharged to home-based care between 8-14 days after admission. Critical and severe cases will remain at the treatment unit. PCR test results usually take several days and at busy periods have taken two weeks due to laboratory backlogs. Liberian quarantine and COVID-19 treatment facilities are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards.
There is no quarantine requirement for other travellers who test negative on arrival, however, Government of Liberia strongly recommends that all travellers self-isolate for 7 days and self-monitor symptoms via the Lib Travel app for 14 days, beginning the day after arrival in Liberia.
There is a risk for British nationals of being put into a government quarantine or medical facility, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. Liberian “Precautionary Observation Centers” (POCs) and treatment units are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards.
You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate even after completing your post-arrival self-isolation, if you develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government quarantine facility or treatment unit. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.
If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. The British Embassy cannot provide POC facilities. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to a government POC or treatment centre.
Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), may also be taken to quarantine for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in removal to quarantine.

Exemptions
Cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers with layovers less than 48 hours are exempt from testing if they complete pre-boarding testing as per their airline’s policy and comply with screening procedures while in Liberia. They must complete screening on arrival and proceed to their designated flight crew hotel. If layover is more than 48 hours, cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers must undergo PCR testing before leaving Liberia (see Coronavirus testing for departing travellers). In lieu of testing on arrival, Diplomats and their families, honorary consuls, duly accredited international organisations’ staff and Liberian diplomats must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab. The PCR COVID-19 test must have been conducted within 72 hours of departure to Liberia. If you do not present a valid negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate, NPHIL staff will seek to test you on arrival.
Diplomats, their families and honorary consuls arriving from South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Eswatini, Mozambique and Lesotho are not exempt from testing on arrival.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and quarantine requirements with no advance notice.
