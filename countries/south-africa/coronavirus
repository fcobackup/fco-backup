See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
In response to the new variant, some third countries, including major transit destinations, have also cancelled flights to and from South Africa. If you have a ticket to South Africa booked, you should check with your airline before travelling. You are likely to need a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) COVID-19 test before international travel to and from South Africa. You should check with your airline before travelling about any COVID-19 requirements, including testing.
PCR COVID-19 tests are widely available from private medical facilities and some chemists in South Africa. If you need help finding a COVID-19 PCR test provider you should call The National Institute for Communicable Diseases helpline of (+27) 0800 029 999 for advice on possible testing facilities.
Strict health protocols are also in place for international travellers arriving into South Africa. You will need to show a paper copy of a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) COVID-19 test to border officials upon arrival in South Africa. The test must have taken place no more than 72 hours before your departure. It should be conducted by a certified medical practitioner, and should have the name and signature of the practitioner who conducted the test. You should carry several paper copies of your test, as you may need to present it more than once during your journey. If you do not present proof of a test upon arrival, you may be required to quarantine at your own cost. Children under 5 are not required to provide a PCR test result.
You will need to complete and produce an online travel health questionnaire on your personal device before arriving in South Africa. The questionnaire is available from the South Africa Department of Health See Entry requirements.

Travel in South Africa
Some internal flights are operating.
You must wear a mask if using public transport, which is operating with strict hygiene requirements and reduced passenger numbers.
Children aged six years or younger are not required to wear a face mask.
Failure to comply with South African government regulations could result in a fine or arrest.
Accommodation
Hotels, guest houses and private rental accommodation are allowed to open, with protective measures in place. Upon arrival at your accommodation, you will normally be subjected to a temperature test and asked to declare that you do not have coronavirus symptoms. Some accommodation providers will request your travel history. You should contact your accommodation provider for more information.
Public spaces and services
The South African authorities have published COVID-19 guidelines and advice and have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. Failure to comply could result in a fine or arrest.
South Africa has introduced a risk-based, five-level approach to lockdown restrictions. Level one restrictions are in place across the country.
National restrictions
Level Two lockdown restrictions are in place across the country. There is a curfew between 11pm and 4am. All non-essential businesses are required to close by 10pm. You are legally required to wear a face mask when in public and may face a fine or imprisonment for breaking this rule. You should ensure you are in your accommodation before the curfew begins. Road blocks are used to enforce curfew in some places. International and interprovincial travel remain permitted subject to COVID-19 precautions.
There are rules limiting the number of people who can gather in groups, and concerning the capacity of public places. More details on these can be found in the regulations published by the South African government.
You should comply with any regulations set out by the South African government. See details on regulations and guidance.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in South Africa
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The South African Department of Health is managing the process of vaccine procurement, distribution and administration throughout the country. The details can be found on South Africa’s Government website.
At this stage the vaccine is being distributed to healthcare workers, the over 60s and people in communal settings, such as retirement homes. If you live in South Africa and are in one of those categories, you can register for your vaccine by one of four ways:
Online, at http://vaccine.enroll.health.gov.za
Over the telephone by calling this free number: 0800 029 999
Using your mobile phone by dialling 134832IDnumber# (or if you have no ID number, just dial *134832#)
Using WhatsApp by sending the word REGISTER to 0600123456
The South African Government has indicated that they will aim to make the vaccine available to all adults living in South Africa, regardless of their citizenship or residence status. You should follow the advice given to the general public to access vaccines in accordance with the phased roll out.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
Healthcare in South Africa
If you take regular medication, make sure you can access a repeat prescription if you need to. Most medicines that require a prescription from a doctor in the UK will require a ‘script’ in South Africa (‘script’ is the widely used term in South Africa for ‘prescription’). If you need a prescription in advance, you can visit a local doctor. The doctor might prescribe on the basis of your visit, or they may ask you to obtain an electronic prescription from your medical practitioner in the UK to allow them to write a script. Pharmacies are readily available, with larger pharmacy groups Dis-Chem and Clicks having stores across the country. Some (but not all) of these stores have medical practitioners on site who can write prescriptions.
Private hospitals in South Africa are prepared to treat COVID-19, and the standard of care may be higher than in government hospitals.
For contact details for English speaking doctors, visit our list of doctors.
If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should contact your health insurer for advice. You can also call the South African government local emergency hotline (0800029 999) or consult the online advice.
