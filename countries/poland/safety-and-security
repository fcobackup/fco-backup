Travel from Ukraine
The FCDO currently advises against travel to Ukraine. British nationals in Ukraine should leave now while commercial means are still available.
You should not attempt to cross into Ukraine from Poland. You should abide by the instructions of the authorities at all times.
The main border crossing points into Poland can be found on the Ukrainian government website.
Scheduled train and bus services operate across the Poland/Ukraine border. You must wear a face covering on all public transport in Poland.
Scroll down this page for further advice on driving in Poland. Most car rental companies do not allow you to take your hire car across the Poland/Ukraine border.
Polish COVID-19 regulations apply, as set out in the Entry Requirements section.
Limited access along parts of the Poland/Belarus border
On 30 November 2021, Poland introduced a law limiting access until 1 March 2022 to areas close to the Belarusian border (areas within approximately 3 kilometres from the border) in parts of Podlaskie and Lubelskie Voivodeships. Non-residents of these areas are not allowed access and it is also prohibited to carry firearms, ammunition, explosives and other weapons. You can view the full list of geographical areas covered (in Polish).
You should abide by these regulations at all times and follow the instructions of Polish authorities if you are in these areas.
This law in response to increased migratory pressure on the border, and follows a three-month State of Emergency in the same region.
Crime
Most visitors to Poland experience no difficulties. Serious crime against foreigners is rare, but crimes do occur and in some cases attacks have been racially motivated. You should be alert to the possibility of street crime and petty theft, and that foreigners may appear to be easy targets. Keep valuables and cash out of sight, especially in crowded areas and tourist spots where pickpockets and bag snatchers operate.
There is a higher risk of robbery at main rail stations and on all train services, especially overnight sleeper trains. You are most at risk while boarding and leaving trains.
Unregulated taxi drivers operate at Warsaw airports and elsewhere. They often overcharge. Only use official taxis, which have the name and telephone number of the taxi company on the side of the door and on the top of the taxi. They will also show a rate card on the window of the vehicle. Taxis with a crest but no company name are not official taxis.
Don’t leave drinks or food unattended and beware of accepting drinks from strangers. There have been a small number of reports of drinks being spiked and visitors having their valuables stolen.
Check your bill carefully when buying drinks in bars and nightclubs. There have been some reports of overcharging and of large amounts of money being charged to debit or credit cards.
Demonstrations
Public demonstrations in Poland are common. Marches and gatherings are mostly peaceful and well-policed, but you should take extra care as in any crowded place. Peaceful demonstrations can attract violence. You should monitor local media and follow the instructions of local authorities.
Local travel
Walkers and cyclists must wear a reflective item during darkness when outside a built-up area. Anyone hit by a car or a bike when not wearing a reflective item may be held responsible for the accident. You may get a 100PLN (around £20) police fine for not wearing reflective items.
Public transport
You must validate a public transport ticket at the start of a journey. You will be fined on the spot if you’re travelling with an invalid ticket, usually 266PLN (around £54). You can buy tickets at most newspaper stands and kiosks with a sign reading ‘Bilety’ or ticket machines found in cities.
If you think you may qualify for a cheaper fare (e.g. you are a student or an older person) always double-check the rules as some cheaper fares may only be available to Polish nationals. You’ll be fined if you travel with a cheaper fare ticket that you’re not entitled to.
Road travel
In 2019 there were 2,904 road deaths in Poland (source: Department for Transport). This equates to 7.6 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.6 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2019.

Licences and documents
You can drive in Poland with your UK photocard driving licence without the need for an international driving permit.
If you’re living in Poland, check the Living in Guide for information on the rules for residents.
When driving, you should always have your:
driving licence
ID
car registration papers
car ownership papers
insurance papers
You will need to show these documents if you are stopped by the police or if you cross non-Schengen borders. This includes rental vehicles. If you do not have these papers the police may take your vehicle and charge you for this. If you drive a vehicle in Poland it must meet local technical requirements.
Driving a British car abroad
You may need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. From 28 September, UK stickers replaced GB stickers. Check the GOV.UK Displaying number plates website for more information on what to do if you are driving outside the UK.
Driving regulations
If you break Polish driving laws you should be prepared to pay an on the spot fine of between 50 and 2500 PLN (around £10-500) in cash in Polish currency to the police. If you live in Poland and have a permanent address you may be given a fine that can be paid later.
If you drive and have been drinking (even a single unit of alcohol) you can be charged. The drink-drive limit in Poland is 20 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood – which is lower than the UK. If you are caught driving a car over the alcohol limit or after taking drugs you can be punished by up to 2 years in prison. You might also be prosecuted for cycling on public roads under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
If you turn right on a traffic light displaying a green arrow look out for people on the zebra crossing. They have priority before you.
You must at all times have your headlights on, at least dipped beam.
You must wear a seatbelt in both the front and back seats, even in taxis.
You must not use a mobile phone while driving (unless ‘hands free’).
See the European Commission, AA and RAC guides to driving in Poland.
Tolls
You may need to pay a road toll on some parts of motorways, expressways and national roads. More information is available on the toll operator website.
Road safety
Poland ranks high among European Union countries for road fatalities. Poland is a major east-west transit route for heavy vehicles. The road network is being constantly upgraded, and roadworks are frequent, particularly in summer. Even some main roads between major towns and cities can be narrow and poorly surfaced, making driving after dark particularly challenging.
Dual nationals
If you are a dual Polish-British national and are arrested or detained in Poland, you will be treated as a Polish national by the Polish authorities. You will have the same rights as any other Polish citizen in these circumstances (including the right to legal representation).
