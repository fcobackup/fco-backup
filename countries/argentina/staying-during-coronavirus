This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Argentina as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Argentina to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Argentina
Argentina remains under a nationwide quarantine until at least midnight on 11 October. The restrictions imposed vary significantly between provinces. In most parts of Argentina, you are required to cover your nose and mouth with a facemask or other garment whenever you go out in public. In the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires you must stay in your accommodation. In other parts of the country free movement is allowed within each jurisdiction provided that social distancing rules are adhered to. In all cases you are allowed to travel to an airport if you have a flight booked and you can make single person journeys to buy necessities, such as medicines or foodstuffs, in your local area.
You should check what measures apply in your location in the Ministry of Health website (in Spanish). You could be subject to a financial penalty if you do not abide by local regulations.
Visas
The 90-day permission for tourists to stay in Argentina is being extended each month by 30 days, if your original 90 days expired after 17 March. The latest extension was announced on 18 September.
