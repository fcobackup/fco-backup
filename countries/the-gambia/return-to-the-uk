Gambian airspace has been closed to commercial airlines since 23 March in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus. There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from The Gambia.
There was a UK special flight for British tourists, short term visitors and their direct dependents to return to the UK on 30 April. There are currently no plans for further UK special flights from The Gambia.
The British High Commission Banjul is in contact with airlines, The Gambia authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK are available as soon as possible.
This travel advice will be updated with further information on any future special flights and other options to leave The Gambia as soon as this is available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission Banjul on Twitter and Facebook.
If you cannot leave The Gambia at this time, see advice on staying in The Gambia during coronavirus.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and you have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan to cover the cost of the ticket. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
