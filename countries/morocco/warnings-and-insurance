Earthquake in Morocco
An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit Morocco near Marrakesh on 8 September. Further aftershocks are possible. Follow the advice of local authorities, and the local media.
Morocco is coordinating the humanitarian response to the earthquake. Do not undertake any kind of search and rescue and/or humanitarian assistance work without explicit authorisation from the Moroccan government to do so. Restrictions may be in place around areas of recovery work, and you may disrupt life-saving work by attempting to access these areas or provide assistance without permission.
Moroccan airports are open and flights to and from the UK are running as normal. Some airlines have provided extra seats for travellers who want to return to the UK. Contact your tour operator or airline if you are planning to travel to Morocco soon or if you want to change your flights.
