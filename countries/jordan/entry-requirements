This page has information on travelling to Jordan.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Jordan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Jordan’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
From 1 March 2022, all travellers regardless of their vaccination status, are no longer required to conduct pre-departure PCR tests and PCR tests on arrival in Jordan.
All non-Jordanian travellers, whether vaccinated or not, should complete the Travel To Jordan Declaration Form on the Gateway2Jordan platform and follow all guidance provided by the Government of Jordan.
The Gateway2Jordan form requires all travellers to submit a medical cover declaration. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance. Travel insurance must cover medical costs, emergencies and COVID-19 treatment. All passengers should check requirements with their airlines as visitors may be asked for evidence of insurance upon check-in.
You will need a visa to enter or travel through Jordan as a visitor. This can be acquired on arrival.
For more information on visa requirements, see Visas section.

If you’re transiting through Jordan
Transiting passengers refers to passengers who land between the starting point and final destination of their journey and require to board a connecting flight with either the same airline or a different airline to their final destination.
International Transfer Passengers are permitted through Jordanian airports.
Passengers who transit through Jordan on their way to another country must stay within the airport airside areas, follow signs for transfer passengers, and comply with any airport security screening procedures before connecting onto your next flight.
If you are transiting through Jordan on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel outside of the airport for a flight the next day, you need to check-in again and go through immigration.
Exemptions
Medical tourists are exempt from the health insurance requirement.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are visiting Jordan, your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the time you arrive.
Dual nationals
If you are a British/Jordanian national, you are allowed to use your British passport on arrival, but will need to show your Jordanian passport on departure.
Visas
You can buy a single entry visit visa valid for one month on arrival at the airports or the Sheikh Hussein/North Border crossing at the Jordan/Israel border. The cost is 40 Jordanian Dinars. Some airlines may require passengers to submit a health declaration at the check-in counters.
An exit tax, currently 10 Jordanian Dinars, is payable at all border crossings, except the airports.
If you’re entering for tourism you can get a combination of a visa and reduced cost entry to the major tourism sites by applying for a Jordan Pass online.
You can extend your visa after you arrive in Jordan up to a maximum period of 6 months. If you overstay your visa you will be fined. You can apply to extend your visa using the following website. Payment is accepted online.
Land crossings
Land crossings are operating between Israel and Jordan and between the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Jordan. You can find the latest guidance on entering and exiting Israel via the land borders on the Israeli Ministry of Health’s website. If you wish to combine travel to Jordan with a visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, you can obtain a multiple entry visa before you travel from the Embassy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in London.
Previous travel to Israel
Evidence of a previous visit to Israel like an Israeli entry/exit stamp in your passport does not normally cause any difficulties when entering Jordan. It is, however, for the Jordanian authorities to determine the right of entry into the country. If you have any concerns, you should contact the Consulate of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in London.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
HIV test
You must undergo an HIV test if you intend to stay in Jordan for more than 30 days, either as a resident or as a long-term visitor. The fee to obtain the health certificate is currently 20 Jordanian Dinars.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK emergency travel documents are accepted for entry, transit and exit from Jordan.
However, for entry and transit using an emergency travel document, you’ll need to get a visa from the Jordanian Embassy in the country where the document was issued. For exit using an emergency travel document, you’ll need to get a stamp from the Immigration & Residency department in Amman (not at the airport). A minimum of one month remaining validity is required on an emergency travel document.
Dual nationals
If you are a British/Jordanian national, you are allowed to use your British passport on arrival, but will need to show your Jordanian passport on departure.
