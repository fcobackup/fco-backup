On-the-spot fines are common and can be given for a wide range of behaviours which are tolerated in the UK. You can be fined for littering and for smoking in some public places. It’s also illegal to import chewing gum into the country, except for certain medical chewing gums.
Drunk and disorderly conduct
Drunk and disorderly conduct is a serious crime in Singapore. You should drink responsibly and know your limits.
Depending on the severity of the crime, convicted offenders may face up to S$5,000 (about £2,500) in fines, up to 15 years’ imprisonment, or caning.
Drinking in public places
It’s illegal to drink alcohol in a public place between the hours of 10.30pm and 7am, except in restaurants, bars and cafes (note this is also currently prohibited as part of Singapore’s pandemic response measures), the outdoor areas of private condominiums and chalets, and at outdoor events that have obtained a permit.
Geylang and Little India are designated as ‘Liquor Control Zones’. Drinking in public places is prohibited all weekend, on public holidays and on the eve of public holidays. If you ignore this, you could be fined up to S$1,000 (approximately £500). Repeat offenders could be fined up to S$2,000 (about £1,000) or sent to prison for up to 3 months.
E-cigarettes and smoking
You cannot bring vaporisers, like e-cigarettes, e-pipes, e-cigars and refills into the country. These items are likely to be confiscated, and you could be fined or sent to prison.
The minimum age for the purchase, use, possession, sale and supply of all tobacco products in Singapore is 21 years old. Failure to comply carries fines. Along Orchard Road smoking is only permitted in designated smoking areas.
Visa overstay
Penalties for overstaying your visa include fines, imprisonment, corporal punishment (caning) and deportation depending on the length of overstay.
LGBT
Male homosexual acts are illegal in Singapore, but in a statement to Parliament in 2007 Singapore’s Prime Minister said that ‘the government does not act as moral policemen’ and that ‘we do not proactively enforce’ the law on this issue. Openly gay and lesbian support groups and social venues exist. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
Outrage of modesty
You should avoid any action that could be interpreted as molestation. Scams involving false claims of molestation are thought to exist. Penalties for convicted offenders include a fine, imprisonment, and/or corporal punishment (caning).
Death penalty
The death penalty exists for certain offences, including murder and drug trafficking. Trafficking is defined by possession of drugs above a certain amount (500g in the case of cannabis). There are severe penalties for all drug offences in Singapore, including possession. The Misuse of Drugs Act sets out the definitions.
Retention of passports during police investigations
If you’re the subject of a police investigation, your passport will be confiscated by the authorities. It will be returned to you once the investigation has concluded (if you’re convicted, it will be returned after you have served your sentence).
Investigations can take anywhere from a few days to many months, depending on the crime. In most cases, you aren’t allowed to leave Singapore while the investigation is ongoing. You must be able to support yourself financially during this period. The British High Commission cannot interfere in these investigations, nor negotiate the release of your passport.
Dual nationals and Permanent Residents
Singapore doesn’t recognise dual nationality beyond the age of 21. The following are liable for National Service:
all male Singapore citizens (including dual citizens below 21)
all male children granted Permanent Resident (PR) status as part of their parents’ PR application
Specific questions regarding National Service issues can be put to Singapore’s Central Manpower base: contact@ns.sg
