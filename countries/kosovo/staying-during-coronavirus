When outside, you are recommended to keep your mouth and nose covered and maintain a distance of 2m from other people.

The authorities in Kosovo have set up an online platform with basic information and advice available in English. There is a local Emergency Hotline for people who think they may have coronavirus or are struggling with psychological issues. The number is 038 200 80 800.
Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Kosovo, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
