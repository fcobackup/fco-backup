The hurricane season in the Caribbean normally runs from June to November. You should monitor the progress of storms on the website of the US National Hurricane Centre and follow the advice of the local authorities. Direct hits are, historically, rare. Hotel management and local radio stations will pass on government advice if a hurricane is forecast.
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
