This page has information on travelling to Latvia. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Latvia set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
Before travel to Latvia, everyone (including children below age of 12) must complete and submit an electronic form Covidpass no earlier than 48 hours before entering Latvia. See the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for detailed information on requirements for travellers arriving in Latvia. All travellers arriving in Latvia by air can take a voluntary, government-paid COVID-19 test at Riga International Airport.
If you’re fully vaccinated
If you are fully vaccinated and have not been in a red list country in the past 14 days, you are exempt from the requirement of testing prior to arrival in Latvia.
At least 14 days must have passed since being fully vaccinated (with both doses of a 2-dose vaccine or one dose of a single-dose vaccine) before arrival in Latvia. The date of vaccination must be specified and your final dose of primary vaccination must have been administered within 270 days prior to travel to Latvia. If you completed your vaccination (with both doses of a 2-dose vaccine or one dose of a single-dose vaccine) more than 270 days prior to travel to Latvia, you must be able to show proof of having receiving a booster jab.
Prior to travelling to Latvia, you should check the list of countries included in the weekly COVID-19 risk assessment, published every Friday by the Latvian Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
Proof of vaccination status
Latvia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel and you need to have had a vaccine authorised by the European Medicines Agency or by the World Health Organisation.
Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative PCR test (taken no more than 72 hours before entry) or an antigen test (taken no more than 48 hours before entry) when entering Latvia. See information on getting a test before entry. The certification must be in English, French, Russian or in the official language of the country from where the journey begins.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past six months
If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last six months, you can enter Latvia. You’ll need to show the interoperable EU COVID certificate issued to certify recovery from COVID-19. The COVID-19 recovery certificate is valid for 180 days. Persons who have recovered from COVID-19 can obtain a vaccination certificate by receiving any of the vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency.
If you have recovered from COVID-19 in last six months and have not been in red list countries in the past 14 days, you are exempt from the requirement of testing prior to or after arrival in Latvia.
You can use a UK COVID Pass or a UK proof of COVID-19 recovery record to demonstrate proof of COVID-19 recovery when entering Latvia.
Children and young people
Children below the age of 12 do not need to show proof of vaccination or negative test to enter Latvia.
Children aged 12 and above must hold a COVID-19 vaccination or recovery certificate or follow the rules for non-vaccinated travellers when arriving in Latvia.
If you’re transiting through Latvia
If you are transiting Latvia in a personal vehicle you must leave the country within12 hours after entering Latvia.
Airline passengers transiting Latvia are exempt from testing requirements as long as they do not leave the airport terminals and are able to present proof that their onward flight is within the next 24 hours.
Exemptions
Exemptions to the rules may apply for:
employees, crew members of freight and passenger transport service providers, crews of passenger, freight, or technical voyages;
seafarers and members of the merchant marine on their way to or returning from a ship;
the staff of foreign diplomatic and consular missions, international organisations and representations thereof accredited in Latvia, and their family members;
persons arriving in Latvia on an invitation from the President, the Saeima, the Cabinet or its member, the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, the State Audit Office, or a ministry;
diplomatic couriers of Latvia or foreign countries or ad hoc diplomatic couriers;
holders of the diplomatic passport of the Republic of Latvia, technical personnel accompanying them, and the civil servants and employees of the diplomatic or consular service when performing the official functions.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must meet the Schengen area rules.
Your passport must meet 2 requirements. It must be:
less than 10 years old on the day you enter (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
We are asking the European Commission to clarify the 10-year rule. Their guidance for Schengen border guards may not be updated until the spring of 2022. Until then, for some Schengen countries your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the 3 months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date.
Check both the issue date and the expiry date in your passport. If you renewed your passport early, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. This could affect the requirement for your passport to be less than 10 years old.
Contact your travel provider or embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Latvia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Latvian government’s entry requirements. Check with the Latvian Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
If you are travelling to Latvia for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Latvia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through the Latvia as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Latvia, read our Living in Latvia guide for passport stamping information.
Health insurance
You are required to have health insurance when you enter Latvia. This must include repatriation costs. Those who require visas for Latvia (other than EU family members) will need to show their policies upon arrival in Latvia.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Latvia.
