This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Morocco as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Morocco to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Morocco
For information on entering Morocco, see Entry Requirements
A night-time movements ban from 7pm to 5am is in effect from the start of Ramadan on 25 April.
All movement around Morocco, and within towns and cities is restricted to buying essential supplies or seeking medical assistance, including from pharmacies. Such movement requires an “exceptional movement certificate” from the Moroccan authorities. Movement to and from work is permitted only with written permission from your employer as well as the “exceptional movement certificate”.
In order to get an “exceptional certificate of movement”, you will need to:
visit this Moroccan Ministry of Interior website, and download the certificate. This is an official certificate and exists only in Arabic
complete the certificate with the necessary details of movement, and sign it
give it the nearest local government representative to countersign it
carry the authorised certificate with you
If you do not read/write Arabic, you may wish to ask hotel staff or a trusted local companion to assist you with completing the certificate.
Schools, universities and all public amenities and public spaces, including theatres, cinemas, gyms and swimming pools have been shut to the general public. Restaurants and bars have been closed, but food delivery services continue to operate.
The Moroccan authorities have announced that wearing a mask outside your home is now mandatory. Failing to respect the rules can lead to a prison sentence of up to three months or a fine of up to MAD 1300.
Visas
The Interior Ministry has issued instructions to regional authorities to ensure that anyone overstaying their visa due to the border closure will be able to leave without penalty when the borders re-open.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Morocco, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
