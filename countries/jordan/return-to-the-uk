If you’re in Jordan, you’re strongly advised to immediately review your travel plans and consult your insurance provider, tour operator, and transport or accommodation provider about the impact on your plans.
On 14 March, the Jordanian Government announced that commercial flights in to and out of Jordan will be stopped and all land and sea borders will be closed at 11.59pm on Monday 16 March. This decision is due to be reviewed on 30 March.
We are seeking, in conjunction with international partners, to arrange a flight with Qatar Airways leaving Jordan on 28th March. The flight will be to Doha, where it is still possible to arrange onward commercial travel to the UK. The flight is operating on a commercial basis and Qatar Airways have informed us that tickets to a range of UK destinations will be around 1599 JOD.
In line with the FCO Travel Advice of 23 March, British Nationals who have travelled to Jordan and who now find themselves without travel options to return home are the priority for places on this flight. If you are in this category and interested in purchasing a ticket on this flight, please send a copy of your passport biodata and visa stamp pages to Cons.Amman@fco.gov.uk by 08:00 on 25th March. The Embassy will then reply on 25 March with further details. You cannot purchase tickets for this flight through other means.
It is important to note that there are still many obstacles that need to be overcome in order to ensure the successful operation of this flight and while we are working closely with Qatar Airways and the Jordanian Authorities, we cannot guarantee that this flight will go ahead. We will, however, do everything in our power to ensure that it does.
We are helping to reduce travel costs by encouraging airlines to have maximum flexibility on changing return tickets. Where people are in real need, our consular teams will work with them to consider their options. As a last resort, we offer an emergency loan.
