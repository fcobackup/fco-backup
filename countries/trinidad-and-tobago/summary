The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Trinidad and Tobago based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
If you are returning to the UK from Trinidad and Tobago, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
Trinidad and Tobago’s international borders are closed. There are currently no commercial flight options available for travelling into or out of Trinidad and Tobago. British nationals wishing to enter or depart from Trinidad and Tobago via other available options must first obtain a travel exemption to do so from Trinidad and Tobago’s Ministry of National Security via an online application and follow local advice.
There has been some regional flight disruptions as a result of volcanic ash connected to volcanic activity on the island of St Vincent. The situation continues to change and persons wishing to travel should check with their airline for flight information, as further disruptions cannot be ruled out.
