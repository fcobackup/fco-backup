Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Cape Verde. The Cape Verdean authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. The authorities have closed all sea borders and have restricted flights from the UK, US, Canada and a number of other European countries from 18 March. The authorities have also placed the island of Boa Vista into quarantine. However, a restricted number of flights are allowed into the country to enable visitors to return home, including those in hotels in Boa Vista where there are confirmed or suspected coronavirus cases. Contact your tour operator or airline to make sure you have the latest information on your travel plans.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. The government of Cape Verde has set up a free helpline which you can call if you have any information or concerns about coronavirus: +238(0)800-1112. This helpline is only available in Portuguese.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Cape Verdean embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website.
