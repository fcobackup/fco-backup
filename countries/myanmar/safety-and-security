Political situation
Myanmar held national elections on 8 November 2020 in which the National League of Democracy Party won a majority. Since then, the political situation has deteriorated. As of 1 February, the Myanmar Military have declared a state of emergency and assumed control. Figures in the Civilian Government, civil society and a foreign national have been detained by the military. There is an increased security presence across the country. You should remain cautious and avoid all demonstrations, large crowds and political gatherings.
Myanmar has suffered from prolonged internal conflicts, involving a number of non-state armed groups from Myanmar’s border areas. Ten Ethnic Armed Groups and the government have signed a Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement. Additional armed actors have bilateral ceasefire agreements with the government. The military seizure of power has led to the suspension of some of these agreements. However, even where there are ceasefires in place, the possibility of violent clashes remains in some areas of all border states including Shan, Rakhine, Chin, Kachin, Kayah, Karen/Kayin, and Mon. You should review the advice for each state before you visit, and seek advice from a local guide or tour operator where appropriate. There is no formal ceasefire as yet in Kachin State or in northern Shan State’s Kokang Self-Administered Zone.
The political situation remains unsettled. Restrictions on freedom of assembly, movement and the right to form trade unions remain in place following extremely narrow legislative reforms. Restrictions on freedom of speech, movement, religion, and political activity remain, and under current laws criticism of the government can result in imprisonment, detainment and deportation. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings.
In the past, there have been acts of politically motivated violence around public holidays like Armed Forces Day (27 March) and Martyrs Day (19 July). On other anniversaries, like the 8 August 1988 uprising against the government and the September 2007 protests, you can expect to see an increase in security forces in Yangon and elsewhere in Myanmar. This is particularly true since the military’s seizure of power.
You should avoid all demonstrations and large political gatherings or crowds. You should not attempt to photograph any gatherings. See Photography and drones for more information. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities. You are advised to stay home, except for the collection of essential provisions.
Crime
There have been incidents of hostility aimed at foreigners following pro-military protests in Yangon. You should remain alert at all times.
There are no officially issued accurate crime statistics. Anecdotal evidence suggests occasional instances of violent crime against foreigners. The most common crimes are non-violent crimes of opportunity (pickpocketing, theft of unattended possessions in public places or hotel rooms, bag snatching, gem/confidence scams). At night, it is recommended that visitors explore city sights in groups or with a partner. Thieves often attempt to distract a victim by asking questions, begging for money, selling items, or bumping/jostling. You should take extra care of your belongings and take sensible security precautions at all times.
Myanmar is still largely a cash-only society. Travellers, who often need to carry large sums of local currency, should avoid displaying cash or other valuables in public. Beware of merchants offering to sell gems, gold, semi-precious stones. This could result in substantial loss of money and/or a violation of local laws. Do not buy gems or minerals from an unlicensed source.
Scams
There have been incidents where people have received emails from individuals claiming to work for British firms seeking loans to advance their business interests in Myanmar. These have stated they are acting on advice of the British Embassy. See our pages on fraud and financial scams for further guidance.
Local travel
The Ministry of Hotels, Tourism and Sport maintains a list of approved destinations. Tourists can visit Yangon, Mandalay, Bago and Irrawaddy regions without restrictions. Other destinations are subject to limitations (eg access by air or train but not by road). For more information, contact the Myanmar Ministry of Hotels and Tourism.
Individuals with disabilities or access requirements should be prepared to face difficulties throughout Myanmar. Roads and pavements are often difficult to cross. Ramps and accessible facilities are rare.
Border areas
The Myanmar government restricts travel to most border areas. Be particularly vigilant and take extra care in border areas. Unmarked landmines also pose a threat in many border regions. There is ongoing military activity close to borders with Bangladesh, Thailand, Laos, India and China especially in Rakhine, Chin, Shan and Kachin States. There are occasional clashes in Karen/Kayin State (Myawaddy and Kawkareik) and Mon State (Kyaik Mayaw). You should seek advice from guides or tour operators before travelling.
Do not attempt to cross any border illegally or enter restricted areas without the appropriate permissions from the Myanmar authorities.
Landmines
As a result of years of conflict, the threat of landmines in rural areas is high, particularly in northern and central Rakhine, northern Shan and Kachin States. There is no reliable land mine mapping source. Some areas with known mines are marked by signage, however this practice is not widespread. Visitors should exercise extreme caution if travelling off main roads in these areas. On 26 November 2019 a foreign tourist was killed by a landmine while travelling off the main road in Northern Shan State in the area around Hsipaw town. A woman accompanying him was also injured in the incident.
Air travel
The FCDO can not offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s unsafe. A list of recent incidents and accidents is available on the website of the Aviation Safety Network.
Airlines routinely share flight codes, meaning that airlines sometimes use aircraft from outside their own fleet. Passengers aren’t always advised in advance where this is the case.
Local flight schedules are subject to change without warning. Leave sufficient time in your travel itinerary to accommodate this.
Rail travel
Railway safety standards are significantly below those in the UK.
Road travel
Overland travel can be hazardous, particularly in the rainy season (May to October). Roads can become impassable and bridges damaged. Travel by road between many areas outside the key destinations of Yangon, Mandalay, Bago and Irrawaddy regions is restricted. Check with your tour operator or the Ministry of Hotels, Tourism and Sport before travelling.
Road safety standards are significantly lower than in the UK. Under Myanmar law, the driver of a car involved in an accident with a pedestrian is always at fault. Many vehicles, including taxis and buses, are in a poor mechanical state, and serious road traffic accidents are common. Although driving is on the right in Myanmar, the majority of cars are right hand drive.
You should avoid travel where possible on the main Mandalay-Naypyitaw-Yangon road at night, due to bad lighting and poor road surfacing.
Due to COVID-19 the border between India and Myanmar is currently closed. All other land borders are closed to foreigners.
Sea and river travel
Seek local advice about where it is safe to swim or dive in the sea. River transport may not meet internationally recognised safety standards and search and rescue facilities may be limited.
Passenger ferries have been subject to attacks in Rakhine State.
During the monsoon season (normally May to October), heavy rains can cause flooding. Make sure life jackets are available and check local weather conditions before undertaking any river journey. All travellers should avoid wading, swimming or bathing in freshwater to prevent catching schistosomiasis. See Health
Swimming and scuba diving
Exercise caution at beach resorts in Ngwe Saung, Chaung Tha and Ngapali as there are strong underwater currents and riptides. There are no lifeguards and drownings have occurred. Due to Coronavirus, these resorts are currently closed.
If you’re considering diving excursions in Myanmar, make sure you’re happy with the safety measures in place. Rented diving equipment may not meet internationally acceptable safety standards and may not be maintained adequately.
Mobile phones and Internet
Due to current events, phone and internet services are intermittent.
Myanmar’s technological infrastructure is improving rapidly and foreign visitors and residents can expect to see significant change in the near future.
International GSM roaming is now available in Myanmar and all local networks offer 3G and 4G. If roaming is enabled, some UK SIM cards will work and coverage is fairly reliable in the main cities. UK mobile service providers may charge especially high prices for roaming in Myanmar.
Many visitors travel with a spare mobile phone and buy a SIM card when they arrive (approximately 1500 Kyat – about £1). This can then be topped up as needed.
