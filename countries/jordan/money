Cash machines are available throughout Amman and in other major towns and cities. ATMs are less widely available in rural areas, though most petrol stations on major roads offer ATMs.
During Ramadan, banks will be open between 1030 â€“ 1430 daily. But ATM machines remain available and continue to be refilled.
