The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
The Bulgarian Government has announced severe restrictions on international travel, forbidding entry to British nationals, except for those with permanent or long term residence in Bulgaria. These restrictions remain in place in spite of the recent relaxation of some domestic measures.
Commercial flights are operating at a reduced level. Most land borders are closed for passenger traffic. If you need to travel, plan ahead and before you travel check border information published by the Ministry of Interior (English and Bulgarian).
Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
