This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Guatemala set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
You must keep to the social distancing rules. From 18 July 2022, the Government of Guatemala has declared that the use of masks throughout Guatemala is optional, except in hospitals, medical clinics, vaccination centres, medical laboratories, nursing homes, prisons, and on public transportation, where it remains mandatory to wear masks.
From 11 March 2022, all British nationals, Guatemalan nationals, diplomats and foreign nationals resident in Guatemala who wish to enter Guatemala must present either:
proof of a full course of COVID-19 vaccination (if aged 12 and over) (two doses; or one for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine). The last dose must have been administered no less than 2 weeks prior to the date of travel. See ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’ below. If vaccination is not possible as a result of a medical condition, you should present proof of that medical condition; or
a negative COVID-19 PCR or antigen test (if aged 10 and over) dated no more than 3 days before the date of your arrival in Guatemala. The 3 days are measured from the date and time the test is conducted to the moment you check in with the airline, or arrive at the land border
There are no quarantine requirements.
Local authorities have advised against travel if suffering from any respiratory disease or presenting COVID-19 symptoms.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Guatemala will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Testing/screening on arrival
You should comply with any additional screening or testing measures put in place by the authorities.
Testing on departure
There is currently no testing upon departure in Guatemala. They will take your temperature upon arrival at the airport.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British citizens do not need a visa to visit Guatemala for up to 90 days. For further information on entry requirements for tourists and for those planning to work in Guatemala, contact the Guatemalan Embassy in London.
If you wish to extend your visa, you must submit an application to the Guatemalan Institute of Migration in Guatemala City. You can find more information on the website of the Guatemalan Institute of Migration (in Spanish).
If you overstay your visa then you should expect to pay a fine before leaving the country. This fine can only be paid at the main Migration office in Guatemala City. While fines can be paid at the airport or land borders, it is strongly recommended that payment be made at the Migration office, as the administrative process at the airport could cause serious delays.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of six months from the date of entry into Guatemala.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry to and exit from Guatemala. ETDs must have a minimum period of 6 months validity from the date you enter Guatemala.
If you’re travelling via the United States of America on an ETD, you’ll need to get a USA visa. For more information, please contact the USA Embassy in Guatemala.
Central America Border Control Agreement
Guatemala is part of the Central America Border Control Agreement (CA-4). Under the terms of this agreement, British tourists can travel within any of the CA-4 countries (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua) for a period of up to 90 days which starts at the first point of entry of any of the CA-4 countries. They will be subject to immigration checks at the border (which does not interrupt or restart the 90 day count). Fines are applied for travellers who exceed this 90-day limit, although a request for an extension can be made for up to 30 days by paying a fee before the 90 days limit expires. If you are expelled from any of the four countries you are also excluded from the entire CA-4 region.
If you are planning on travelling to Nicaragua, before you travel please check information on entry requirements with your travel company, the Nicaraguan Immigration authorities, or your nearest Nicaraguan Embassy. Please also check our travel advice for Nicaragua.
Departure tax
There is a US$30 (or Quetzal equivalent) airport departure tax, which is normally included in the price of the ticket.
When crossing into Guatemala by land border, there have been numerous reports of customs/immigration officials charging an “entry fee”. This is illegal. By asking for an official receipt for your money you may find that the “fee” is dropped.
When entering the country, make sure your passport is stamped by a migration official. If you enter Guatemala without obtaining the relevant stamp, you are likely to receive a fine and may experience delays when leaving the country.
When crossing into Guatemala by the land border at El Carmen, be wary of people offering to help process your entry into the country.
