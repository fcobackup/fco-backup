There are currently very limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Pakistan. The Government has suspended normal scheduled international flights to and from Pakistan until at least 21 April.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Pakistan. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Pakistan authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
UK special charter flights
From 21 April, the UK will operate a series of special charter flights from Islamabad and Lahore for British nationals who normally live in the UK and their direct dependents to return to the UK.
This round of chartered flights will include three flights from Islamabad to Heathrow, four flights from Islamabad to Manchester, two flights from Lahore to Heathrow, and one flight from Lahore to Manchester.
British nationals on short-term visits to Pakistan should take the earliest available opportunity to return to the UK by visiting the booking portal and completing the online form.
