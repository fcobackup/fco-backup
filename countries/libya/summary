The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advise against all travel to Libya. This advice has been in place consistently since 2014. If you’re in Libya against this advice, you should seek to leave immediately by any practical means.
All travel to, from and within Libya is at the traveller’s risk. Local security situations are fragile and can quickly deteriorate into intense fighting and clashes without warning.
Travel to Libya is subject to entry restrictions
Due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Libya’s air, land and maritime borders have regularly been closed, without notice.
If you plan to travel against FCDO advice, see Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

Military clashes and inter-militia fighting pose significant risks to air travel in Libya. It has periodically caused the temporary suspension or closure of airports. All airports are vulnerable to attack. Mitiga Airport, Tripoli’s only functioning civilian airport, has been regularly shelled by artillery, most recently on 9 May 2020. FCDO staff do not regularly travel by air to or from Mitiga. See Air travel
Since April 2019, there has been a significant build-up of militarised forces across western and central Libya. See Safety and security
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Libya. In August 2019, a car bomb explosion in the eastern city of Benghazi killed five, including three foreign nationals. There remains a high threat throughout the country of terrorist attacks and kidnap against foreigners, including from Daesh-affiliated extremists (formerly referred to as ISIL) and Al Qaida, as well as armed militias. Daesh and Al Qaeda have attacked a number of oil and gas installations and killed or kidnapped workers, including foreign nationals. See Terrorism
In August and September 2020 both Tripoli and Benghazi saw demonstrations against deteriorating living conditions and corruption. Pockets of violence were seen, with reports of civilians being shot and wounded.
If you choose to travel to Libya against FCDO advice, you should get the right visa, or risk deportation. See Entry requirements
