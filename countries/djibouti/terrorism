Djibouti and international interests within Djibouti (including several military bases and personnel and hotels, and other public places frequented by foreigners) may be seen as a legitimate target by Al Shabaab because of Djiboutian participation in the African Union peacekeeping mission, ATMIS, and international support to the Somali Government. Al Shabaab has previously issued public threats against Djibouti. In May 2014, they claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at a restaurant in Djibouti City, which injured foreign nationals.
Be vigilant at all times, especially in crowded areas and public places like transport hubs, hotels, restaurants, shopping areas and bars, and during major gatherings like sporting or religious events. Previous terrorist attacks in the region have targeted places where football matches were being viewed.
Follow the advice of local authorities, take care while travelling around the country and avoid large gatherings.
