Read the Prime Minister’s address for the latest information.

There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Nigeria. All airports in Nigeria are closed to all international commercial flights until at least 4 June.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Nigeria. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Nigerian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
What to do
If you cannot leave Nigeria at this time, you should:
Follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus;
Find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs;
Keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well.

Future options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Nigerian authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible. We are assessing British nationals’ interest in further UK special flights from Nigeria. If you are looking to return to the UK, let us know by registering your details on our online form as soon as possible. If you have already received an email from our commercial partner CTM telling you that your details are on our system then you do not need to fill out this form.
This section of the travel advice will be updated when departure options become available.
Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter and Facebook: @UKinNigeria and @DFIDNigeria.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
