Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting. If you will pass through a red list country, book your hotel quarantine package before travelling to the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should check that the test result can be provided in the correct format and language.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Moving around in Slovenia
Movement between all statistical regions is permitted.
Public spaces and further measures
A surgical mask or FFP2 type mask must be worn in all enclosed public spaces, on public transport, in open places and outside where a distance of 1.5 metres cannot be maintained and in private vehicles when travelling with members of other households for work purposes.

Unless stated elsewhere, the rules below apply to all of Slovenia. Further details can be found on the Slovene government website.
All businesses, establishments and services (including shops, restaurants, bars and public transport) are required to ensure their staff and customers (including children aged 12 years and above) meet one of the following criteria: are fully vaccinated, have a negative COVID-19 test, or have evidence of recovery from COVID-19 in the last 180 days. When travelling in Slovenia you will see this requirement signposted in many establishments as ‘PCT’ You should expect to be asked to show evidence that you meet one of these requirements, together with a valid identity document, before accessing a service, including when seated outdoors. The only exceptions to this requirement are: emergency departments in hospitals; COVID testing and COVID and flu vaccine centres; grocery stores and pharmacies that are not located inside shopping malls; and charities providing urgent support. In grocery stores and pharmacies you should expect social distancing measures of 10 square metres per customer to be in place, and a sign at the entrance showing the maximum number of people that are allowed inside
Slovenia will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. If you are travelling with a printed NHS PDF proof of vaccination status, it must be dated 1 November onwards and be the version for travel purposes, not the version for domestic use in the UK, in order to ensure that the certificate can be scanned successfully, if certification in Slovenia is required. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you hold a Slovenian health card, rapid antigen tests are available free of charge at test centres. If you do not hold a Slovenian health card, you should expect to pay for a test. See the list of test centres.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Slovenia
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Slovenia announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Slovenian national vaccination programme started in December 2020 and is using the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Moderna vaccines. The use of Janssen (Johnson and Johnson) has been suspended. The Government of Slovenia has stated that British nationals resident in Slovenia are eligible for vaccination. You should register your interest online via the zVEM service, and also notify your doctor in Slovenia. You will need your EMŠO (Identity card) number and your Slovene health insurance card. The vaccine registration facility is only available in Slovene, so you might need some assistance if you don’t speak Slovene.
Alternatively, you can go to one of the pop-up vaccination centres across the country (no appointment necessary) or view the current schedule (in Slovene).
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in Slovenia, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
If you receive your COVID-19 vaccination in Slovenia, you can get an EU Digital COVID Certificate from the national authorities. The Certificate proves that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result, or recovered from COVID-19. It will help facilitate your travel within the EU and, in some countries, you can use it to demonstrate your COVID-19 status to businesses and other organisations. For further information visit the European Commission’s EU Digital COVID Certificate page.
