The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for Equatorial Guinea remains in place:
The FCO advise against all travel to Equatorial Guinea. This is due to the Equatorial Guinea authorities announcing land border closures and restrictions to international flights as a measure to reduce the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Equatorial Guinea. The Equatorial Guinea authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. See Coronavirus
Whilst borders are closed and international flights suspended, the British High Commission in Yaoundé, Cameroon will only be able to provide limited consular support.
Be alert and take sensible personal security precautions. Roadblocks and unannounced identification checks are likely. Carry an appropriate form of identification (passport or residence permit) with you at all times. See Crime and Road travel
If you wish to travel outside Malabo on the island of Bioko, or outside Bata on the mainland, you will need to inform the local authorities in advance. See Local travel
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Equatorial Guinea, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before you travel.
