Vanuatu sits along a volatile seismic strip called the ‘Ring of Fire’ in the Pacific. Volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tsunamis are possible.
Tropical cyclones
The tropical cyclone season in Vanuatu normally runs from November to April. Throughout this period there is a high risk of strong winds and heavy rains with associated flooding, landslides and road closures.
Monitor local and international weather updates from the World Meteorological Organisation, the Vanuatu Meteorological Service, local newspapers and local radio.
Vanuatu continues to recover from the impact of a direct hit from category 5 cyclone Pam in March 2015.
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you’re caught up in a storm.
Earthquakes
Vanuatu is prone to significant year round seismic and volcanic activity, with over 2,000 seismic events reported each year. Most events are small scale, although larger tremors and quakes of over 5 on the Richter scale do occur on a regular basis. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
Volcanoes
Take care when visiting active volcanoes. The Vanuatu government’s Mines and Geology Department issues notices to the Vanuatu Tourism Office and provincial councils using an activity alert scale with 6 levels from 0-5. Levels 4 and 5 indicate more dangerous activity. Contact the Vanuatu Tourism Office before travelling to the areas where volcanic activity may occure. Information on volcanic activity can also be round at the Vanuatu Geohazards Observatory.
