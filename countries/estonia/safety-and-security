Terrorism 
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.     
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Estonia
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Estonia, attacks cannot be ruled out.    
Attacks could be indiscriminate including in places visited by foreign nationals. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.
Crime
Pickpockets can be a problem in bars and nightclubs in Tallinn’s Old Town.     
Drink spiking, alcohol and sexual assault
Attacks or assault, including sexual assaults, are rare but do occur. The risk is highest late at night around popular nightlife locations. To reduce your personal risk:
save the location of your accommodation on your maps app, so it’s easier to find at the end of the night
set up a WhatsApp group to keep in touch with others in your group
keep an eye on each other’s drinks to make sure they do not get spiked
do not let a friend walk back to their hotel alone
do not give a drunk person more alcohol
Alcohol and drugs can reduce your vigilance, making you less in control. If you drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars in Estonia are often stronger than those in the UK.
Report anything that does not feel right to local authorities or hotel or club management.
Taxi safety
Always use pre-arranged taxis or official taxis with ‘TASKO’ signage. Do not accept lifts from unmarked vehicles or with strangers.
If you use an app, check that the car details match the car assigned to you. See ‘Transport risks’ for more details.
Bank card skimming
Keep cards in sight when paying in shops and restaurants. Read more about how to avoid card skimming.
Laws and cultural differences
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Do not use, buy or carry drugs – possessing even a very small quantity can lead to a prison sentence of up to 10 years.
LGBT+ travellers
Same-sex sexual activity is legal in Estonia, and same-sex marriages have been recognised since 1 January 2024.   
Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Estonia, see information on driving abroad and check the rules of the road in the RAC’s Estonia guide. The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.
You can drive in Estonia with a UK driving licence. You must have the original V5C vehicle registration document with you. Check for more details on the Estonian state portal.
Check if you need a UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK. 
Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience or a higher minimum age.  
Do not drink and drive. If you are tested and found to have more than a quarter of England’s legal limit of alcohol in your body, you may get a fine and possible imprisonment.
Taxis
Do not hail unmarked taxis – they’re illegal. Make sure the taxi has:
a price list on the back window
the driver’s licence in a visible place
a working meter
‘TASKO’ signage (for taxis at taxi ranks)
You can also use taxi apps like Bolt, Taxigo and Uber.
