This page has information on travelling to Oman.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Oman set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Oman’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
The Omani authorities have removed all COVID-19 restrictions.
Your airline may have rules in addition to those set out by the Omani authorities (e.g. requiring you to provide a negative PCR test before boarding, wearing a mask etc).
If you’re fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Oman are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
Proof of vaccination status
You don’t need to provide your vaccination status for entry to Oman.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Entry requirements for Oman are the same for all travellers, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
Entry requirements for Oman are the same for all travellers, regardless of whether you have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past year.
Children and young people
There are no specific requirements for children and young people.
If you’re transiting through Oman
Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
Check with your airline before departing.
Testing on departure
On departure you may have your temperature checked. If you show symptoms of coronavirus, you may be prevented from travelling. You must also comply with whatever the entry and testing requirements are at the country you intend to travel to.
Exemptions
There are no exemptions to Oman’s entry requirements.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
Visas
See ‘entry rules in response to coronavirus’ section.
British nationals can visit Oman without a visa if:
your stay is 14 days or less (no extensions);
you have evidence of a confirmed hotel booking
you have health insurance to cover your stay
you have a return ticket
For other types of visit, British nationals need a visa to enter Oman. Visit visas are available on arrival at the airport, however it is recommended that you apply for a visa before you travel. Applications can be made through the Royal Oman Police portal. If you are travelling as a tourist, you can apply for an unsponsored visa.
For all other visas, please follow the guidance on the portal or talk to your sponsor/employer in Oman.
Passport validity
Your passport should have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of entry to Oman.
Oman doesn’t recognise dual nationality. If you hold both British and Oman nationalities and this becomes known to the Omani authorities, they may confiscate your Omani or British passport.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Travelling with medication
Some prescribed and over the counter medicines available in the UK are banned substances in Oman. If you’re travelling to Oman with prescription drugs, carry a copy of the prescription. For further information, check with Oman’s Ministry of Health well in advance of travel.
