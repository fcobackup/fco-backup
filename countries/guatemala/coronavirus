Restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus are in place. If you are in Guatemala you should:
comply with social distancing of at least 1.5 metres

While the Guatemalan government’s mandatory curfew ended on 30 September, the system of health alerts remains in effect, with regulations on social distancing to be maintained within businesses and other public facilities based on the health alert level in each location. Each town has been assigned a colour. The colour responds to the number of positive COVID-19 cases reported, with red being the highest number of cases, amber being a high number of cases, yellow being a moderate number of cases and green being a lower number of cases. For information about the specific restrictions in the town where you are, check the Government of Guatemala website.
The list of threat rankings for each department and municipality is available on the Guatemalan government’s website.
The activities that will be permitted at each threat level are summarised on the Guatemalan government website.
You should familiarise yourself with the threat level in the area you live in and to keep up to date with any changes.
