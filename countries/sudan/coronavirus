Entry and borders
The Sudanese authorities have closed all external borders. It is no longer possible to enter Sudan by road or sea. Cargo and humanitarian flights are exempted but crew must observe strict guidelines.
On 16 March, the Sudanese Civil Aviation Authority closed all airports to international commercial passenger airlines.
We are urgently seeking guidance from the Sudanese authorities on the impact of the flight suspension on British Nationals whose visas or residency permits have expired or are due to expire. You should continue to check this travel advice and the British Embassy Facebook and Twitter pages for updates.
Local measures
The Sudanese authorities have imposed a lockdown in Khartoum state with effect from Saturday 18 April for three weeks. A nightly curfew from 6pm to 6am remains in effect throughout the rest of the country, enforced by the police and armed forces. You should observe the lock down and the curfew. An Emergency Order was signed on 12 April 2020 which implemented punishments and financial penalties for violations of the Public Safety Act in relation to actions to prevent the spread of the virus.
The lockdown means that:
All individuals must remain at home. There are exemptions for emergency and essential workers.
Public and private gatherings are banned.
The bridges across the Nile will be closed.
People may leave home between 6am and 1pm to shop for essential items in their neighbourhood.
All public departments and institutions remain closed with the exception of core institutions including security agencies, hospitals and pharmacies.
All private companies, shops and stores are closed, with the exception of bakeries, supermarkets and haulage companies.
Penalties
The Sudanese authorities are strict in enforcing restrictions on movement within Khartoum state. You should only leave home in exceptional circumstances – for example going to supermarkets or pharmacies for essential items, or to access medical care. You should comply with all local restrictions introduced by the Sudanese authorities.
Internal flights and all bus services between States have been suspended until further notice.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
