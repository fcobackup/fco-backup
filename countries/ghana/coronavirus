Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Ghana. The Ghanaian authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
As of Tuesday 17 March from 1300hrs GMT any travellers who have been to a country that has recorded at least 200 cases of coronavirus, will not be admitted into the Ghanaian jurisdiction. Airlines have been instructed not to allow such persons to embark. Border posts have been instructed not to allow such persons into the jurisdiction.
These measures would apply to travellers coming from the UK, or those who have been in the UK within the last 14 days.
Ghanaian citizens and resident permit holders are exempt from the above measures and will be allowed into the Ghanaian jurisdiction.
There will be a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine for persons who are otherwise allowed to enter the Ghanaian jurisdiction. Guidelines for self-quarantine will be available at the various Ghanaian ports of entry. Persons determined to be unable to satisfactorily self-quarantine by the Ghanaian authorities will be quarantined by the State.
Enforcement protocols are being deployed in collaboration with Ghanaian state security and health authorities.
Kotoka International Airport has put in place additional measures for screening of all arriving passengers, including a temperature check and the completion of a health declaration form which you are likely to be given after leaving the plane on arrival.
You should comply with these and any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities; if you are suspected of having COVID-19 you will be asked to undergo further checks.
We recommend you check what measures are in place again before you arrive in Ghana, either with your airline, travel company or the nearest Ghana High Commission. The Government of Ghana has also published four numbers for anyone feeling unwell (+233) 055 2222 004, 055 2222 005, 050 9497700 and 055 8439 868.
