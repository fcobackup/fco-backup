The Serbian Ministry of Health website gives up to date information on the number of cases confirmed and tests carried out in Serbia. This website also includes helpline telephone numbers.
Entry and borders
All airports in Serbia are currently closed to international passenger flights as are all borders, except for freight traffic. These measures, and those taken by neighbouring countries, mean there are now no commercial means of arriving in Serbia, or leaving Serbia to return to the UK. The Serbian Government has announced plans to re-open airports for commercial passenger flights no earlier than 18 May. Announcements on measures for international arrivals are expected in due course.
Countries neighbouring Serbia have also introduced restrictions. Please check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details. Some exemptions have been identified, including international cargo transport by road or river (time limits apply when in transit).
General advice about flights
If you have booked, or are looking to book, flights between Serbia and the UK in May, you should be aware that there is no guarantee of when the current restrictions on air travel will be lifted. We recommend that you contact your airline for the latest information.
Visas
The right to remain in Serbia for foreign nationals was extended until the end of the State of Emergency (6 May). We are awaiting further guidance on visa status for affected foreign nationals.
Local measures
There is a ban on public gatherings of more than 20 people. Social distancing at all times is encouraged.
Public transport (including inter-city transport) is gradually restarting across the country, with public transport in Belgrade resuming on 8 May. Passengers will be required to wear protective facemasks and gloves.
Most businesses, shops, parks and public places are now able to open, with shopping malls reopening from 8 May. Restaurants and cafes with outdoor seating have also reopened.
Schools and universities remain closed until further notice. Some kindergartens and day care facilities will re-open from 11 May.
There may be further restrictions to limit the spread of coronavirus. Infringements of these procedures may result in fines and/or a prison sentence. If you are currently in Serbia, check news outlets regularly for up to date information.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Serbian Embassy or Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
