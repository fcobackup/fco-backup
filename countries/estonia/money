The currency of Estonia is the euro (€).
ATMs dispense euros. The currency is easily exchangeable.
Any person entering or leaving the EU must declare the cash that they are carrying if this amounts to €10,000 or more; this includes cheques, travellers’ cheques, money orders, etc. This does not apply to anyone travelling via the EU to a non-EU country, as long as the original journey started outside the EU, nor to those travelling within the EU.
