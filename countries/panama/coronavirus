Travel in Panama
Panama is currently under a state of emergency, and a curfew is in place.
On 19 March 2020, the Panamanian Government began establishing sanitary cordons in different provinces of the country, including Panama City, with checkpoints in various locations. The Panamanian Government may change suddenly the provinces with sanitary cordons, and may introduce other restrictions on movement. These are posted on the Panamanian Ministry of Health Twitter feed.
You should avoid any unnecessary travel to and from any of the areas included in sanitary cordons. If you urgently need to travel, you will need to show ID and proof of your reason for needing to cross the checkpoint in order to pass, such as evidence of your flight out of Panama.
Local authorities may also impose similar restrictions on movement.
Transport to the airport for flights
Movement within Panama is restricted, but for those with tickets, travel to the airport for repatriation is a valid exemption.
The British Embassy can facilitate a safe passage letter in Spanish and English for the driver for use at checkpoints to and from the airport. Email the British Embassy BEPanama.CV@fco.gov.uk with your flight confirmation and the following details:
the driver’s full name
identification number (cedula)
licence plate number
make and model of the vehicle
names of British nationals travelling with you
If you are having difficulty booking transportation, the British Embassy may be able to assist.
If you are travelling from outside Panama City, you are advised to arrive in Panama City on the day before the flight, to prevent any last minute delays. See a list of hotels in Panama City that you may find helpful.
We are monitoring the situation for further departures from Panama but these are likely to be limited until the air embargo is lifted (currently scheduled for 22 July)
If local authorities need confirmation that you are in transit to the airport, please call +507-297-6550 for assistance.
Taxis, Cabify and InDriver continue to operate, as do the two transport options below. Others may be available. You should book in advance and inform the British Embassy of your arrangements, as below:
