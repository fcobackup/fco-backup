The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Hungary
Hungary has restricted entry to foreign nationals. Entry rules may change at short notice. You can find the latest announcements on the Hungarian government website (in English).
From 15 July, the Hungarian Government introduced changes to entry requirements based on the country you are arriving from; countries have been classified green, amber, or red according to the level of COVID-19 infection. Different rules apply to countries classified as green, amber or red. The full list of countries is set out in a resolution issued by the Hungarian Chief Medical Officer (available in Hungarian). The UK has been classified as amber.
Entry requirements for arrivals from ‘green’ countries (countries not listed by the resolution issued by the Hungarian Chief Medical Officer)
All arrivals to Hungary from countries classified as green may enter Hungary without any restrictions. If within 14 days you show symptoms of COVID-19, you will need to inform the Hungarian authorities.
Entry requirements for arrivals from ‘amber’ countries (currently including the UK)
All arrivals from countries classified as amber (including the UK) will have to undergo a medical examination for COVID-19.
UK nationals who on entry can present a valid permanent residence permit or any kind of permit allowing stay in Hungary for more than 90 days (e.g. registration certificate) will be treated the same as Hungarian nationals. This means that if on arrival you show no symptoms of COVID-19, you will need to self-isolate for 14 days. You can be exempted from the requirement to self-isolate if you have two negative test results for COVID-19 with a minimum of 48 hours difference between the two tests, within five days of your entry date. The results must be provided in an official document in either Hungarian or in English. You can also choose to undertake testing after you have started self-isolation. If your first test is negative, the authorities may exempt you from further self-isolation, but you are still required to take the second test. If your second test result is positive, you will be required to continue your self-isolation. If on arrival you show symptoms of COVID-19, you will need to go into government quarantine or self-isolation for 14 days.
Other UK nationals without a Hungarian residency permit will also undergo medical checks on arrival. If you show no symptoms of COVID-19, the same quarantine rules will apply as for those with a residency permit. However, if you show signs of COVID-19, entry to Hungary will be denied.
Entry requirements for arrivals from ‘red’ countries
All non-Hungarian nationals arriving from countries classified as red can enter Hungary only if they have a valid permanent residence permit or other permit allowing a stay in Hungary of more than 90 days. In this instance, you will need to follow the same quarantine rules applicable to countries classified as amber (e.g. UK). For all other foreign nationals arriving from countries classified as red, entry will be denied.
Exemptions may apply in special circumstances. If you arrive from a country classified as red and you do not have a valid Hungarian residency document, you may request an exemption by submitting an electronic application on the official website of the Hungarian Police. The form is currently only available in Hungarian and must be completed in Hungarian. The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade recommend that applications are submitted several days in advance of planned travel, clearly stating the justification for the exemption application. Examples of when an exemption might be made include for business activities, to appear in court, to take an exam, to attend a wedding/funeral/baptism of a direct family member, for a medical check-up, to care for a relative or to participate in an international sports, cultural or religious event. This is at the Police’s discretion and you must be able to provide required documentation.
Anyone granted entry to Hungary following this special application route will still need to undergo a medical check on arrival. If you show no symptoms of COVID-19, you will need to self-isolate or go in to government quarantine for 14 days. Authorities may decide to end the quarantine early if you provide two negative test results for COVID-19 48 hours apart. If on arrival you show symptoms of COVID-19, entry will be denied.
All foreign nationals transiting through Hungary must undergo a medical examination at the border and show no symptoms of COVID-19. You must be able to prove what your destination is, the reason you are travelling and that you are able to transit to your final destination. Throughout the transit you can only use specified routes, dedicated petrol and rest stations and specific border crossing points.
Testing / screening on arrival
Anyone entering Hungary from a country classified as amber or red will undergo a medical check.
Depending on the classification of your country of origin, the result of the medical check and whether you have a valid residency permit in Hungary, you either need to follow a 14-day quarantine rule or you may be denied entry. For specific rules check Entry to Hungary.

Fines
Entry into Hungary can be barred if you have failed to pay a previous fine in Hungary. Contact the Hungarian Embassy in London for guidance on paying any outstanding fines before you next enter Hungary.
Customs regulations
Community regulations ensure the free movement of goods between EU member states. This means that no customs procedures are required for exporting goods from Hungary to another EU member state and/or for importing goods from a member state to Hungary. The export and import of goods purchased for non-commercial purposes (for personal use or as gifts) while travelling is not restricted, however, the transport of certain goods (such as: pets, hunting weapons, alcohol and tobacco products, medicines containing drugs, etc.) within the European Union is restricted or subject to special permissions.
Check the customs regulations before entering or leaving Hungary on the National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary website.
