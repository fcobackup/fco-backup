If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you begin to feel any COVID-19 symptoms, take a lateral flow test (LFT). You should report positive LFT results through the Cayman Islands Government website. If you test positive, you will need to complete a confirmation PCR test at one of HSA’s testing centres.
If you are vaccinated and test positive for COVID-19, then you will need to isolate for no less than 7 days.
If you are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and test positive, you are required to isolate for a period of no less than 9 days.
There is no requirement for a person to test once they have completed isolation.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
