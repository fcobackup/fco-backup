Tropical cyclones
The Taiwanese authorities have issued sea and land typhoon warnings for Typhoon Koinu. The typhoon is expected to bring hazardous sea and weather conditions across Taiwan from 4 October 2023. You should monitor alerts issued by the Taiwan’s Central Weather Administration and follow the advice of the local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
The tropical cyclone (typhoon) season in Taiwan normally runs from May to November. There’s a risk of road blockages and landslides following typhoons, especially in central and southern Taiwan.
Listen to Typhoon Alerts on ICRT, BCC and PRS radio stations, or alternatively monitor the websites of the  Central Weather Administration, Japan Meteorological Agency, ICRT and DGPA (Announcement of Office and School Closures in Taiwan).
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about how to prepare effectively and what to do if you’re likely to be affected by a hurricane or tropical cyclone.
Check the Central Weather Administration website and the Highway Bureau website before travelling.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes do occur in Taiwan. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
