The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Guinea-Bissau
Land and sea borders have now re-opened and commercial air links have resumed.
All those entering Guinea Bissau must present a negative COVID-19 test result from an accredited institution, taken within the previous 72 hours. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You will also have to take a COVID test within 72 hours of your departure from Guinea Bissau.
You may also be required to fill in a form with information on your origin and contacts. If you display any symptoms for COVID-19 on arrival, you will be tested again, and have to remain in isolation at your place of residence until results are delivered. If someone on your flight is thought to have COVID-19, you may be required to isolate at one location for 14 days, and be monitored by the health authorities.
