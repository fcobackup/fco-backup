The rainy season in Peru runs from November to April. It can rain heavily in the Andes and there have been occasions of torrential rains in some parts of the country. See Natural disasters
Heavy rains across many regions of Peru in 2017 caused flooding, landslides and mudslides. Tumbes, Trujillo and Piura and surrounding areas in the north of Peru were particularly affected as were areas of Lima province, around the capital.
There has been extensive damage to infrastructure and reconstruction work in some areas is taking place. Some areas of the country continue to have slight transport disruption.
