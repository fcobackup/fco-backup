This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in New Caledonia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
On 12 May 2022, the French government announced that travel restrictions between France and New Caledonia would be relaxed. If you’re unvaccinated, you no longer need a compelling reason for travel or proof of a negative COVID-19 test before travel. You may still face restrictions for entry to New Caledonia depending on your vaccination status and your country of departure. You should check the status of your country of departure and relevant restrictions on the French government’s website, and the website of the New Caledonian government (in French) for details on any remaining local restrictions.  For more information on specific entry measures, you should consult the French government website and this French government COVID-19 website (in French).
