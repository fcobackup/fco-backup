You should expect to rely on cash for most of your stay (preferably US dollars). Visitors bringing in excess of $10,000 (or equivalent) in foreign currency should declare this to Customs on arrival or risk facing imprisonment.
Once in country it’s easy to exchange US dollars into Kyats and exchange rates are generally fair. Due to concerns over counterfeit money, dollars with the letters AB and CB at the start of the serial number (top left-hand corner of the note) aren’t always accepted. Notes with pen marks, folds or tears are also not accepted.
An increasing number of hotels, restaurants and shops now accept credit and debit cards, but there’s widespread distrust of electronic payment and banking. If you intend to pay for hotels or restaurants with a credit or debit card, you should phone ahead and confirm that this will be possible. Many vendors will charge a high service fee for paying by card.
ATMs are now widely available but aren’t always reliable and you should monitor your transactions regularly. Western Union operates for inward transfer of funds via Myanmar banks.
Avoid using ATMs in exposed locations – opt for ATMs in banks and shopping centres instead.
Check ATMs for skimming devices before use.
If you use ATM, debit or credit cards, closely monitor your bank transaction records.
Report any theft promptly to local police.
Carry enough cash to cover all of your expenses while in Myanmar. Credit cards are not widely accepted. Even where credit card facilities do exist, internet connections may be too slow to enable credit cards to be a reliable payment method. Traveller’s cheques are never accepted and debit cards may not work for direct purchases. It’s possible to find some internationally linked ATMs in Myanmar, but the daily withdrawal limits are low and the machines can often be out of service. Neither cash advances via credit or debit card nor cheque-cashing services are available.
