Travel in Vietnam

A partial lockdown of Da Nang has been applied from midnight 27 July. This includes staying at home, wearing masks and adhering to social distancing if there is an essential need to leave the home. Schools and public transport have been suspended. Whilst current restrictions primarily apply to Da Nang city, there will be disruption to travelling through the city to surrounding provinces (Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Thua Thien Hue).
Other cities and provinces have implemented increased measures, including requiring anyone who has recently been in Da Nang to complete health questionnaires.
