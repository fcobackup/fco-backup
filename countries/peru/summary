Political protests in Southern Peru and Lima started on 4 January. They can easily spread to other parts of the country. These protests are unpredictable and can escalate quickly and include violence. The airport of Juliaca in Puno has suspended its operations.
The Peruvian government has made a form available here to identify any visitors experiencing travel difficulties as a result of the protests. Please note this form is not managed by the British Embassy and we will not be able to contact British nationals registered in this list.
You should take particular care to avoid all areas of protests. If possible, you should remain in a safe place. You should also monitor local media, including social media channels.
Travellers arriving in Lima should be aware that travel to some parts of the country may not be possible. Protests may cause travel disruption, including with road blockades, suspension of train services and airport closures in different parts of the country. Train services to Machu Picchu have been temporarily suspended since 4 January. Travellers should recheck with their airline or tour operator and revisit travel plans ahead of any travel. For information on Lima airport operations, please visit the Lima airport website.
