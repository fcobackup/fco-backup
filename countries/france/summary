The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of France based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks. Check separate travel advice pages for overseas territories of France.

Travel to France is subject to entry restrictions
On 11 March, the French government announced it was easing restrictions on travel from the UK. From 12 March, arrivals no longer need to justify an essential reason to enter France. All other measures (such as the pre-departure testing requirement) remain in place and apply to all air, car, ferry and train passengers. For further details, please see the Entry requirements
All travellers from the UK, including children aged 11 and above, will need to present a negative COVID-19 test result (PCR only), carried out less than 72 hours before departure. Arrivals will also be required to self-isolate for 7 days upon arrival, before taking another PCR test
Arrivals from the UK will need to complete a ‘sworn statement’ (déclaration sur l’honneur) form self-certifying they are not suffering from symptoms associated with coronavirus and have not been in contact with confirmed cases in the preceding fortnight. Arrivals from the UK who have visited non-European countries within the last 14 days remain subject to the requirement to evidence a compelling reason. You should check our COVID-19 advice on things to consider, and be prepared to stay overseas longer than planned
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel. British citizens who are unable to return to the UK before the expiry of their visa/permit or the end of their visa-free limit due to COVID-19 restrictions should contact their local immigration authorities in France. Further updates will be published when they are available.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
