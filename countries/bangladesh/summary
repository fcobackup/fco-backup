Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Bangladesh. The threat extends across the country. There have been several IED attacks targeting police and security forces in Dhaka in 2019 and an IED attack against an Awami League office in Khulna city. There is a risk that future attacks could target public gatherings, including religious gatherings and political rallies, crowded areas and places where foreign nationals are known to gather. You should minimise your exposure to these areas, consider your movements carefully and follow any specific advice of the local authorities. See Terrorism
Political rallies with the potential for disorder or clashes between groups and with law enforcement agencies may take place. Following clashes between protesters and police on 20 October 2019 in which four protestors died, there is an increased law enforcement presence in the Bhola district of Barisal Division and a ban against all public gatherings there. Across Bangladesh you are advised to avoid large gatherings, including those for religious gatherings, festivals and political rallies. See Political violence
As a result of ongoing violence in Myanmar (Burma) since August 2017, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees have arrived in the south-east of Bangladesh, close to the border with Myanmar. They’re concentrated in the sub-districts of Ukhia and Teknaf in the southern part of Cox’s Bazar district. The Bangladeshi authorities regulate access to the areas where the Rohingya are accommodated. There have been reports of insecurity, protests and some violence, including civil disorder from both the local community and camp population following the murder of a local political leader, believed to have been committed by criminal gangs. Teknaf currently sees the highest level of drug related gang violence across Bangladesh, with frequent murders and shooting incidents between the gangs and law enforcement agencies. Drug seizures are common and Yaba (a mixture of caffeine and methamphetamine) is often found in very large quantities. Kidnapping and an increase in violence have also been noted in these areas, and specifically in the camps in the Teknaf area since August 2019. You should exercise caution and consult the local authorities about the latest situation before visiting Ukhia and Teknaf. We encourage all humanitarian assistance to be coordinated through recognised humanitarian agencies registered with the Bangladeshi authorities. See Myanmar border
