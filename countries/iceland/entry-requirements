The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Iceland for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Due to COVID-19 restrictions, non-essential travel by British citizens from the UK/other non EU/EEA country to Iceland is only permitted if you:
are resident in Iceland, or
can adequately demonstrate you have either been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or previously recovered from COVID-19 infection
All travellers must pre-register before arrival.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
If you have had a full course of the COVID-19 vaccine, the certificate will only be valid for travel to Iceland on or after the 15th day since your second vaccination (or from the single dose of the Janssen / Johnson and Johnson vaccine). From 26 July you will also need to present a negative PCR or antigen (rapid) test that is no more than 72 hours old before departing to Iceland.
If Border Officials have doubts over your certificate, you will be tested and face quarantine. You may be put in to a managed quarantine facility if infected with a virus strain classed as particularly high risk for contagion or morbidity.
You will be asked to provide proof of vaccination which must contain the specific COVID information Iceland requires.
Iceland will accept the UK’s solutions to demonstrate your COVID vaccination status. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Children born in 2005 or later and travelling with those who are fully vaccinated or exempt from testing and quarantine will also be exempt.
Certificates of previous infection must be a PCR test or antibody test by ELISA blood serum test and meet Iceland’s criteria.
Entry without a certificate of vaccination or previous infection
If you do not have an acceptable certificate of vaccination or of previous infection, and are not a resident of Iceland, there are only a very limited number of essential reasons for which you will be given permission to travel.
When flying into Iceland without a certificate of vaccination or previous infection you must follow these steps:
present a negative PCR taken within 72 hours of your time of departure to Iceland (or get a ISK 100,000 fine for residents or a refusal of entry for visitors)
take 2 COVID-19 tests, one on arrival and another 5 to 6 days later,
quarantine between tests, until you have the results
Full guidance can be found in English on the Iceland website.
If you are a resident, then you are strongly advised to have a C-122 residence certificate with you at the airport to avoid issues at check-in.
Children who are 16 years or older need to undergo testing at the border, quarantine for 5 days and have a second test as above unless they are fully vaccinated.
Children born in 2005 or later do not need to have a PCR test at the border and are exempt from the obligation to present a negative PCR certificate on arrival. If you are travelling with a child, and need to be quarantined, so will the child. The child will be released from quarantine if your second test on day 5-6 is negative. Children travelling alone do not need to quarantine.
Travel from high risk countries
Iceland defines certain countries as high risk for travel. You will be prohibited from entering Iceland if you are travelling from, or have recently been in, these countries and do not have an acceptable certificate of vaccination or of previous infection.
If you are resident in Iceland, or have the permission of the Icelandic Authorities to travel from, or have in the previous 14 days stayed in, these areas you may need to stay in managed quarantine facilities if you do not have a suitable place to self-isolate in Iceland. These measures will significantly affect what you can and cannot do on arrival. If you have booked a trip to Iceland you should contact your tour operator and travel insurer about what this means for you and your plans.
Data collection
Upon arrival you will be encouraged to sign up to the contact tracing app Rakning C-19. Further information, including how to download it, data usage, privacy and scope is available on the Rakning C-19 website.
Testing / screening on arrival
If you test positive on arrival you will be required to enter self-isolation (at your hotel or government-provided accommodation) unless further tests determine the infection is inactive.
You may also need to be tested again or enter self-isolation if you are exposed to a possible infection during your trip eg during the flight to Iceland.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Iceland and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Icelandic entry requirements. Check with the Icelandic Directorate of Immigration what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
if you stay in Iceland with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Iceland or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Icelandic border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are a British resident in Iceland, you are advised to obtain a letter confirming your status from Registers Iceland. Our Living in Guide contains more information.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Iceland, or any other Schengen country
less than 10 years old
The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Iceland.
