Disruption and ongoing protests
There has been significant unrest across Mozambique in recent months following national elections on 9 October 2024. The situation has improved since late December, but there remains the potential for further sporadic unrest. Road toll gates are particularly vulnerable to protests at short notice.
Protests can be violent and occur at short notice. Avoid large gatherings or demonstrations, pay attention to your surroundings and avoid travelling after dark if possible. Access to land borders could be affected, along with public services and transport. If you are in Mozambique, seek local advice and monitor the local media.
Travel insurance
If you choose to travel, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
