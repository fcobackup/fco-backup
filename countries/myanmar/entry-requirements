Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Myanmar (Burma).

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Myanmar’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Myanmar set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Myanmar Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Myanmar.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Myanmar, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the day you arrive.
Visa requirements
British nationals must apply for a visa to enter Myanmar. If you have any queries about visas or entry requirements, check with your nearest Myanmar embassy.
If you overstay your visa, you will be liable to pay a fine and could face detention.
Applying for a visa
You can apply for a tourist visa online.
To apply for a business e-visa you need to be sponsored by a registered Myanmar company or a registered Chamber of Commerce association. Submit the proof of the invitation with your visa application in the form of a letter personally addressed to you, along with a copy of the company’s registration certificate. The letter must state the purpose and timeframe of your visit.
Non-governmental organisations and international non-governmental organisations are not eligible to sponsor visas.
Vaccine requirements
To enter Myanmar, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Myanmar guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Myanmar. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
Importing unmanned aerial systems (drones) without prior permission from the authorities is potentially illegal.
Taking money into Myanmar
There is significant disruption to banking services. You may find that some ATMs are out of operation. Some bank branches may be closed, and some banks have limits to daily withdrawals. Electronic payments and transfers are mostly working, but many commercial outlets will only accept cash.
Expect to rely on cash for most of your stay. If you plan to bring more than 10,000 US dollars-worth of any foreign currency, you must declare this to customs on arrival or risk imprisonment. 
If you have to pay a visa fine or for excess baggage on departure, you will need to pay in US dollars.
Once you’re in Myanmar it can be difficult to change US dollars into kyats. Many moneychangers are closing due to pressure from the authorities. Notes are typically inspected very carefully.
Due to concerns over counterfeit money, exchange counters may refuse dollars with the letters AB and CB at the start of the serial number (top left-hand corner of the note).
Check your US dollars are in good condition, with no pen marks, folds or tears. Exchange counters prefer high-denomination bills.
If you want to pay for hotels or restaurants with a credit or debit card, phone ahead to check this will be possible.
