This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Nepal as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Nepal to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Nepal
The Government of Nepal has extended the current internal movement restrictions across the country until at least 18 May.
All outside movement, except for emergencies or to purchase essentials, is prohibited. Restrictions on movement may be strictly enforced, with reports that police are detaining people who are judged to be undertaking non-essential movements. Anyone who defies this order could face a jail sentence and/or a fine
Permissions for mountaineering expeditions for Spring 2020 (including existing permissions) have been suspended
Nepali media reports that some stores are open in the early mornings or evenings, though this may vary by location.
There have been reports of some incidents in parts of Nepal of foreign tourists being threatened or intimidated by locals, allegedly in relation to coronavirus. Such incidents are rare, although have increased in recent days. If you experience such problems, return immediately to your accommodation (if safe), or to the local law enforcement agencies (phone 100), or contact the British Embassy at +977 (0)1 423 7100.
For information on entering Nepal, see Entry Requirements.
Accommodation
If you are safe where you are, stay there except for essential movements, such as for food or medical reasons, unless you are seeking to return to Kathmandu in order to leave.
If you cannot stay where you are, email the British Embassy via BEKathmandu@fco.gov.uk with details of your name, nationality, passport number and location.
Health
Make sure you have sufficient medicine, if required. The British Embassy has a list of pharmacies and hospitals that dispense in Kathmandu.
For contact details for English speaking doctors visit our list of healthcare providers.
Testing and isolation for COVID-19 is limited to certain Government hospitals, where services are basic. View Health for further details on healthcare in Nepal.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Nepal, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
