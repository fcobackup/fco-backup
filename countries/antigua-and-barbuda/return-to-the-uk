Future options
The British High Commission St John’s is in contact with airlines, the Antigua and Barbuda authorities and other governments to make sure commercial options for returning to the UK are available as soon as possible. British Airways’ current schedule has direct flights to the UK resuming on 1 August; Virgin Atlantic have advised their schedule will resume in October.
This travel advice will be updated when departure options become available. Sign up for travel advice email alerts and follow the British High Commission on Twitter and Facebook.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
