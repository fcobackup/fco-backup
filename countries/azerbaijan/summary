The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is advising British nationals against all non-essential international travel at this time. Existing advice for Azerbaijan remains in place:
The FCO advise against all travel to:
Nagorno-Karabakh and the military occupied area surrounding it
within 5km of the Line of Contact
within 5km of the border with Armenia.
The Azerbaijani Government has introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of coronavirus.
The authorities have extended the quarantine regime in Azerbaijan to 1 August with significant restrictions in place until 6am on 5 July 2020. See Staying during coronavirus.
As of 2 July, Azerbaijan Airlines (AZAL) and Turkish Airlines will run commercial flights four times a week between Baku and Istanbul. Turkish Airlines flights between London and Istanbul are also operating. See Return to the UK and Staying during coronavirus. Before travelling check the travel advice for Turkey and any other countries you are travelling via for the entry requirements and transiting rules.
All passengers travelling to or from Azerbaijan will require a negative COVID-19 test. The test itself can be taken more than 48 hours before your flight but the certificate showing the negative test result will only be accepted if issued within 48 hours before the flight. You should seek to have your test results via email and printed off, or a paper certificate. See Entry requirements
If you are a resident or visitor travelling to the UK you will need to self-isolate for 14 days. You must provide your journey and contact details and not leave the place you are staying for the first 14 days except in very limited circumstances. You can find more information here. There are limited exemptions, details of which can be found here. See Return to the UK
Around 30,000 British nationals visit Azerbaijan every year, mainly on business. Most visits are trouble free.
All British nationals travelling to Azerbaijan must get a visa in advance. The Azerbaijani authorities have announced from 13 March the ASAN Visa service (e-visas) are temporarily suspended. E-visas issued before the suspension of the service but which have not yet been used for entry in to Azerbaijan have been annulled. See Safety and Security
Consular support is not available in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh continue. There are regular ceasefire violations along the Line of Contact separating the opposing forces and elsewhere on the inter-state border between Azerbaijan and Armenia periodically resulting in deaths and casualties. Anyone who has visited Nagorno-Karabakh without the permission of the Azerbaijani authorities will be refused entry to Azerbaijan. See Local travel
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Azerbaijan. See Terrorism
If youâ€™re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Given the rapidly changing situation, we have temporarily withdrawn a limited number of UK staff and dependants from our Embassy. The Embassy continues to carry out essential work, including providing 24/7 consular assistance and support to British people in Azerbaijan.
Take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance, including cover for medical evacuation, before you travel.
