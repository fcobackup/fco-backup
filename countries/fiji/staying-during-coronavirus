This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Fiji as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Fiji to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Registering with the British High Commission
If you are a UK/EU national seeking to leave Fiji to return home, send your details to SuvaCS@fco.gov.uk with the following information for all passengers:
full name as it appears on passport
passport number
nationality
date of birth
current location
telephone numbers if you have one
intended destination
In registering your details, you will receive regular information about the situation in Fiji, including if any further flights become available.
Moving around in Fiji
From 3 April, the capital city of Suva entered lockdown, following new cases in the city. No members of the public are able to leave or enter the city for 14 days, except to access medical care. Many businesses, except those offering essential services, will remain closed.
There is a national curfew in place from 8pm to 5am.
There are also some measures to limit internal travel. This includes the suspension of all passenger travel to Fiji’s outer islands from 29 March. If you’re visiting outer islands, you’re advised to return to the main island of Viti Levu immediately. If you remain in the outer islands there is no guarantee you will be able to leave for some time. Broader travel restrictions could be introduced at little or no notice. More information on the latest restrictions are available on the Fiji Government website.
