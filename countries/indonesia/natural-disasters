Indonesia sits along a volatile seismic strip called the ‘Ring of Fire’ in the Pacific. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur regularly, which can present a potential threat of tsunamis. The capacity of the Indonesian emergency and rescue services to deal with large natural disasters is limited.
Earthquakes and tsunamis
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
If a major earthquake or landslide occurs close to shore, you should follow the instructions of local authorities, bearing in mind that a tsunami could arrive within minutes. The Indonesia Tsunami Early Warning Centre issues tsunami warnings when a potential tsunami with significant impact is imminent or expected.
Volcanoes
There are many active volcanoes in Indonesia, any of which can erupt without warning resulting in the evacuation of villages within a 3 to 7 kilometre radius. In the past, repeated eruptions have caused destruction and fatalities. Check media reports before travelling to areas that are prone to volcanic activity. Take extra care and follow the advice of the local authorities, including respecting any exclusion zones.
During previous eruptions, areas beyond local exclusion zones have been affected by mud/debris flows (particularly in valleys) and volcanic ash falls. While near any volcano, you should therefore monitor local media, exercise caution and follow the advice of the local authorities, including any evacuation orders.
Ash clouds can affect flight schedules and the operation of regional airports. Check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
If you’re travelling to areas of Indonesia where volcanic activity is ongoing, you should be aware that ash plumes can affect air quality and have an impact on health. Public Health England (PHE) advise that a properly fitted face mask may provide some protection. While masks should be available in Indonesia, you may choose to buy your own before you travel. PHE recommend masks that comply with EU standards P2 or P3 or the US standards N95 or N98. You should make sure that your mask fits your face and you know how to wear it properly.
If you have any pre-existing respiratory conditions, such as asthma, be aware that you might be at increased risk of triggering or worsening your symptoms. Make sure you travel with sufficient supplies of any regular medicines to cater for this.
In the event of a major eruption, areas outside of exclusion zones may be subject to increased levels of particulate and gaseous pollutants in the air. Face masks only offer protection against small particulate matter; they do not protect against hazardous gases emitted by a volcano. Unless you’re advised to evacuate the area you’re in, the best way to reduce your exposure is to remain inside and close all doors and windows. Following eruptions in 2017 and 2018, some volcanoes continue to show signs of increased volcanic activity.
Mount Agung, Bali
On 28 June 2018 Mount Agung in East Bali erupted, emitting gas and ash which resulted in the closure of Bali’s airport and a number of nearby regional airports for a period of time. Indonesia uses four volcano alert levels to activate community mitigation planning. These are 1. Normal, 2. Advisory (Waspada), 3. Watch (Siaga) and 4. Warning (Awas) The alert level for Mount Agung has now returned to level 1, but climbers are recommended to limit activity around the crater. The alert level is subject to change at short notice.
Travellers to Bali may find information on travel during the volcanic activity useful.
Eruptions in late 2017 and June 2018 led to periodic closures at Bali and Lombok airports and disruption to flights in the region. Further disruption can not be ruled out. The local authorities have indicated that Mount Agung continues to show signs of volcanic activity and the possibility of volcanic eruptions remains.
Mount Semeru, East Java
The FCDO advise against all travel to within 5km of the crater of Mount Semeru in Lumajang Regency, East Java. The FCDO also advise against travel to the southeast area of Mount Semeru along the Besuk Kobokan river, approximately 13km from the crater, and 500m from any Besuk Kobokan riverbank. These are exclusion zones put into place by the local authorities.
Mount Semeru erupted on 4 December 2022, emitting a 1,500 meters (4,921 ft) high ash cloud. Indonesian authorities have set an alert status of level 4 (of 4) and are warning of the potential for pyroclastic flows and lava flows along rivers, tributaries and valleys around Mount Semeru, especially along Besuk Kobokan, Besuk Bang, Besuk Kembar and Besuk Sat.
Mount Sinabung, North Sumatra
The FCDO advise against all travel to within 5km of the crater of Mount Sinabung in Kalo Regency, North Sumatra. This is an exclusion zone put into place by the local authorities.
Mount Sinabung erupted on the 28 July 2021, sending a large column of smoke and ash 4,500 meters (14,760 ft) into the sky. It also generated pyroclastic flows that travelled down the eastern and southeastern flank for about 1000 m. The Indonesian authorities have set an alert status of level 3 (of 4). If there is ash rain, people are advised to wear masks to reduce its health impact.
Floods
The Indonesian rainy season runs from September – January, but can run into February. You should monitor international / local weather reporting if travelling during rainy season.
Large areas of the country, including parts of West Sumatra, Central, East and West Java and Jakarta have been severely affected by heavy rains and subsequent landslides and flooding in recent years. Throughout Indonesia flash floods and more widespread flooding can occur. Cities - especially Jakarta - can suffer severe localised flooding which can result in major traffic congestion and power outages. The main toll road to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport and other major roads in Jakarta can be affected by flooding. Slips and landslides occur in mountainous and remote areas, but also in urban areas.
Take care when driving and walking. Keep a stock of bottled water and make sure your phone is charged.
