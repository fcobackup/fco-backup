Visas
All British passport holders need a tourist or business visa to enter Tanzania. Tanzania has introduced an ‘e-visas’ system through which applications can be submitted and approved online in advance of travel. It is no longer possible to get a visa from the Tanzanian High Commission in London.
It is also possible to get a tourist or business visa for a single entry on arrival at main ports of entry to Tanzania, subject to the fulfilment of all immigration requirements. You may be asked to provide proof of your return journey. You will not be able to get a multiple entry visa on arrival. For further information about visas visit the Tanzanian immigration website.
If you are planning to work or volunteer, you will need a valid work permit which can also be applied for online via the Tanzanian immigration website. Your employer or volunteer organisation should arrange this before you travel.
If you overstay the validity of your visa or permit you can be arrested, detained and fined before being deported. Reports made to the British High Commission by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) British passport holders have indicated that they are experiencing additional levels of harassment from immigration officials. In these circumstances, you should stay calm and request that the Consular section of the British High Commission is immediately informed.
