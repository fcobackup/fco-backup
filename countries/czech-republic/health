Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 112 and ask for an ambulance.
Contact your insurance or medical assistance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Health insurance cards
To get medically necessary state healthcare in the Czech Republic, you need a Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).
The NHS’s getting healthcare abroad webpage has details about:  
how to apply for a GHIC
how to get temporary cover if you lose your card or it does not arrive in time
who qualifies for a new EHIC instead of a GHIC
what treatment counts as medically necessary
A GHIC or EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. You may have costs your GHIC or EHIC does not cover, including:  
changes to travel and accommodation bookings
additional standard costs for treatment
medical repatriation to the UK
treatment that is ruled non-urgent
private healthcare
private clinics
