This page has information on travelling to Uganda. Check what you must do to return to the UK.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Uganda set and enforce entry rules.
All travellers
You’ll need a visa to enter Uganda. Following an announcement by the Ugandan Ministry of Internal Affairs on October 14 2021, you are required to have a visa before your trip. Visas will not be issued on arrival.
See the Visas section for more information.
Passengers arriving at Entebbe International Airport are required to provide a negative COVID-19 test certificate issued no more than 72 hours before boarding the aircraft to Uganda. Foreign nationals without a valid negative test certificate will be denied entry. Children aged three and under are exempt when accompanying parents arrive with a negative test certificate.
A negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate is no longer required for fully vaccinated travellers crossing into Uganda through land border points.
The requirement for all travellers to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test on arrival at Entebbe airport was suspended on16 February 2022.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. Some airlines have refused to allow passengers who have used NHS tests to travel. You should arrange to take a private test.
Arriving passengers will be subject to temperature checks and will be screened for infectious diseases by the Port Health authorities. If your temperature is above normal or you display COVID-19 symptoms you may be required to take a COVID-19 test. If a foreign national tests positive for COVID-19 and wishes to be repatriated for treatment outside of Uganda, they will be expected to cover the costs themselves.
Departing passengers are required to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test certificate, issued no more than 72 hours before travel. The 72 hours begins on the day the sample is collected for testing. Children aged three and under are exempt when accompanying parents have a negative test certificate. Passengers who have received a positive COVID-19 PCR test within 7 days of travel will not be permitted to travel.
COVID-19 tests taken for the purpose of travel outside of Uganda have to be paid for, even if the test is taken at a government testing centre. All COVID-19 test certificates issued in Uganda must indicate the intended purpose of the test. Only test certificates which state travel as the intended purpose will be valid for departure from Uganda. Test certificates which state contact or alert will not be valid for travel.
There are a number of public and private COVID-19 test centres in Uganda. For further information, please see the government COVID-19 Response website.
Departing passengers will be required to wear a face mask inside the terminal and will be subject to temperature checks. Social distancing will also be in place and only passengers with valid tickets and airport officials will be allowed into the terminal building. Passengers are advised to arrive at the airport at least 4 hours before departure.
For more information about entry requirements, visit the Ugandan Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control website.
