Hurricane Ian has caused extensive destruction and flooding across Western and Central Florida.  Power is out for large swathes of the State and mobile phone and internet coverage is unreliable.  US emergency teams from across the State are deployed across the worst affected areas to restore power, water, and mobile phone coverage.  Search and Rescue teams are also supporting people caught up in the hurricane and offering medical aid, but they have a large area to cover.  Make yourself known to the rescue teams as and when they reach you.
You should continue to monitor local radio and media updates from the US authorities and US National Hurricane Center.
