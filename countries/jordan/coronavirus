Entry restrictions
Commercial flights in and out of Jordan are suspended and all land and sea borders are closed.

Local measures
Since 20 March the Government of Jordan has introduced and enforced measures to tackle the spread of COVID-19. Measures are regularly reviewed and updated. Please follow the instructions of the local authorities.
Under current measures you are able to leave your accommodation between 10.00 and 18.00 for essential purposes only (for example, to visit a grocery store or pharmacy). You must ensure that you have returned to your accommodation by 18.00. A curfew siren will be sounded at 18.00 every day after which point you must not leave your property. Be aware that stricter curfews may be announced in the future. While the atmosphere is fairly calm on the streets, with the curfew generally well adhered to, there have been a number of arrests and vehicles impounded for violations
A very narrow exception has been authorised by the Prime Minister for those whose work is necessary to keep the country running.
The Jordanian Armed Forces announced that the military will be spread out across the entire country at the entry and exit points of large towns and cities, with tighter restrictions in Irbid.
Small grocery shops and pharmacies are open during the curfew. Operating hours are 10 am – 6 pm. Social distancing is the responsibility of the local shop and the public are only able to visit on foot. No cars will be allowed except those with official authorisation. Only those aged 16 – 60 are allowed to visit local shops. Hypermarkets and larger supermarkets are closed to the public, focusing instead on home delivery services. Online orders are being accepted.
Banks are open between 1000 – 1400 daily. ATM machines will remain available and continue to be refilled.
All health sector visits and operations have been stopped except for critical or life threatening cases. For medical emergencies, you must call the emergency services on 911 before trying to get to a hospital.
