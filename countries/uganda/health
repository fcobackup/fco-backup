Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Uganda.

Before you travel check that:
your destination can provide the healthcare you may need
you have appropriate travel insurance for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation
This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.
Emergency medical number
Dial 999 and ask for an ambulance.
Medical help at the scene of an accident is likely to be limited, particularly outside Kampala.
Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.

Health risks
Ebola
There are occasional outbreaks of Ebola in Uganda. The authorities and the World Health Organisation declared the last one was over in January 2023. See more information on Ebola and similar diseases.  
Some countries have heightened health screening for travellers from Uganda. Check the entry requirements of the country you are travelling to or transiting.
Public Health England has guidance for humanitarian or healthcare workers travelling to countries at risk of Ebola.
See the TravelHealthPro Uganda guide for more details about health risks.
Drinking water
Only use boiled or bottled water, and avoid ice in drinks. Avoid eating food prepared by unlicensed vendors or where you have concerns about kitchen hygiene.
If you are staying in Uganda for a long time, store basic provisions (drinking water and non-perishable foods) at your accommodation, in case of supply problems.
HIV and AIDS
UNAIDS estimate that around 1,400,000 adults aged 15 or over in Uganda are living with HIV. Read more about precautions and how to avoid exposure to HIV or AIDS.
Medication
Laws and rules about medicines you can buy or get on prescription in the UK can be different in other countries.
Read best practice when travelling with medicines on TravelHealthPro.
The NHS has information on whether you can take your medicine abroad.
Healthcare facilities in Uganda
Medical facilities in Uganda are limited, especially outside Kampala. Many popular tourist attractions have poor medical facilities. If you are seriously ill or have an accident, you may need an air ambulance. Make sure you have accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.
