Healthcare in Barbados
The Barbados healthcare system is not as extensive as the UK. Queen Elizabeth Hospital can cope with many types of treatment, but serious cases may need emergency evacuation. You can call the hospital helpline to speak with a healthcare professional.
Medical treatment in Barbados can be expensive. Check private clinics’ prepayment policies, as they may not accept medical travel insurance as payment.
