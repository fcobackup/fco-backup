Crime
There have been reports of petty theft and robbery. Beware of pickpockets, avoid unlit streets and parks at night, and be extra vigilant if you’re walking alone. Take extra care of your belongings in busy locations and on public transport. Don’t leave coats and handbags unattended in bars, pubs and clubs.
A small number of tourists have reported incidents on public transport and around the train station area of Vilnius where they have been approached by small groups of people asking for money or help. Be vigilant in these areas.
Don’t leave drinks unattended and be wary of accepting food and drink from strangers in bars, nightclubs and restaurants.
Car theft is a problem in certain areas. Lock unattended vehicles and hide contents. Use guarded car parks in cities, especially overnight.
 
There have been a number of thefts of bicycles in Vilnius.
In an emergency or if you wish to report a crime, call the police on 112.
Local travel
Public transport
On local buses and trolley-buses, remember to activate your ticket (whether it’s pre-purchased or bought from the driver) on the machine on board or you may be fined by undercover inspectors.
Taxis are reasonably priced. Make sure the meter is used. It is cheaper and safer to phone for a taxi from a recognised company than to hail one in the street. Ask your hotel reception to call one. Do not use unregistered taxis.
Klaipeda, Nida and Palanga
If you intend to walk along the Curonian Spit be aware that after a short distance the Spit forms part of Kaliningrad, which is a territory of the Russian Federation.
