The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises British Nationals to leave the country by commercial means, unless there is an urgent need to stay. See Return to UK.
As of 1 February, the Myanmar military have declared a state of emergency and assumed control. Figures in the Civilian Government, civil society and a foreign national have been detained by the military. Political tension and unrest are widespread since the military takeover and levels of violence are rising. The military has ordered a nightly internet shutdown, various internet platforms have been blocked and reports of disruptions to wider internet and phone networks are widespread. Access to money has become increasingly difficult with banks shut and ATMs not working. There is a nationwide curfew imposed between 8pm and 4am until further notice. If you are not able to leave Myanmar at this time, you are advised to stay home and stay safe. If you need to leave home for essential reasons, you should do so quickly, avoiding crowds.
If you’re in Myanmar and you need consular assistance, call one of the following numbers:
+95 (0)1 370863
+95 (0)1 370864
+95 (0)1 370865
+95 (0)1 370867
There may be disruptions to local phone networks. If you are unable to get through to the Embassy on any of these numbers, call +44 020 7008 1500. Please note that this is an international number and you may be charged a different rate. During the current crisis we are also asking British Nationals to email us their details so that we are aware of their presence in Myanmar. You should email Yangon.Consular@fcdo.gov.uk
The military have extended the suspension of normal commercial passenger flights until 31 May 2021. However, the airport is open and some ‘relief’ flights are available for those seeking to leave Myanmar. Most of these are commercially bookable. See Flights for more information on options for leaving Myanmar. Land borders are closed.
The Visa Application Centre in Yangon is temporarily closed. Those British Nationals looking to return to the UK urgently with family members who require a visa to enter the UK, should contact YangonBritfamilyvisas@fcdo.gov.uk for initial advice. See Return to the UK.
If you wish to return to the UK from Myanmar, you should check what you need to do before leaving to meet UK entry requirements. You should be aware of current UK entry requirements. To enter the UK, you are currently required to:
complete a passenger locator form; and
provide proof of a negative coronavirus test.
You are normally required to show proof of a negative coronavirus test to your airline before being allowed to board.
However, as of 21 February, you do not need to take a test if you began your journey to the UK from Myanmar. The present situation in Myanmar means that it is not reasonable to seek to obtain a pre-departure coronavirus test in that country before departure to the UK. The guidance will be reviewed regularly. Sign up to get an email alert whenever this page is updated. Passengers travelling to the UK can request a letter from the British Embassy Yangon, outlining the UK position on pre-departure coronavirus tests. You should send full details of name, passport number and confirmed flight details to Yangon.Consular@fcdo.gov.uk with ‘Pre-departure Test Letter Request’ in the subject line.
You should note that you are advised against all but essential travel to Myanmar. If you are considering travelling to Myanmar, or planning to re-enter Myanmar, please note the following entry restrictions for Myanmar:
Residents of the United Kingdom, or those who have visited the United Kingdom within the previous 14 days, are currently unable to enter Myanmar.
Arrivals must comply with Myanmar’s COVID-19 quarantine requirements.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel, and find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the Coronavirus section.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO guidance on foreign travel insurance.
For information about COVID-19 vaccines, see the Coronavirus page.
Take particular care in the border areas with China, Thailand, Bangladesh, India and Laos. The security situation in border areas is often volatile. Border areas have been particularly affected by military activity, ethnic militias, armed drug smugglers and the presence of landmines. There is ongoing conflict in the north of Shan State, Southern Chin, Kachin, Karen/Kayin and northern and central Rakhine states. In these areas, travellers should be prepared for a high armed, military and police presence including passing through checkpoints. There remains the possibility of violent clashes in other border areas. See Border areas
Political tension and unrest is widespread since the military takeover. You should avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings. Potential protest locations may include Sule Pagoda/City Hall, Hledan Junction/Insein, Myanmar Central Bank/Myanmar Plaza, (sometimes Embassies and UN offices) and often at Government offices, but you are advised that protests may spring up unexpectedly in other locations. Do not take photographs or videos of the police, demonstrations, military installations or military personnel. There is an increased security presence in Naypyitaw, Yangon and other areas. Protests may disrupt traffic and public transport, commercial activity and you should follow the news for your area, and avoid large crowds. See Political situation
Terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Myanmar. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities. See Terrorism
UK health authorities have classified Myanmar as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
Urban areas, particularly Yangon and Mandalay, can experience poor air quality. See Health
The banking sector is seeing widespread disruption with many banks closed and ATMs empty. Electronic payments continue to function within the country. See Money
If you need to contact local emergency services, call 199 for police, 192 for medical assistance and 191 for the fire service. You should be aware that phone operators may not speak English. Tourist Police outposts are available in Yangon, Bagan and Mandalay with English speaking officers. You can only visit these posts in person and they are not contactable by phone. Their services may be affected by COVID-19 measures.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission. We continue to operate a consular service. However, the ability of the British Embassy to provide face-to-face assistance within Myanmar is currently extremely limited, and the majority of Yangon is currently under a stay at home order. Consular support is also difficult in parts of Myanmar where embassy officials need travel permission from the Myanmar government. Permission is not guaranteed, so the British Embassy’s ability to deliver consular assistance, including in an emergency, may be restricted or delayed in these areas. If you’re arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the British Embassy immediately.
If you’re resident in Myanmar or planning to stay for a longer period, you can find advice on our Living in Myanmar guide.
The Overseas Business Risk service offers information and advice for British companies operating overseas on how to manage political, economic, and business security-related risks.
