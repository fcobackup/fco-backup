The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise that British nationals that wish to leave Denmark contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
There are limited commercial means of leaving Denmark to return to the UK by air. From 21 March until at least 4 April, there will be no commercial flights to and from Greenland. The commercial air service to the Faroe Islands has been severely reduced, with only one daily service to and from Copenhagen.
Please contact your airline directly for more information on how your travel plans may be affected and the steps you should take. British nationals in Denmark should follow the advice of the Danish authorities. See Coronavirus.
