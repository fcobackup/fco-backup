Terrorists are likely to try and carry out attacks in Tajikistan.
On 6 November 2019, it was reported that 17 people were killed in an armed attack on a Tajik security checkpoint in Rudaki District on the Tajik/Uzbek border, approximately 60km south-west of Dushanbe. The Tajik Government has said that Daesh/ISIS is responsible. Dushanbe remains calm, and there is no special police presence on the streets or at checkpoints. You should exercise caution and vigilance, particularly if travelling near or across the Tajik/Uzbek border. See Local travel and Terrorism.
On 29 July 2018, 4 tourists were killed in a deliberate attack while cycling in the south of the country. You should exercise extreme caution and vigilance, particularly if hiking or cycling in the countryside. See Terrorism.
There are regular clashes between the Taliban and Afghan government forces in north-east Afghanistan close to the border with Tajikistan. This border is also used by drug smugglers who often engage in armed clashes with Tajik security forces.
Check local advice before travelling to the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast in the East, as the area may be closed to visitors at short notice. Tensions in the regional capital, Khorog, have risen since September 2018. See Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast.
There are occasional skirmishes along the disputed Tajik/Kyrgyz border. See Border areas.
Tourism, health and transport infrastructure is poor and travel requires careful planning. See Local travel
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
