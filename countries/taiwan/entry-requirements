Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Taiwan
Since 1 January 2021, foreign nationals are not permitted to enter Taiwan. The local authorities have confirmed that resident visa holders, diplomats, foreign students, business passengers with special entry permits and spouses and children of Taiwanese nationals are exempt from this restriction. Please refer to your local Taipei Representative Office for further information regarding obtaining travel exemption permissions.
In addition, all direct passenger flights between Taiwan and the UK have been suspended until at least the end of February. We encourage any passengers to contact their airline if they believe they may be impacted and to monitor advice provided by the local authorities.
All passengers arriving directly from the UK, or those who have been in the UK in the previous 14 days, are required to have a PCR test upon arrival in Taiwan. If the test result is negative, they are then required to complete their mandatory 14 day quarantine at a designated quarantine centre. A positive test will mean hospitalisation. This applies to all nationalities and is irrespective of the purpose of travel. Upon completion of this 14 day quarantine, all passengers are required to provide a negative COVID-19 test before they are allowed to leave quarantine. An additional 7 day self-health management period is then required.
The Taiwanese authorities have provided the following information about the quarantine centres:
Quarantine centres are designated locations selected by the Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC). Designated locations include: Government owned facilities, student dorms and hotels. There are currently a total of 29 quarantine centres located across northern, central and southern Taiwan
Upon arrival in Taiwan, transportation will be arranged by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
Costs for travellers in the UK programme will be paid for by the Taiwan authorities
All travellers in the UK programme will be transferred to a Quarantine Centre designated by the CECC, and will not be able to request a specific location or room
Quarantine centres provide 3 meals per day. Meals will be delivered to people’s rooms and consumed there
You will not be allowed to leave your room or go into another individual’s room during this period. In a case of an emergency, all individuals must follow the instructions provided by the quarantine centre
In principle, only 1 person is allowed per room. For young children under the age of 12, and individuals who may require health and medical care, one family member would be allowed to stay in the same room with this individual; however, masks must be worn at all times. Requests for exemptions will be reviewed by the quarantine centre in question
Relatives are not allowed to have physical contact with any individual during quarantine; however, they would be able to deliver packages to the individual by handing this to the reception staff at the quarantine centre. This would then be passed to the individual
Due to safety concerns the following items are not accepted: fresh products including fruit and vegetables, high power-consuming electronic appliances and other dangerous items such as lighters and knifes. Alcohol consumption and smoking is prohibited in the quarantine centre
Room facilities: all rooms are equipped with Wi-Fi, a kettle and a television
Pre-travel arrangements: due to it currently being winter in Taiwan, all passengers should ensure that they prepare sufficient warm clothing and personal belongings before departure
If you have any questions regarding the quarantine centres, contact the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
The local authorities have announced that from 15 January 2021, there will be tightened quarantine measures in Taiwan, and group quarantine facilities will now be available for passengers travelling from low-risk countries. Passengers who are eligible and choose to quarantine at a private residence rather than a quarantine hotel or a group quarantine facility will be required to declare that their residence complies with quarantine requirements. You should refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for further information.
From 1 December 2020 to 28 February 2021 all passengers, regardless of nationality or travel purpose, arriving or transiting in Taiwan are required to present a certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test in order to be able to board their flight to Taiwan. Any exemption due to exceptional circumstances will require prior approval before departure.
The test needs to have taken place within three working days before their date of departure. Test Certificates of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR must be issued by a recognised medical institution in the country of departure and include the following information: the passenger’s full name as per their passport, the date of birth or passport number of the traveller, specimen collection date and test report date, the virus name, testing method and the test result. Test Certificates are required to be produced in either English or Chinese; however, in situations where the passenger provides a certificate in either French or Spanish, if the certificate is in the official language of the place of departure, and ground personnel of the airline are able to assist with the inspection of the content, the certificate may be accepted.
Anyone found to provide false or incorrect test results, or evade or obstruct the quarantine measures, may face a fine of between NT$10,000 to NT$150,000 and further criminal charges.
Refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control for further information regarding Test Exemptions, Test Certificates and COVID-19 test requirements.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
If you already hold a valid Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) or Alien Permanent Resident Certificate (APRC), you do not require a visa to enter Taiwan. For more information, you should visit the website of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC). If you are in Taiwan you can also contact the ‘Information For Foreigners In Taiwan’ helpline on 0800-024-111.

Entry procedures are being regularly reviewed, so may change at short notice.
The Taiwanese authorities announced in March that travellers already in Taiwan who arrived under a visa waiver, visitor visa or landing visa before 21 March, and had not overstayed their entry conditions, would be granted an automatic 30-day extension of their stay. This has now been extended by further 30 day periods. The extension will be applied automatically, no application is required. Your total period of stay, including extensions, cannot exceed 420 days (comprised of 180 days on a visitor visa, plus eight automatic 30 day extensions). For more information, you should contact the National Immigration Agency (NIA).
If you arrived after 21 March 2020, your maximum stay is determined by your visa. If you wish to stay over 180 days, you may apply to do so if you have a legitimate reason for needing to remain in Taiwan or are unable to leave. Restrictions apply and not all British nationals will be eligible. You cannot apply more than 15 days before the 180 day point. For more information, you should contact the National Immigration Agency (NIA). The British Office is unable to issue letters or endorsements to support any application to remain.
