Borders remain open for departure. Commercial flights to return to the UK are available.
UK special flights
The UK operated two special flights from Argentina to help British travellers most at risk from the effects of COVID-19 to return to the UK. The flights departed on 7 and 12 May. There are currently no further UK special flights from Argentina.
Commercial flights
The Argentine government has suspended, until midnight on 8 January, all direct flights between Argentina and: the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Australia, and Denmark. Travellers should consult their airline or tour operator if they have booked travel.
Every month the Argentine authorities approve a certain number of exceptional international commercial flights.
There is a limited number of indirect flights which can be used to connect with the UK. Check with your airline or travel company for the latest information. You should also check the travel advice for the countries you will be transiting.
Travelling to the airport
You can travel from your accommodation to the airport if you have a valid plane ticket and are not showing any symptoms of coronavirus.
You are only allowed to arrive at the airport within 5 hours of your flight departing.
You need to complete an electronic ‘sworn statement’ form within 48 hours of leaving, self-certifying that you are not suffering from symptoms associated with coronavirus and that you have not been in contact with confirmed cases in the preceding fortnight.
You will need a valid permit to circulate, known as a “Certificado Único de Circulación”. Non-resident foreign nationals will have to fill in the form confirming you are not an Argentine ID (DNI) holder, the reason for travel “Traslado hacia pasos fronterizos terrestres, puertos, y aeropuertos habilitados (egresos)” and fill in the “Observation” box with full details of your confirmed international flight. Once the form has been fully completed you will have to allow approximately 2 hours before entering the site again to download or print you permit which you must carry with you at all times. Each province might have additional requirements to enter or transit.
You no longer require any further documentation issued by the British Embassy in order to leave Argentina.
