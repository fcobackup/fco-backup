Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to Lebanon.

This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK who choose to travel against FCDO advice. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Lebanon’s current rules for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Lebanon set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Lebanese Embassy in the UK.
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Lebanon. 
Passport validity requirements
Your passport should be valid for at least 3 months from the date you enter Lebanon.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document, or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Checks at border control
If your passport contains an Israeli stamp, you may be refused entry to Lebanon even if you hold a valid Lebanese visa. 
Visa requirements
British citizens can normally apply for a free single-entry tourist or family visit visa on arrival at Beirut airport. A tourist visa is valid for one month from the date of entry. Travellers can extend their visa for up to three months at the General Security offices.
British citizens can also obtain a visa from the Lebanese Embassy in London. These may be valid for a different time period. In April 2024, Lebanese authorities introduced new increased rates for residence permits of foreign nationals. Travellers should make sure they understand their visa validity to avoid any penalties for overstaying.
Travellers overstaying their visa may have to pay a fine at the airport. Only Lebanese currency (pounds) will be accepted for payment. This should be paid at departures before security procedures.
British overseas citizens and British protected persons will need to get a visa before travelling to Lebanon.
Persons of Palestinian origin may also need a visa before travelling, or to carry additional documentation with them when travelling.
Entry requirements may change at short notice. Check with the Lebanese Embassy in the UK before you travel.
Name checks against offender database
Lebanese immigration authorities check all visitors’ names on arrival against a database of those wanted for, or convicted of, offences in Lebanon. If your name matches an entry on the database, you may be detained (or occasionally allowed entry by surrendering your passport) until they can be satisfied that the record does not relate to you. You might be able to do this by producing a copy of a birth certificate or other official documentation that allows parents’ names to be checked against the database. Consider carrying this kind of supporting documentation.
Vaccine requirements
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Lebanon guide.
