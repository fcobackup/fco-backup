Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

There are severe penalties for drug trafficking (10-20 years) and drug use (8-15 years). Guatemalan prisons are overcrowded, violent and unclean.
Don’t take photographs without permission, especially of children. This is particularly important in more remote areas such as Quiché, Petén, San Marcos and Chiquimula provinces. There have been lynchings related to accusations and fears of child kidnapping for adoption or theft of vital organs. Foreigners have been caught up in the violence. You may be asked to pay a small amount of money to take photographs of both children and adults.
Homosexuality is not illegal, although there are currently no provisions in Guatemalan legislation guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. There is no recognition of same-sex marriages in Guatemala. In Guatemala City, local people are largely tolerant of different lifestyles and small displays of affection between same sex couples are accepted. Outside Guatemala City attitudes are more conservative and same-sex couples should avoid public displays of affection. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
In most parts of the country you can carry a photocopy of your passport for identification purposes. In San Pedro La Laguna, Sololá, local authorities may not accept a copy of your passport as identification, and may fine or detain you if you can’t produce your original passport or a certified copy when asked. You should ensure that your passport has sufficient validity and a plentiful supply of unused pages before you travel.
