You do not have to to provide a negative PCR test if you have not been vaccinated against COVID-19.
Check with your travel company or airline for changes.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.

Travelling with children via South Africa
If you’re transiting through South Africa with children, see our South Africa travel advice page for information and advice about the documents you’ll need to carry.
Border formalities
It can take a long time to clear border formalities at the Lebombo/Ressano Garcia land crossing with South Africa, especially during holiday periods and if you are travelling on public transport. Allow adequate time to arrive at your destination before nightfall.
There have been reports of armed robberies close to the Lebombo border at Nelspruit. These often take place in queues for the border, when your vehicle is stationary, mainly after dark. When you stop at junctions or in queues, ensure you can see the tyres of the car in front of you, giving you space to escape if you need to.
