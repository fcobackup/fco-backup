There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Hong Kong.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Hong Kong, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no flight is advertised here.
Flights
Limited direct flights from Hong Kong to the UK are still available, but they are likely to be suspended at short notice. Some airlines have announced a total suspension of passenger services (e.g. British Airways from 8-24 April and Virgin Atlantic from 20-26 April). Since 8 April, Cathay Pacific are operating two flights a week (on Wednesday and Sunday) from Hong Kong to London.
Indirect flights are also increasingly limited. If you choose an indirect flight, you should check that the country in which you plan to transit allows you to do so.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
