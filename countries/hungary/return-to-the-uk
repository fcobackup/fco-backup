There remain commercial options to return to the UK from Hungary. If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Hungary, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating. Do not contact the contracted travel management company if no special charter flight is advertised here.
Countries neighbouring Hungary (Austria, Croatia, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine) have also introduced restrictions. Check country-specific FCO Travel Advice for details. Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
