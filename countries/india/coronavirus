See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
All regularly scheduled international flights remain suspended. However, under a bilateral agreement between the UK and Indian governments, a limited number of flights between India and the UK continue to operate. To book and for more information you should check airline websites, which contain important guidance prior to travel. The British High Commission cannot assist with ticketing. The aviation sector remains unpredictable and is subject to change with limited notice.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in India.
More information and detailed guidelines for International Arrivals are available on the Ministry of Health website.
Returning to the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK.
You are responsible for organising your own COVID-19 test, in line with UK government testing requirements. You should contact local authorities for information on testing facilities. More details on testing labs is available on the Indian Council of Medical Research website.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in India
Coronavirus cases in many parts of India are currently on the rise. Further restrictions may be implemented at short notice and may vary between states. New restrictions may involve city or state-wide restrictions like night curfews, weekend curfew and/or the imposition of Section 144 restricting the assembly of groups of people in public spaces. Other measures may include the requirement to present COVID-19 negative tests to enter some states, random testing in public areas including at airports, stations, malls and restaurants. You should monitor local media and follow any procedures put in place by local authorities. Before undertaking inter-state travel in India you should check the latest entry requirements and other testing/quarantine restrictions. Strict restrictions remain in containment zones.
The wearing of facial/cloth masks is compulsory in all public places. There are strict restrictions on large gatherings. You may be penalised if you violate restrictions. Domestic flight operations resumed on 25 May 2020 but some states may have restrictions on flight operations. Check with airlines before booking flights. More information and detailed guidance is available on the websites of Ministry of Civil Aviation and Ministry of Health. Some states have quarantine requirements in place and these may differ between states. Follow the advice of the local authorities. All regularly scheduled international flights remain suspended.

Healthcare in India
Coronavirus cases across India have risen sharply over the last few weeks. The healthcare system has come under significant strain as the number of COVID-19 cases increases throughout India. Critical care capacity is severely limited including shortages of equipment, oxygen, and bed spaces for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 emergencies.
RT-PCR testing has also become more difficult to arrange or results may take longer than expected, including for those who need negative RT-PCR tests for return to the UK. More information and detailed guidance is available on the website of the Ministry of Health. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 (coughing and fever and/or shortness of breath) and would like to get tested and get more information, contact a registered medical practitioner. A government supported central help line number +91-11-23978046 can be used to re-direct you to a medical practitioner. Testing is now also available on demand from private laboratories in the country. See additional guidance on testing. You may be liable for prosecution if you’re symptomatic or a confirmed case and deliberately attempt to hide symptoms and/or travel history.
