Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to Bermuda
Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, all visitors from a country classified by the WHO as having community transmission of COVID-19 (including the UK) will need to apply for a Bermuda COVID-19 Travel Authorisation 1 to 3 days before departure. They are also required to have a pre-departure test. They will need to receive a negative COVID-19 PCR test no more than 5 days before travel. Anyone arriving in Bermuda from the UK, or who has travelled through the UK within the 14 days prior to their arrival in Bermuda, must quarantine for 4 days upon arrival. They will need to receive a negative COVID-19 PCR test on or after the 4th day to leave quarantine.
Although Bermudian residents are technically permitted to travel without such a test, they will now need to pay $300 for a test upon arrival in Bermuda if they have not received a negative test before travel. Residents who are unable to self isolate at home will also be required to stay in a specified hotel until the results of their day 8 Covid test are confirmed.
This applies to adults and children aged 10 and up. Those without a negative pre-departure test will not be able to obtain Travel Authorisation. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You must wear face masks when travelling to the departure airport and practise social distancing at the departure airport.
Upon arrival, you must show a copy of your Travel Authorisation and present a copy of the pre-departure PCR COVID-19 negative test result to health officers on request.
All travellers will undergo PCR COVID-19 testing at the Bermuda L.F. Wade International Airport. It’s important that you adhere to the COVID-19 guidance and quarantine in your accommodation until airport tests results are ready. Failure to adhere to guidelines could result in a fine of up to $25,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment.
From 8th December, all residents and visitors to Bermuda are now required to wear a Traveller Wristband for the first 14 days of their stay. Removal of the wristband is not permitted and can result in a fine of $500 and home quarantining with an electronic monitoring bracelet. Persons who do not wish to wear the Traveller Wristband will quarantine at their accommodation for 14 days.
You should check the Bermuda Government website for more information and to apply for Bermuda Travel Authorisation.
