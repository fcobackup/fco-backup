See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
International travel
Fiji’s international border reopened on 1 December 2021. From 1 May 2022, fully vaccinated visitors to Fiji will no longer be required to produce a pre-arrival negative COVID-19 test prior to entry. Within 72 hours of arrival into Fiji, travellers 12 years and above must take an approved rapid antigen test at their hotel or testing facility. The Fijian Government website has more information on entry conditions. All foreign passport holders must have medical travel insurance with international cover for COVID-19.
You should carefully check requirements relating your country of departure, transit points and airline or other method of transport.
If you are based in Fiji, wish to travel internationally and have been vaccinated under Fiji’s vaccination campaign, you may require a COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate. See the section below on COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Fiji for more information.

Returning to the UK
Travelling from and returning to the UK
Check what you must do to travel abroad and return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Fiji
Although travel restrictions have been eased within Fiji, please ensure you check the latest rules carefully when making travel plans. More information on the latest restrictions are available on the Fiji government website.
Public places and services
Following the lifting of the majority of COVID-19 restrictions in October 2021, many businesses and public places have reopened.
The Government of Fiji has introduced regulations that require all workers in both the public and private sector to obtain a COVID-19 vaccination. Although formal requirements to check proof of vaccination have now eased you may be asked for proof of vaccination when entering businesses, including restaurants, bars and hotels.
COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Fiji
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Fiji announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Fiji government has a nationwide vaccination programme including some drive-thru sites. Details of vaccination locations are posted on a daily basis on Fiji’s Ministry of Health website as well as their Facebook and Twitter accounts.
The Fiji national vaccination programme started in March 2021 and is using the AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. You will need your residence Permit Number and a valid photo ID (Passport, Voter ID Card, FNPF Card, Driver’s License, Student ID, TIN Joint Card) to register. Further information can be found on Fiji’s Ministry of Health website.
If you wish to travel internationally and have been vaccinated under Fiji’s vaccination campaign you should be aware that the vaccination cards used domestically may not be sufficient for international travel. You will need to apply for a COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate from the Ministry of Health and Medical Services. You are recommended to do this well in advance of travel.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad page.
If you’re a British national living in Fiji, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
