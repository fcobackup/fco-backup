The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, the rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
If there’s no deal, the rules for travel to most countries in Europe will change when the UK has left. Check your passport will still be valid for your trip.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Bulgaria. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Bulgaria guide and contact the Bulgarian Embassy if you have further questions. Read the Bulgarian Ministry of Interior guidance on travelling to Bulgaria after Brexit.
If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, the rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
If there’s no deal, the rules for travelling or working in Europe will change when the UK has left:
You should not need a visa for short trips. The European Commission has proposed that British Citizens would be able to stay in the Schengen area and other EU countries, including Bulgaria, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa.
Visits to Bulgaria within the previous 180 days before your date of travel will count against the 90-day limit. As Bulgaria is not within the Schengen area, visits to other EU countries will not count against this total. The 90-day visa-free period would not entitle you to work - most countries will require a visa and work permit. You may also need to get a visa before you travel if you’re planning to stay longer than 90 days, or your visit would take you over the 90 days in 180 days limit.
On arrival in Bulgaria you may be asked to confirm that you have sufficient funds available for the duration of your stay. As non-EEA nationals, different border control checks will apply, and you may also be asked to show a return or onward ticket. UK nationals would not have an ongoing right to use the separate lanes provided for EU, EEA and Swiss nationals. 
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Bulgaria.
