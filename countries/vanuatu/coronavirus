The Vanuatu authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
The Government of Vanuatu has announced that, as of 20 March, all Vanuatu ports of entry are closed until further notice. Permanent residents and citizens will be allowed to return but will be quarantined for 14 days on arrival. A limited number of flights are scheduled to depart until 25 March. There may not be any further scheduled service after that for some time. If you are visiting Vanuatu, you are advised to leave as soon as possible.
The Government of Australia has announced that from 9pm Australia Eastern Standard Time on 20 March, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March. As many flight connections to and from Vanuatu connect in Australia and New Zealand, options to depart Vanuatu have reduced. If youâ€™re resident in Vanuatu, you should be aware of the potential impact of the border closures and flight restrictions on future travel plans. See also Return to the UK
