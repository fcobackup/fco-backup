Sterling isn’t widely accepted for exchange into Belarusian Roubles (BYN). You could carry US dollars. Euros are also accepted.
You may be asked to present your passport for foreign currency exchange. You should only exchange foreign currency at government licensed booths. These can be found in or near major stores, hotels, banks and shopping centres. Exchanging money elsewhere can result in fines and/or arrest and the currency involved will be confiscated. It’s not possible to exchange BYN into other currencies outside Belarus, but you can do this before leaving Belarus.
There are plenty of ATMs in major cities. Credit and debit cards are widely used and can also be used to withdraw cash.
Inform your UK bank of your intended travel to Belarus before you depart to ensure they don’t block your card because of suspicion of fraudulent use in a foreign country.
