We have been monitoring the situation in Niamey closely since 26 July. Protests can be violent and the atmosphere can change quickly and without warning. We advise British nationals to remain indoors.
There has been a bulletin broadcast on national television, stating there is a military takeover. A curfew is in place between 00:00-05:00. You should remain vigilant and monitor travel advice
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Niger’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
Consular assistance and support to British people in Niger is provided in the first instance by the British Deputy High Commission in Lagos. See Consular Assistance.
Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Niger, including kidnapping. There is particular instability in the Tillabéri region of Niger, near the country’s borders with Mali and Burkina Faso. There is also particular instability in Diffa, near the Lake Chad Basin. There is a threat of retaliatory attacks due to Niger’s participation in the French-led intervention in Mali and due to its involvement in the regional fight to counter violent extremist groups.

States of emergency are in place in several states across the country. See Local travel
Levels of crime, especially in the capital Niamey, are high. See Crime
