Suriname has closed its borders owing to concerns about the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Scheduled international flights to and from the country are suspended and land border and ferry crossings closed.
KLM and Suriname Airways operate limited services to the Netherlands and USA. You should check their websites for further information, including the requirements for a COVID-19 PCR test, which may be required prior to boarding.
You will not be able to transit the USA if you have been to the UK, European Union Schengen Area or the Republic of Ireland in the last 14 days and you will require an ESTA to travel. Cost of the ESTA is USD14. Visit the ESTA website to apply for an ESTA.
