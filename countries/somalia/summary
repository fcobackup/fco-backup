Based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks, the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to:
the whole of Somalia, including Somaliland.
In addition and for security reasons the FCDO advises against all travel to:
Somalia, including Somaliland, except the cities of Hargeisa and Berbera.
For security reasons the FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
the cities of Hargeisa and Berbera
Any British nationals in areas of Somalia to which the FCDO advise against all travel should leave. Any British nationals in Hargeisa or Berbera whose travel is not essential should leave.
If you visit Hargeisa or Berbera, exercise a heightened level of vigilance and take care in public places where people gather. Monitor local and international media to avoid any demonstration or disturbance taking place. Leave any area of unrest quickly and don’t attempt to watch or photograph it.
Elections are due to be held in Somaliland on 31 May. Political rallies are expected across Somaliland in advance of the elections. You should avoid large gatherings and monitor local media for updates.
On 19 February, and again on 25 and 26 April, armed clashes involving security forces took place in Mogadishu. The situation remains volatile; you should exercise extreme caution and stay away from any demonstrations, as they may become violent.

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Somalia. There is a high threat of kidnap throughout the country. Terrorist groups have made threats against westerners and those working for western organisations. There is a constant threat of terrorist attack in Mogadishu and terrorists continue to plan attacks against westerners in the rest of Somalia, including Somaliland. Terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, including in crowded places, high-profile events, events involving government officials and in places visited by foreigners. Due to their use by government officials, hotels are considered legitimate targets by terrorist groups. See Terrorism
There is a high threat of maritime crime in the territorial and international waters off Somalia and attack remains a significant threat in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. See Sea travel
Conflict and environmental problems such as drought and flooding have displaced hundreds of thousands of people, in all areas of the country. See Local travel
Land borders with countries neighbouring Somalia may close at short notice. You should check with local authorities before travelling to the border. You should also monitor Travel Advice for Ethiopia, Kenya or Djibouti. You should not cross the border without the correct documents.

If you’re in Somaliland, you should contact the British Embassy in Addis Ababa.
