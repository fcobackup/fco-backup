Iceland is volcanically and seismically active.
A large volcanic eruption took place in the area around the Bárðarbunga volcano on the Vatnajökull glacier in the east of Iceland in August 2014. Eyjafjallajokull and Grimsvötn volcanoes erupted in 2010 and 2011 respectively causing disruption to Icelandic and European airspace.
Further volcanic eruptions are possible and there is the potential for sulphur dioxide and other volcanic gases to be emitted during eruptions as well as causing glacial floods.
If you have existing respiratory conditions, take particular care and monitor the advice of the Icelandic authorities.
There has been recent seismic activity in the South West and North of Iceland. Tremors can be numerous but usually don’t cause damage. However, they can cause rock falls and avalanches in the mountain areas. You should take care when driving and hiking in these areas. Follow the safety advice of the Icelandic authorities.
Up to date information on seismic activity and the effects of volcanic eruptions in Iceland can be found on the following websites:
