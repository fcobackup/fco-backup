This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Thailand as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
For information on entering or transiting through Thailand, see Entry requirements
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Thailand to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). There have been several cases of foreign nationals being arrested and fined or sentenced to jail for breaching restrictions.
Moving around in Thailand
Travel between provinces
Internal bus and train routes are opening up and travel between provinces is now permitted. However, travellers moving between provinces may be required by local authorities to undergo quarantine on arrival in a new province so you should check the requirements for your destination.
If you are taking an internal flight in Thailand, you may be asked to download an app or complete additional travel documentation. Some regional airports are temporarily closed – please double-check before travelling. There may be road checkpoints in place across Thailand so you should carry a passport as proof of identification when in public.
Provincial authorities may enforce measures which are stricter or different to those in other areas, including closing borders, imposing internal travel restrictions, making masks compulsory or closing hotels and beaches.
Further measures may be introduced at any time. You should follow the advice of the Thai authorities. Keep up to date with the latest health advice provided by Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health and updates from the Thai Government on the situation.
Social measures
An emergency decree is currently in place until 30 June 2020. A number of measures have been outlined stating, among other instructions, that you must not:
enter high risk areas
hoard essential goods
attend public gatherings
propagate false information
All passengers must wear masks on all public transport. Many shops have the same requirement.
The Thai Department of Disease Control linked the smoking of cigarettes to the impact of coronavirus. Smoking in public is banned and can result in a fine of up to 5,000 Baht. Electronic cigarettes are already illegal in Thailand and their use may incur further fines or imprisonment.
Some entertainment venues such as pubs and clubs are still temporarily closed. Some provinces may impose stricter measures including lockdowns on certain premises.
A phased lifting of lockdown measures across Thailand is underway. Details of the measures may differ between different provinces. Measures may also change or even be reimposed at short notice in response to COVID-19 conditions. Check the details for the province where you are. Most shops and malls etc now have processes in place to register customers on entry and exit.
Visa extensions
The Thai government has announced that they will grant a further automatic extension to 31 July for visas of all types expiring on or after 26 March 2020. You do not need a supporting letter from your Embassy. Interpretation may vary in different areas - check with your local immigration office. For further information visit the Thai Immigration website or call the Immigration Bureau hotline on 1178.
It is unlikely you will be able to renew a visa by leaving Thailand and returning as Thailand has introduced further measures at its borders. Stay informed and plan accordingly.
If you are required to provide notification of staying in Thailand and your stay permit expires between 26 March and 31 July 2020 it will be automatically extended. However, when the situation improves or returns to normal, you will need to follow normal processes under the instruction of the Immigration Bureau.
Check that your passport is still valid, as you are legally required to have a valid passport in Thailand. Any visa you hold will become invalid from your passport expiry date. If you need to renew or apply for a new British passport, this facility is now available again through our partner agency VFS: see Overseas British passport applications.
Health
The Thai authorities have advised the elderly (over 70 years), children (under 5 years) and those with pre-existing medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, respiratory diseases, lung diseases) not to leave their home except for essential purposes, such as buying groceries, conducting business transactions, going to a hospital or filing complaints to the police.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Thailand and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This is a last resort option for those most in need and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, you should contact your local British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
