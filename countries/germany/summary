The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to:
The whole of Germany based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
The German government has restricted air and sea travel to Germany at its external Schengen borders. Travellers from the UK are currently only permitted to enter Germany if they are returning to their place of residence or serve in an important role or if there is an urgent need for their travel. Please be aware that the German government is currently advising against all non-essential travel.
From 30 March travellers flying to Germany from the UK or anywhere else must possess a negative COVID-19 test prior to departure for presentation to the airline. The test must be taken no more than 48 hours prior to entry. The result of the test required by the German authorities can be in either paper or electronic form. Children aged five or under are exempt. Even with a negative test, travellers will still be required to self-isolate for 10 days following arrival in Germany, with the possibility of test and release after 5 days in some areas. Contact your local public health authority for further details on test and release.
If you are returning to the UK from Germany, you will need to self-isolate on your return (unless you are exempt). Check the latest guidance for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
The FCDO is not advising those already travelling in Germany to leave at this time. Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. You should contact your tour operator or airline if you have any questions about your return journey.
Travel is subject to possible quarantine
There are currently COVID-19-related testing and quarantine requirements on arrival into Germany from any part of the UK. See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details before you travel
check if you need to self-isolate on your return
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
