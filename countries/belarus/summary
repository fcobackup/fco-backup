On 26 March, the Belarusian government announced that all arrivals from countries affected by coronavirus must self-isolate for a period of 14 days, regardless of whether they show symptoms. From 25 June, those arriving from the UK with a medical certificate showing a negative coronavirus test result, issued no later than 48 hours before entry, will not need to self-isolate.
Belavia has announced that, from 11 May, all passengers will be required to provide and wear protective face masks on all flights and at Minsk National Airport. See Entry requirements.
You’ll need to have valid medical insurance before travelling to Belarus. You’ll be asked to provide proof of your insurance when you apply for your visa or when you arrive at Minsk airport under the visa-free regime. Contact the Embassy of the Republic of Belarus for full details of what’s required.
Although there is no recent history of terrorism in Belarus, attacks cannot be ruled out. Attacks could happen anywhere and could affect western interests and places visited by foreigners. See Terrorism
Around 14,000 British nationals visit Belarus every year. Most visits are trouble-free.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
