Further restrictions apply in Bogota, based on gender. Going outdoors for grocery shopping, banking, financial and notarial services will be restricted to males on odd numbered days, and to females on even numbered days; transgender people may follow the restrictions based on the gender with which they identify. These restrictions do not apply to accessing health services.
