Tajikistan is located in an active seismic zone. Thereâ€™s been an increase in the number of earthquakes in Tajikistan during 2016 and 2017; most are small but affect remote areas of the country, particularly the east in Badakhshan province. Avalanches and landslides often block roads in the spring and early summer.
You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake and follow the advice of the local authorities. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
In late spring and summer Tajikistan is prone to seasonal flooding and mudslides caused by melting glaciers. Take care, follow local advice and be aware that conditions can change suddenly.
Heavy snowfall in winter can cause delays and cancellations at airports, and can disrupt local travel, particularly in mountainous regions where there is an increased risk of avalanches. Take local advice on road conditions during or following severe weather.
