Visa requirements
South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands has restricted access and visitor permits are required. The Commissioner of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands, based in Stanley, Falkland Islands regulates all access to the Territory.
Visas aren’t required, but you must apply to the Commissioner for permission to land on the Islands before you travel regardless of your nationality or mode of transport. If you’re travelling on a cruise ship or yacht the vessel operator will normally submit your visit application and handle the administration of your visit on your behalf.
Masters of vessels and visit permit holders must report to the Government Officer at King Edward Point on arrival in South Georgia.
Passport validity
You must hold a valid passport to enter South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands.
Visitor fee
For visitors staying up to 3 days there is a basic fee of £130.
For visitors staying longer than 3 days, there is an additional charge of £20 per day (or part thereof), to a maximum fee of £210. This higher rate covers a visit of up to 1 calendar month (eg 20 November to 19 December). Beyond 1 calendar month the visitor fee structure is applied again, as if for a new visit.
Visitor fees run from midnight to midnight, and a visit commences with the first landing (or other activity detailed on the post-visit report form). Further information can be found in the Visiting South Georgia guide produced by the Government of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands.
