This section has safety advice for regions of Benin. It only covers regions where the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has specific advice.
You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and safety and security advice.
Northern border regions
FCDO advises against all travel to the Parc du W National Park and the connecting hunting zones of Meêkrou and Djona. The park is tri-national, sharing an open border with Burkina Faso and Niger. There is a risk of terrorist attacks throughout the park.  
FCDO also advises against all travel to:
the area between the Parc du W and the border with Niger
the Pendjari National Park and adjacent hunting grounds
all other areas within 5km of the border with Burkina Faso
There is a threat of kidnapping from terrorist groups operating in the region. There is a heightened risk of kidnap in Benin’s northern border region.
The authorities sometimes set curfews in northern Benin. Keep up to date with security measures and follow the advice of the local security authorities.
Eastern Benin
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the area between the Interstate Highway (RNIE) 2 from Tchaourou to Malanville and the Benin-Nigeria border, due to increasing criminality.
