Hurricanes
Tropical Storm Ian (which is expected be declared a Hurricane within the next 24 hours) is expected to reach Cuba on the evening of Monday 26 September. The US National Hurricane Centre has issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Pinar del Río, Artemisas and Isla de Juventud in Western Cuba. The NHC has also issued a tropical storm warning for the provinces of La Habana, Mayabeque and Matanzas. Strong winds and heavy rainfall is expected and there is the risk of flooding, coastal storm surges, and mudslides.
You should closely monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator including any evacuation orders. Spanish language alerts are available from the Cuban Defensa Civil (Civil Defense) organisation.
See our Tropical Cyclones page for advice on what to do if you are caught up in a storm.
The hurricane season in the Caribbean frequently coincides with heavy rains, which may cause flash floods and landslides. In the aftermath of a hurricane in Cuba, power, communications and water supplies can be disrupted. Even in holiday resorts, utility services can’t be guaranteed. In the event of extreme weather conditions flights to and from Cuba may be delayed or cancelled.
Earthquakes
Cuba is located in an active earthquake zone. Strong earthquakes occur infrequently and most seismic events pass unnoticed. If a natural disaster occurs, follow the advice of the local authorities.
To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see this advice from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
