Military leaders released a statement on 24 January saying the President has been detained and the government and constitution have been suspended.
Air borders were suspended and while they have re-opened, only a small number of flights are operating. We cannot rule out air space closing again with no notice. Check with your operator before heading to the airport. Land borders are still closed for private journeys and only open for humanitarian vehicles, necessary goods and equipment destined for the defence and security forces. The curfew has been removed. A ban has been introduced on public celebrations and festive events taking place after midnight on Monday to Thursday and after 2am on Friday to Sunday.
While the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office continues to monitor the situation, we have no British Embassy in country and are very limited in the assistance we can provide.

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Burkina Faso, including Ouagadougou. Attacks could be indiscriminate, affecting Burkina Faso security forces, religious sites, restaurants, schools, markets and places visited by foreigners. On 26 April 2021, one Irish national and two Spanish nationals were killed in an ambush on the PK 60 road between Fada-N’Gourma and Pama. On 4 to 5 June 2021, over 160 people were killed in an attack on the village of Solhan in north-eastern Burkina Faso. Further attacks are possible. You should exercise particular caution around religious holidays. See Terrorism.
There’s also a risk that terrorist groups may cross the border from Mali and the northern border with Niger into Burkina Faso to carry out kidnap attacks. On 11 May 2019, four hostages, including westerners, were rescued during a French military operation in northern Burkina Faso. Two of the rescued hostages were French tourists who had been kidnapped from Pendjari National Park in Benin on 1 May 2019. See Kidnap.
In June 2019, Burkina Faso passed a law criminalising the dissemination of information about terrorist attacks and security forces that could undermine public order or the conduct of security operations.
On 24 June 2021, the government extended the state of emergency in the following six regions for 18 months: Centre-Est, Est, Nord, Boucle du Mouhon, Sahel and Hauts-Bassins. The measure gives security forces extra powers to search homes and restrict freedom of movement.
You should exercise caution and avoid large political rallies and gatherings, areas of demonstrations and protests. Crowds can gather quickly and may become violent. In the event of unrest monitor local media and follow instructions and announcements from the local authorities.
UK health authorities have classified Burkina Faso as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the National Travel Health Network and Centre website.
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
