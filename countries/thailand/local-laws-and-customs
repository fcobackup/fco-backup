There are some differences between UK and Thai local laws and customs that you should be aware of.
The British Embassy in Bangkok has produced a short video on Facebook and Twitter about some important things to be aware of when living or travelling in Thailand.
LGBT+
Thailand is generally a safe place for LGBT+ travellers. Same-sex relationships are not criminalised by law.
Thailand has no legislation on same-sex marriage and same-sex marriages conducted elsewhere aren’t recognised. See our information and advice page for the LGBT+ community.
Drugs
Thailand has strict laws against drug use, possession, and trafficking. Possession of even small quantities of illegal substances can lead to heavy fines or imprisonment, and possession of Class A drugs can lead to the death penalty.
As of 9 June 2022, private recreational use of cannabis is legal if THC content is below 0.2% by weight, but cannabis use in public places remains illegal. Cultivation, consumption, distribution and sales of cannabis products is legal, although some restrictions remain in place - you should check with the relevant local authorities if you are unsure. More information on usage and registration can be found on PR Thai Government.
Smoking
It is illegal to import more than 200 cigarettes per person into Thailand. This is enforced at customs on arrival. Those who exceed the limit may be fined ten times the value of the items and face confiscation of the cigarettes.
Smoking in public could result in a fine of up to 5,000 Baht. This includes electronic cigarettes which are illegal in Thailand and their use may incur further fines or imprisonment.
Wildlife
Thailand is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). It’s illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence and the ivory trade is banned.
Detention facilities
Conditions in prisons and other detention facilities in Thailand are harsh, with limited access to healthcare. There have been recent cases of detainees dying in custody.
