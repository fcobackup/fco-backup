Public spaces and services
The Polish Government has declared the whole of Poland an amber zone from 10 October meaning stricter sanitary rules are in place. Some higher risk areas of the country are referred to as red zones. These areas include tourist destinations and even stricter rules are in place in these areas. Follow the advice of the local authorities if travelling to red zones.
Masks are compulsory in open public spaces across Poland. Children under 4 are not required to wear masks. If there are medical reasons why you cannot wear a mask, you should carry a doctor’s note with you explaining this. When outside, you should keep a 1.5 metre distance from others, unless you are a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a disabled person.
You must also wear a mask at all times in enclosed spaces, on public transport, in taxis or in an open space where you are unable to maintain a 1.5 meter distance. Police and sanitary inspectors are entitled to issue you with an on-the-spot fine (approximately PLN500/£100) if you are found not to be wearing a mask when you should. Further prosecution could result in a fine of up to PLN 30,000 (£6,000) for failing to follow sanitary rules.
There are restrictions on the number of people attending religious services and funerals. You are allowed to organise wedding receptions and other family celebrations for up to 75 people in amber zones, 50 people in red zones.
Public transport is operating with reduced capacity seating to maintain appropriate distance between passengers. You can still use taxis.
Some sporting facilities are open with limits on visitor numbers. If you plan to visit a cultural or sports venue we recommend first consulting their website for information about opening. Many have information in English as well as Polish. National Forests, parks and beaches are open.
There are no limits on customer numbers in shops but you must wear a mask and use the hand sanitiser provided for customers.
Restaurants and pubs are permitted to open with limits on opening hours but you must only take off your mask when seated at the table. Hairdressers may also open by appointment only. Most museums, libraries and cultural venues are open.
Congresses, fairs, sporting events and cultural events (including concerts) from 10 October will be limited to much lower spectator numbers. In red zones they will be cancelled. If you have tickets for an event that may be affected check with event organisers for further information.
Swimming pools, gyms, indoor play centres, saunas, tanning salons, massage salons and tattoo parlours are also open, with strict hygiene rules in place including limits on numbers of people.
For updates on areas with stricter measures in place which are labelled red and amber zones see the Polish Ministry for Health’s Twitter pages (in Polish – look for the colour coded map).
The above national measures may be extended further, in scope and time, at short notice. In areas with high infection rates, the authorities may set local restrictions at short notice resulting in further reductions in numbers of people permitted to enter a venue, or in some cases complete closure.
Road and air travel
You can enter and depart Poland by car or coach over some land border crossings, though the situation could change quickly.

Hotels and short term accommodation establishments are open subject to strict sanitary rules.
