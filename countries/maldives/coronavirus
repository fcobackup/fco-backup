COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Maldives
We will update this page when the Government of the Maldives announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Maldives national vaccination programme started in February 2021 and is using the AstraZeneca and Sinopharm vaccines. From 15 January 2022, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is being administered as a booster dose for those over 18 who have completed their second COVID-19 vaccine at least six months previously. The Government of the Maldives has stated that resident British nationals over 12 years old are eligible for vaccination, if they choose to join the programme. All residents are requested to register on the My Health Portal where you can also book an appointment for vaccinations. The Maldivian authorities have published FAQ on vaccines.
Find out more, including about vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad.
If you’re a British national living in the Maldives, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
