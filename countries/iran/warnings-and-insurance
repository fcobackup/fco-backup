FCDO advises against all travel to Iran  
FCDO advises against all travel to Iran. British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention. Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you.

Political situation in Iran  
Israel continues to operate militarily against Iran. Reports suggest that military and nuclear installations across the country have been hit, and senior military and political leaders killed in the strikes. Israel has claimed responsibility. A significant Iranian military response is ongoing.
The situation could escalate quickly and poses significant risks. We continue to advise against all travel to Iran.
Monitor this travel advice and other media to ensure you have the latest updates.
Read FCDO advice if you’re affected by a crisis abroad.
Limited UK government support  
UK government support is extremely limited in Iran. Assume that no face-to-face consular assistance will be possible in an emergency and the UK government will not be able to help you if you get into difficulty in Iran. 
Travel insurance 
If you choose to travel to Iran against FCDO advice, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
