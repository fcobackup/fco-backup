Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Burkina Faso, including in Ouagadougou.
Attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning. Places frequented by foreigners, including diplomatic premises, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, stadiums, concert halls, shopping areas, markets, national infrastructure, airports and other transport hubs, places of worship (especially churches), national parks, businesses with western interests and foreign, national and local government facilities may also be targets of attack.
You should be vigilant, be alert to announcements, monitor local media and follow the advice of the local authorities. Avoid all large gatherings, including music festivals, shows, concerts, sporting events and any public marches or demonstrations. You should exercise extra caution during election periods, festivities, and religious and public holiday periods.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism.
Burkina Faso contributes to the UN peacekeeping initiative in Mali (MINUSMA) and is therefore considered a legitimate target by Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-M) and its associated groups. On 18 September 2018, armed, masked men purporting to be members of AQ-M posted an online video announcing their presence in Burkina Faso.
Two military zones are currently in place in Soum in the north, and in the south-east on the border with Benin. Civilians found within them risk being mistaken for terrorists and caught up in military operations.
Security mitigation is limited outside the capital Ouagadougou. There have been regular attacks on police, military personnel and civilians, particularly close to the borders with Mali, Niger and Cote d’Ivoire and in the Eastern Region.
Notable recent attacks include:
On 11 June 2022, over 100 people were killed following a terrorist attack in Seytenga in the province of Seno, close to the border with Niger.
On 4 to 5 June 2021, over 160 people were killed in an attack on the village of Solhan in north-eastern Burkina Faso.
On 26 April 2021, one Irish national and two Spanish nationals were killed in an ambush on the PK 60 road between Fada-N’Gourma and Pama.
On 29 to 30 May 2020, around 50 people were killed in three separate attacks in the eastern Kompienga region, and in the northern provinces of Sanmatenga and Loroum. The deadliest of these attacks killed at least 25 people after unidentified gunmen opened fire at a cattle market.
On 24 December 2019, 42 people were killed following a terrorist attack at a military outpost, The attack took place in Arbinda in northern Soum province, close to the border with Mali.
On 1 December 2019, at least 14 people were killed after gunmen opened fire inside a church in Hantoukoura, eastern Burkina Faso.
On 5 November 2019, 37 civilians were killed and 60 injured following an attack on a convoy carrying workers to a Canadian gold mine near Boungou, in eastern Burkina Faso.
There have also been attacks in the capital, Ouagadougou:
In March 2018, an attack took place on the French Embassy and the Army Headquarters. 16 people were killed, including 8 attackers, and 80 people injured.
In May 2018, Burkinabe security forces engaged the suspected attackers in the Rayongo district, on the outskirts of the capital. Three suspected terrorists were killed, and 5 gendarmes and 1 civilian wounded. Weapons and bomb-making materials were found at the scene.
There is a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.
Kidnap
There is a very high threat of being kidnapped in Burkina Faso including in Ouagadougou. British nationals are viewed as legitimate targets, including those engaged in tourism, humanitarian aid work, journalism or business sectors. If you’re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as a protection or secure your safe release.
The threat of kidnap is likely to continue as groups remain intent on demonstrating capability and increasing influence across the region. AQ-affiliated and other regional Islamist groups including Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) and Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP) operate in the region. These groups rely on kidnapping for ransom to finance their activities and will continue to target foreign nationals.

On 15 January 2019, a Canadian citizen was kidnapped near Gayeri in the Est region and found dead near the Niger border 2 days later.
In mid-December 2018, a Canadian and Italian were kidnapped in southwest Burkina Faso. They were found alive by UN peacekeepers in March 2020 in north-east Mali after reportedly escaping.
In September 2018, 2 foreign nationals were kidnapped in the far north by an armed group.
In January 2016, 2 western nationals were abducted in the northern town of Djibo near the border with Mali, one of whom has since been released.
A number of hostages kidnapped in Burkina Faso are still being held by terrorist groups.
You should maintain a high level of vigilance at all times, especially when travelling and in crowded public places, including camps for displaced people, religious gatherings and insecure spaces such as places of worship, markets, shopping areas, hotels, bars, nightclubs, restaurants and transport hubs. You should make sure you have carefully considered the threat and have reasonable, proportionate mitigation measures in place.
The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.
