This page has information on travelling to Jordan.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Jordan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Jordan’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
All travellers
You will need a visa to enter or travel through Jordan as a visitor. This can be acquired on arrival.
For more information on visa requirements, see Visas section.
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for passengers entering Jordan. You do not need to complete any pre-departure declaration.
If you’re transiting through Jordan
Transiting passengers refers to passengers who land between the starting point and final destination of their journey and require to board a connecting flight with either the same airline or a different airline to their final destination.
International Transfer Passengers are permitted through Jordanian airports.
Passengers who transit through Jordan on their way to another country must stay within the airport airside areas, follow signs for transfer passengers, and comply with any airport security screening procedures before connecting onto your next flight.
If you are transiting through Jordan on your way to another country and will be passing through immigration (sometimes known as a layover), for example to stay in a hotel outside of the airport for a flight the next day, you need to check-in again and go through immigration.
Exemptions
Medical tourists are exempt from the health insurance requirement.
Check your passport and travel documents before you travel

If you are visiting Jordan, your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the time you arrive.
Dual nationals
If you are a British/Jordanian national, you are allowed to use your British passport on arrival, but will need to show your Jordanian passport on departure.
Visas
You can buy a single entry visit visa valid for one month on arrival at the airports or the Sheikh Hussein/North Border crossing at the Jordan/Israel border. The cost is 40 Jordanian Dinars. Some airlines may require passengers to submit a health declaration at the check-in counters.

If you’re entering for tourism you can get a combination of a visa and reduced cost entry to the major tourism sites by applying for a Jordan Pass online.

Land crossings
Land crossings are operating between Israel and Jordan and between the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Jordan. You can find the latest guidance on entering and exiting Israel via the land borders on the Israeli Ministry of Health’s website. If you wish to combine travel to Jordan with a visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, you can obtain a multiple entry visa before you travel from the Embassy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in London.
Previous travel to Israel
Evidence of a previous visit to Israel like an Israeli entry/exit stamp in your passport does not normally cause any difficulties when entering Jordan. It is, however, for the Jordanian authorities to determine the right of entry into the country. If you have any concerns, you should contact the Consulate of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in London.
