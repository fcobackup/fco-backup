This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in the British Virgin Islands set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Entry to the British Virgin Islands
Entry by air to the Territory is only permitted through the T B Lettsome International Airport.
Travellers who have been fully vaccinated, with the second dose of a World Health Organization approved vaccine administered at least 14 days before travel, can also enter the BVI by sea through the Road Town Jetty; Soper’s Hole Dock, West End; Great Harbour, Jost Van Dyke; or Spanish Town, Virgin Gorda.
Partially vaccinated travellers (those that have received one dose of a two-dose vaccine, or whose second vaccine dose was administered less than two weeks before arriving in the Territory) and unvaccinated travellers are only permitted to enter the BVI through the Road Town Jetty and the T B Lettsome International Airport.
Everyone (including children) entering the Territory will be subject to temperature checks and testing on arrival.
Testing and quarantine requirements
Fully vaccinated adults and unaccompanied children must:
pre-register for a rapid antigen test using the Hummingbird portal for your point of entry:
West End Ferry Terminal
Road Town Ferry Terminal
Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport
show proof of a negative RT-PCR COVID-19 test or a negative rapid antigen test taken within 48 hours prior to arrival. The type of test taken should be guided by the entry requirements of any country transited en route to the BVI
show proof of vaccination status
show proof of travel insurance with minimum approved coverage for quarantine accommodation costs, medical repatriation and COVID-19 medical costs, including hospitalisation, doctor’s visits and prescriptions
if for any reason proof of a negative test is not available, take a rapid COVID-19 test upon arrival at a cost of $50 and receive a negative result
Partially vaccinated and unvaccinated adults and unaccompanied children must:
register for a BVI Gateway Traveller Authorisation Certificate at a cost of $175.00
show proof of a negative RT-PCR COVID-19 test taken 3 to 5 days prior to arrival. Partially vaccinated travellers will also need to show proof of their vaccination status

quarantine for four days (partially vaccinated travellers) or seven days (unvaccinated travellers)
take a RT-PCR COVID-19 test on day 4 (partially vaccinated travellers) or day 7 (unvaccinated travellers). Travellers will be able to end their quarantine if they receive a negative test result
obtain approval from the Environmental Health Division if quarantining in a private residence, hotel or vessel
For information on testing and quarantine requirements for accompanied children, see below.
Where people are travelling in mixed groups, unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals will need to quarantine upon arrival whilst vaccinated individuals in the group will not be subject to quarantine measures providing they test negative on arrival.
Testing and quarantine requirements for accompanied children
Children aged 5 to 17 are required to follow the same testing and quarantine requirements as their parents/guardians. See Testing and quarantine requirements.
Children aged 4 and below must follow the same quarantine requirements as their parents/guardians but there are no testing requirements.
Further information can be found at the website of the Government of the Virgin Islands
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
The British Virgin Islands will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to visit the BVI. It’s normal practice for BVI immigration authorities to issue you with a one-month entry stamp on arrival. You may also be granted an extension for one further month. Extensions for up to 6 months are granted on the discretion of the Chief Immigration Officer provided that the individual can show proof of independent financial means. You may need to provide evidence of accommodation and your plans to leave the BVI at the end of your stay.
Travellers who hold an expired work permit and are re-entering the BVI must submit a written request to the Immigration Department at least 5 working days prior to travel. This also applies to holders of valid work permit exemptions.
For all other immigration and labour matters, including work permits, contact the BVI authorities:

Passport validity
You must hold a valid passport to enter the BVI. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, transit and exit from the BVI.
If you’re travelling via the USA on an ETD, you will need to get a valid US visa.
As the BVI is a British Overseas Territory, there is no formal British diplomatic or consular representation. UK ETDs are processed by the British High Commission in Barbados.
Departure tax
There is a US$50 tax for all passengers, payable on leaving the BVI by air ($15 departure tax, $5 security charge departure tax and a US$30 airport development fee). This is generally included in the ticket price. If you’re departing the BVI by ferry, a departure tax of US$20 per person or US$15 for residents is payable.
Visitors arriving by air or sea are also charged an Environmental and Tourism levy of US$10 on arrival.
