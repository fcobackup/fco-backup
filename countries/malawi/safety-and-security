Protecting yourself and your belongings
There is a risk of mugging and bag-snatching. Take sensible precautions to protect yourself such as:
avoiding walking in quiet areas, especially after dark
leaving valuables and cash in a hotel safe if possible
keeping copies of important documents in a separate place
Most thefts from tourists take place around main bus stations in urban areas. Report any thefts to the police as soon as possible.
Be cautious if over-friendly people approach you offering to act as guides, selling goods, or claiming to know you and asking for a lift.
Drink and food spiking
People have been robbed after eating drugged food. Do not accept food or drink from strangers.
Burglary and violent assault
There is a risk of house burglaries and violent assault, including by armed gangs. There has been an increase in break-ins in Lilongwe, Blantyre and Limbe, including violent assaults on residents. Review your security systems and watch out for anything unusual.

Transport risks
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Malawi, see information on driving abroad.
You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Malawi for up to 90 days. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence. If you get an international driving permit (IDP), you can drive for up to one year.  
Always carry your licence, and copies of your passport and your visa or residence permit when driving. You may need to show these at police checkpoints.
There are frequent fuel shortages in Malawi and there can often be long queues. Do not assume fuel will be available on your route. Plan ahead to make sure you can reach your destination.
Police use breathalyser tests and regularly stop vehicles for speeding. There are speed cameras on main roads, often where there are no speed limit signs. Police can give on-the-spot speeding fines. Drivers caught drink-driving or speeding can also have their licences and vehicles immediately confiscated. Convicted drivers face fines and possible imprisonment.
Driving standards and conditions
Driving in Malawi can be hazardous and there is a high rate of road fatalities. Potholes, animals, abandoned vehicles and cyclists can cause serious accidents, as can vehicles travelling at night without lights. Emergency services are basic.
Always wear a seatbelt and avoid travelling after dark.
Minibus and coach travel
Public minibuses and pick-up trucks are often in poor condition and overloaded. Larger coach services running between the major towns are more reliable.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Rainy season
The rainy season runs from November to April and can make road travel difficult. Floods can make areas of Malawi inaccessible.
Monitor weather services, including the:
Malawi governmentâ€™s Facebook weather page
Department of Climate and Meteorological Services
World Meteorological Organization
Check your route before travelling and follow the advice of the local authorities.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes are a risk in Malawi. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about what to do before, during and after an earthquake.
