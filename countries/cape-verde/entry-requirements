This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Cape Verde set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Cape Verdean Embassy in Paris, France (in French).
COVID-19 rules
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Cape Verde.
Passport validity requirements
To enter Cape Verde, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.
Visa requirements
You can enter Cape Verde as a visitor for up to 30 days without a visa.
To stay longer or to travel for other reasons, you must meet the Cape Verde government’s entry requirements (in Portuguese).
Traveller entry form
You must fill in a traveller entry form 5 days before you arrive in the country. This form includes an airport security fee (‘TSA’), which you must pay before you arrive.
If you’re travelling with a tour operator, check whether they can complete the form for you as part of the booking process.
See more information on the traveller entry form.
Children aged one and under do not need to fill in the traveller entry form.
Vaccine requirements
You must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination, if you’re coming from a country listed as a transmission risk.
For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations see TravelHealthPro’s Cape Verde guide.
Customs rules
There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Cape Verde. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.
