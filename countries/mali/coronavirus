International travel
A regional air traffic control strike in West Africa is affecting flights into and out of the capital Bamako. Check with your airline before travelling.
On 3 July, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) announced the reopening of land and air borders between Mali and ECOWAS countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Côte D’Ivoire, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo), which had been closed since January. Whilst direct flights have resumed on some of these routes, others have not due to operational capacity issues. You should check with your airline before travelling.
Leaving Mali
Travellers providing proof of a “complete COVID vaccination” (i.e. usually at least two doses) do not require a negative COVID test (PCR), as long as it is not a requirement for the country of their destination. If you do not have proof of a complete vaccination, you need to present a negative COVID test (PCR) certificate less than 72 hours old.
Entry and borders
See Entry requirements to find out what you will need to do when you arrive in Mali.
Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
