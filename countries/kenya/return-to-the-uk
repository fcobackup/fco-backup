date of birth
place of residence in UK

If registered with the British High Commission, we will alert you to any opportunities to book onto flights departing Kenya for the UK, should these become available. This travel advice will also be updated when options become available.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, contact the British High Commission via webform.
