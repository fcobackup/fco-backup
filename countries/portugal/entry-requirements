This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Portugal set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Portugal for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Portugal, including the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores
You can travel to Portugal for any purpose from the EU/EEA, the UK and from some other non-EU/EEA countries.
If you are travelling from any other non-EU/EEA country, you can only enter for essential purposes, such as to live with immediate family members, or for professional, educational, health or humanitarian reasons.
Check the Portuguese Immigration Service website for further details of the entry requirements.
Entering mainland Portugal
Before you travel to mainland Portugal
You must complete an online passenger locator card and be prepared to show:
your UK COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record (NHS COVID Pass), or
an EU digital COVID certificate, or
a certificate issued by a country that has joined the EU digital certificate system
For more information, see ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’ below.
If you do not have one of the COVID certificates mentioned above, or if entering Portugal from 1 December 2021 (subject to further clarification from the Portuguese authorities), you must:
take a COVID-19 pre-departure test before you travel (children under the age of 12, i.e. up to and including 11, are exempt)
this can be an antigen test taken within 48 hours of departure, or a RT-PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure. If you have an antigen test, make sure it meets the standards set out in the EU common list of Rapid Antigen Tests
check your test result identifies the type of test taken and gives your name, date of birth, the date and time the sample was collected and the date of the result
you should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test
Your airline may deny boarding if you cannot show one of these documents when you check-in for your flight. Check with your airline before you travel.
On arrival in mainland Portugal
You will be subject to health screening on arrival. If your temperature is 38ºC or over or you show signs of being unwell, you may be required to take a COVID-19 test and remain at the airport until you receive your test result.
Be prepared to show your COVID-19 vaccination certificate or negative COVID-19 test at border control, if requested.
Quarantining on arrival in mainland Portugal
If you have travelled from India, Nepal or South Africa to mainland Portugal and you do not have an NHS COVID Pass or EU digital COVID vaccination certificate as described above, you must quarantine for 14 days at your own accommodation or at a place indicated by the Portuguese health authority.
The rules on quarantining apply to passengers arriving by air, as well as by road, rail or sea.
If the quarantining rules apply to you, complete this form.
Airside transit in mainland Portugal
If you are transiting Portugal by air on your way to another country, you will also need to show an NHS COVID Pass, an EU digital COVID vaccination certificate or a negative COVID-19 pre-departure test certificate, even if you do not intend to leave the airport. You should also check the COVID-19 entry requirements for your destination country.

Entering Madeira and Porto Santo
Before you travel to Madeira and Porto Santo

You will be subject to health screening on arrival. You will be asked to show:
your UK COVID-19 vaccination or recovery record (NHS COVID Pass); or
a negative RT-PCR or antigen test certificate if you have not uploaded it to your passenger questionnaire
If you are unable to show one of these certificates, you will have to take a COVID-19 test on arrival and remain at your accommodation until the results are known. This will take about 12 hours.
If your test is positive or inconclusive, you will have to repeat the test until the result is negative and remain in isolation at your accommodation.
Check the Madeira Tourist Board’s information for visitors for full details of entry requirements
Entering the Azores
Before you travel to the Azores
All travellers, including children, must complete and submit a passenger questionnaire.

your UK COVID-19 vaccination and recovery record (NHS COVID Pass), or EU digital COVID certificate, or
a negative RT-PCR or antigen test taken within 72 or 48 hours of departure respectively
If your airline has allowed you to board without one of the above certificates, you will be required to take COVID-19 test on arrival
For more information, see ‘Demonstrating your COVID-19 status’ below.
Check the Visit Azores and regional government’s website for full details of entry requirements.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
The authorities on mainland Portugal and in the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record showing:
you have been fully vaccinated with an EU approved vaccine at least 14 days before travel, or
you have recovered from COVID-19 no less than 11 days and no more than 180 days before you travel.
If you are travelling with a printed copy of your UK certificate, make sure it is dated from 1 November onwards so that it can be scanned successfully, if required. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
Should you meet the criteria of the current COVID-19 restrictions, you should be aware that the rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training
if you are travelling to Portugal and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Portuguese government’s entry requirements. Check the Portuguese Immigration Service (scroll to the bottom of the page) and check with the Portuguese Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
if you stay in Portugal with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time spent in Portugal or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Portuguese border control, you may need to queue in separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Portugal as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Portugal your passport should not be stamped. You should proactively show your proof of residence as well as your valid passport at Portuguese border control. For further information, see our Living in Portugal guide.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
Make sure your passport is:
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave Portugal, or any other Schengen country
less than 10 years old
The 3 months you need when leaving a country must be within 10 years of the passport issue date.
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the minimum 3 months needed.
Travelling with children
Portuguese Border Control (SEF) advise that a child under the age of 18 who are travelling to Portugal alone or without a parent or legal guardian should either:
be met at the airport or point of entry by their parent or guardian, or
carry a letter of authorisation to travel from their parent or guardian. The letter should name the adult in Portugal who will be responsible for them during their stay. There is no legal requirement for the letter to be notarised. However, the onus is on the parent or legal guardian to provide reasonable evidence, including contact details, to confirm that adequate care arrangements are in place.
Resident minors leaving Portugal
A child under the age of 18 who is resident in Portugal must carry a notarised letter of authority from their parent or guardian if they’re travelling out of the country alone or without a parent or legal guardian. The letter of authority can be issued by:
one of the child’s parents (if the parents are married)
the parent the child lives with (if the parents are separated or divorced)
one of the adoptive parents (if the child is adopted) or
the child’s legal guardian
Further information in English, together with a standard form of words (in Portuguese), are available on the Portuguese immigration service website
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK ETDs are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Portugal.
