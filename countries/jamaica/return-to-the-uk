There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Jamaica.
UK special flight
A special flight will depart from Kingston Norman Manley International Airport on 8 June to London Heathrow. The booking facility for this flight is now closed.
This flight will operate from Jamaica and is for British tourists, short-term visitors and their direct dependants.
The flight is for British nationals, normally resident in the UK and dependants travelling with a British national. Vulnerable non-British UK residents with Indefinite Leave to Remain who have been outside the UK for no more than 12 months may be accommodated if there is sufficient capacity. Eligibility, including your UK address, will be checked before confirmations are issued. Vulnerable British nationals will be prioritised.
The 8 June flight will depart from Kingston Norman Manley International Airport at 16.30. It will land at London Heathrow Airport at 08.00 on 9 June.
The cost of the flight is £537 per person.
Passengers must be in possession of correct and valid documentation which allows entry to the UK. This will be checked before you board.
Your eligibility will be checked before your tickets are issued.
Flight information
CTM is working on behalf of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to manage special flight bookings.
Completing the booking process does not guarantee you a seat on a flight. Tickets will not be on sale at the airport. Do not travel to the airport without a confirmed ticket.
What to do after making your booking
When your flight details are confirmed, you will be sent an itinerary at least 24 hours prior to the flight departure. This will include additional check in information.
You will need to organise your own travel to the airport.
Passengers travelling must arrive at the airport by 12.30 on Monday 8 June.
Passengers on this flight will be required to follow new Home Office rules for people entering the UK, and self-isolate for 14 days.
Financial support for a flight
If you are a British Citizen and have exhausted all other options available to you for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government to cover the cost of the ticket.
You would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
Our partner CTM is authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO and details will be available when you are asked to pay.
Travel to the airport
You will need to make your own travel arrangements to get to Kingston, Norman Manley International airport. Please do not go to the airport if you do not have a confirmed seat.
Your journey home: re-entering the UK
When you return, you must follow the rules for entering the UK. You:
need to provide your journey and contact details up to 48 hours before you’re due to arrive in the UK
are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)
See also the list of people who are exempt from the border rules.
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
Future travel options
The Government of Jamaica has announced that borders will be open to certain international travellers from 15 June. This will offer the opportunity to airlines to resume scheduled operations from that date if they choose to do so. British High Commission is in contact with airlines, the Jamaican authorities and other governments to make sure information on commercial options for returning to the UK is available as soon as possible.
You may be able to make indirect travel arrangements via the USA or Canada, if possible, but you may have to wait before a flight becomes available. You should refer to those countries’ restrictions before travelling to ensure that you will be allowed to enter the country for onward connection.
Currently no airlines are regularly scheduled to fly to the USA or Canada. JetBlue is operating flights at short notice from Kingston and Montego Bay to Fort Lauderdale, Florida from time to time. Miami International Airport is 30 minutes away by bus and flights to the United Kingdom are operating. You will need an ESTA or a valid US visa.
