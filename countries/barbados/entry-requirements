The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Testing / screening on arrival
All travellers arriving in Barbados will be placed in a Barbadian government quarantine facility for 14 days.
The Ministry of Health and Wellness has issued a call for anyone who arrived in Barbados from the UK or US between March 15 and 22 to contact the ministry. This is to enable the ministry to make contact and ensure individuals remain well.
You may contact the ministry by phoning +1 (246) 832 6171 between 9am and 5pm local time. You may also convey the information by WhatsApp, text message or email covid19.hotline@health.gov.bb
Entry to Barbados
Barbados plans to amend its entry requirements to coincide with the re-opening of airspace and resumption of commercial flights. Specifically, the need for mandatory 14 day quarantine will be removed. Instead, all persons arriving in Barbados should be tested for COVID-19 at an accredited laboratory. You must take a COVID-19 PCR antigen test 72 hours in advance of your flight. The standard of test must be ISO, or CAP, or in the case of the UK, UKAS compliant, or equivalent. If you’re arriving from CARICOM countries, you’re allowed to be tested up to one week before travel. If you receive a certificate confirming you are COVID-19 negative, you will be allowed to enter Barbados.
If you arrive in Barbados without being tested, you will be subjected to a mandatory test on arrival at the Concorde Experience facility which is next to the airport. The cost of the test is US$150. You will need to isolate in your accommodation until the test results are provided. This can take a maximum of 48 hours.
Anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be taken to a Barbados government quarantine facility at Harrison Point, St Lucy.
In addition, all persons arriving in Barbados are required to wear face masks and will have their temperature taken.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British passport holders don’t need a visa to visit Barbados.
On entry, you will normally be granted a specified period to stay. If you wish to stay longer, you must apply and pay for an extension of stay through the Barbados Immigration Department.
It’s an offence to overstay the entry period or to work without a work permit.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Barbados.
Departure tax
A departure tax of BDS$55 (US$27.50) applies for all passengers over 2 years old leaving Barbados. From 1 October 2018, an additional fee has been added. Passengers flying outside of the Caribbean region pay US$70 per person, and those flying within the Caribbean pay US$35 per person. Most airlines include the cost within the ticket price. If in doubt, you should check with your airline or tour operator.
