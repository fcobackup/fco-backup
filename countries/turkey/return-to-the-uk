There are still commercial options to return to the UK from Turkey.
If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Turkey, you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t risk getting stranded.
UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in Turkey because commercial routes are operating. Please do not contact the contracted travel management company if no chartered flight is advertised here.

Financial assistance
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
Turkey has imposed restrictions on internal travel. You will need a travel permit:
to travel from one city to another
to go to the airport during a ‘full nation-wide’ lockdown, which is expected most weekends
if you are aged over 65 or under 20 and need to travel within the same city
To request a travel permit, submit a request to the British Embassy Ankara. You should make clear in the subject box that you are enquiring about a permit to travel, and have proof of your onward journey out of Turkey.
