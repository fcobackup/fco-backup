All airports in Serbia are currently closed to scheduled international passenger flights, but it is currently planned for airports to reopen for commercial flights on 18th May (subject to change). All border crossings for road, rail and river transport are formally closed, but it is possible to cross borders under certain conditions (including freight traffic). These measures, and those taken by neighbouring countries, mean there are no commercial means of leaving Serbia to return to the UK by air, road, rail or river until 18th May at the earliest. See Return to the UK.
Terrorist attacks in Serbia can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
High levels of air pollution can occur across the country. See Health
