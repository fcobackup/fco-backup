Illegal drug use of any kind carries stiff administrative and criminal penalties, including heavy fines and long prison terms. The penalty for smuggling even a very small amount of drugs carries a prison term of between 5 to 25 years and/or heavy fines.
You should carry a copy of your passport at all times and keep the original in a safe place.
Don’t photograph sensitive sites like military bases and power installations. Be aware of cultural sensitivities when photographing churches and other religious sites. Some visitors have been prevented from photographing the Presidential Palace in Tbilisi. Always seek permission if in doubt.
Tbilisi is a cosmopolitan city, but more conservative attitudes exist in rural areas. When travelling outside of the cities be aware of cultural sensitivities around modest dress, particularly when visiting places of worship, and open displays of affection.
LGBT+
Homosexuality is legal in Georgia, and the Georgian Parliament has adopted anti-discrimination legislation, but it is still not widely accepted in society. Open displays of affection may result in some discrimination and harassment. There have been some reports of sexuality-motivated harassment and assaults. Pride marches in 2019 and 2021 had to be called off because the police did not guarantee security, a violent protest against an event celebrating Pride in July 2023 caused its cancellation.
See our information and advice page for the LGBT+ community before you travel.
Accessibility
Accessibility standards in Georgia are different to those in the UK and EU. Very few public or private facilities are accessible. Most public transport offers no accommodation for persons with disabilities. There are few pavements outside of main cities and where pavements are present they are generally uneven.
Surrogacy
If you’re considering international surrogacy, you should read our ‘Surrogacy guidance for intended parents’.
If you’re visiting Georgia for the purpose of commissioning surrogacy arrangements, you should consider the potential risks and challenges involved in pursuing international surrogacy and seek specialist legal advice on Georgian and UK laws prior to making any arrangements.
Surrogacy is a complex and lengthy process which the British Embassy does not have authority to be involved in.  Commissioning a surrogacy does not mean the child will automatically be entitled to British citizenship. The FCDO and Home Office have produced guidance on this.
Research prospective surrogacy clinics and hospitals thoroughly to ensure you’re dealing with a safe and reputable organisation. The British Embassy cannot recommend specific hospitals or clinics.
From 1 September 2020, Georgian law requires you to provide evidence of marriage, civil partnership or cohabitation of at least a year, before a surrogacy contract can be entered into. You will need to provide evidence that a surrogacy contract was signed before the IVF process began in order to get a birth certificate.
To bring children born through surrogacy to the UK you must apply for a full validity British passport. You will need a Georgian birth certificate for this. You should check the Public Service Hall website, Service Development Agency or Community Centres and research the requirements to leave the country with children (some legal details are in Georgian only).
You should consider the time you will spend in Georgia and plan appropriately. The maximum period of continuous visa-free stay allowed by the Georgian authorities is one year. For more information see the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia website.
South Ossetia and Abkhazia
The Government of Georgia does not recognise the unilateral declarations of independence by the breakaway regions of South Ossetia or Abkhazia and, in accordance with international law, continues to claim the right to exercise sovereignty in the two territories. The UK government, along with almost all other states, recognises Georgia’s right to do so.
The Government of Georgia has implemented legislation which requires those trading with Abkhazia and South Ossetia to hold a licence issued by the Georgian Government. This includes buying and selling property and most financial transactions. Those who trade without licences may be open to penalties under Georgian civil and criminal law.
The ownership of many properties is disputed across both regions with many thousands of claims to ownership of properties from people displaced following the conflicts after the collapse of the USSR. Purchase of these properties could have serious financial and legal implications, including legal proceedings in the courts of Georgia, as well as attempts to enforce judgements from these courts elsewhere in Europe. A future settlement to these territorial disputes could have consequences for property purchased in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, including possible restitution of the property to its original owners.
