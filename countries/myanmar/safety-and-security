Political situation
Myanmar held national elections on 8 November 2020 in which the National League of Democracy Party won a majority. The military subsequently alleged fraud in the elections and demanded a review. On 1 February 2021, the Myanmar military declared a state of emergency and assumed control. There has been widespread political violence involving the deaths of hundreds of ordinary people, as well as a major rise in active clashes between armed actors.
On occasions of national significance – such as Myanmar National Day (4 January), the anniversary of the 2021 coup (1 February), Union Day (12 February), Peasants Day (2 March), Armed Forces Day (27 March), Martyrs Day (19 July), the uprising (8 August), the 2007 anti-government protests (throughout September) – there is a higher likelihood of opposition attacks and an increased presence of security forces.
Some areas in Myanmar are under a state of martial law, others may have curfews or ‘stay at home’ orders, for example, in Yangon, a number of townships have a curfew from midnight until 4am. You should ensure you are aware of local rules and restrictions before you arrive in an area.
Opposition activists regularly detonate small-scale improvised explosive devices across the country. Military and government buildings; police stations; and businesses, hotels and restaurants affiliated to the military (or perceived to be) are the main targets, but there have also been attacks on schools and hospitals. While small-scale, these devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated and the attacks more deadly.
Following the execution of high-profile political prisoners on 25 July 2022, there has been an increase in tensions across the country and the number of explosions in public places. Visitors to Myanmar should be extra vigilant.
You should remain cautious and avoid all demonstrations, large crowds and political gatherings. You should not attempt to photograph any gatherings. See Photography and drones for more information. You should remain vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities.
Ignoring military instructions or ignoring curfews could lead to detention and/or lengthy prison sentences. Curfews are in place nationwide. Local wards may unexpectedly change rules and curfew times and it is important to remain updated on local rules.
Yangon region
Whilst we no longer advise against all but essential travel to Yangon region, there is still a heightened risk. The security situation remains volatile and can change at short notice. If you are in the Yangon region, you should remain vigilant, exercise caution and seek local advice, especially if travelling to townships which are under martial law. The townships currently under martial law are Hlaing Thayar, Shwe Pyithar, North Okkalapa, North Dagon, South Dagon and Dagon Seakkan, but this is subject to change.
Security incidents in Yangon, like in the rest of Myanmar, continue to primarily target military regime-affiliated locations and personnel but may impact civilians and bystanders, including in areas regularly frequented by foreign nationals. This may include hotels, restaurants and accommodation complexes. Military installations, such as checkpoints, are also targets. If you encounter a threatening or intimidating situation, don’t try to make your way through it. Turn round and move to safety.
Crime
There are no accurate official statistics on violent crime or robbery against foreigners. Anecdotal evidence suggests that cases are low, although the economic pressure may cause an increase. The most common crimes are non-violent crimes of opportunity (pickpocketing, theft of unattended possessions in public places or hotel rooms, bag snatching, gem/confidence scams). Thieves often attempt to distract a victim by asking questions, begging for money, selling items, or bumping/jostling. You should take extra care of your belongings and take sensible security precautions at all times. You should be vigilant at all times, even if staying with friends, employers or hosts.
Myanmar is largely a cash-only society, make sure you have access to cash, but avoid displaying cash or other valuables in public.
Beware of merchants offering to sell gems, gold or semi-precious stones. This could result in a substantial loss of money and/or a violation of local laws. Do not buy gems or minerals from an unlicensed source.
Scams
Be aware of job offers that appear “too good to be true” in Myanmar and neighbouring countries. There is a growing number of cyber scam centres operating in eastern Myanmar – particularly the Myawaddy Region. Victims are trafficked into undertaking online scamming, held in poor living conditions, and subjected to severe mistreatment. Some victims have had their passports confiscated, and been held to ransom.
We are aware of fraudulent emails being sent by individuals claiming to work for British firms seeking loans to advance their business interests in Myanmar. These have falsely stated they are acting on advice of the British Embassy. See our pages on fraud and financial scams for further guidance.
Border areas
The UK advises against all travel to Northern Rakhine, Chin, Kachin, Karen, Karenni and Mon States and Sagaing Region. The UK advises against all but essential travel to Shan and Taninthartharyi States.
Myanmar has suffered from prolonged internal conflicts, involving a number of Ethnic Armed Organisations in Myanmar’s border areas. The possibility of violent clashes remains in some areas of all Border States.
Violence is severe and the situation is unpredictable in most ethnic states and border areas. The Myanmar authorities restrict travel to most border areas. In the North West and South East, there are active military operations involving the use of air strikes, artillery bombardments and ground troops.
Landmines
As a result of decades of conflict, the threat of landmines in rural areas is high, particularly in northern and central Rakhine, northern Shan and Kachin States. There is no reliable landmine mapping source, and there is evidence of landmine use spreading to other areas since the coup. Some areas with known mines are marked by signage, however this practice is not widespread. Visitors should exercise extreme caution if travelling off main roads in these areas.
Air travel
The FCDO cannot offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a list of registered airlines that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s unsafe. A list of recent incidents and accidents is available on the website of the Aviation Safety Network. A Myanmar National Airlines plane was shot at in Kayah in October 2022.
Airlines routinely share flight codes, meaning that airlines sometimes use aircraft from outside their own fleet. Passengers aren’t always advised in advance where this is the case.
Local flight schedules are subject to change without warning. Leave sufficient time in your travel itinerary to accommodate this.
Rail travel
Railway safety standards are significantly below those in the UK.
Road travel
Overland travel can be hazardous, particularly in the rainy season (May to October). Roads can become impassable and bridges damaged. Travel by road between many areas outside the key destinations of Yangon, Mandalay, Bago and Irrawaddy regions is restricted.
Road safety standards are significantly lower than in the UK. Under Myanmar law, the driver of a car involved in an accident with a pedestrian is always at fault. Many vehicles, including taxis and buses, are in a poor mechanical state, and serious road traffic accidents are common. Although driving is on the right in Myanmar, the majority of cars are right hand drive.
Sea and river travel
Seek local advice about where it is safe to swim or dive in the sea. River transport may not meet internationally recognised safety standards and search and rescue facilities may be limited.
Passenger ferries in Rakhine State have been subject to attacks.
During the monsoon season (May to October), heavy rains can cause flooding. Make sure life jackets are available and check local weather conditions before undertaking any river journey. All travellers should avoid wading, swimming or bathing in freshwater to prevent catching schistosomiasis. See Health
Mobile phones and Internet
The Myanmar authorities periodically cut off access to the Internet and have blocked several websites.
Myanmar’s technological infrastructure has improved. International GSM roaming is now available in Myanmar and all local networks offer 3G and 4G. If roaming is enabled, some UK SIM cards will work and coverage is fairly reliable in the main cities. UK mobile service providers may charge especially high prices for roaming in Myanmar.
Many visitors travel with a spare mobile phone and buy a SIM card for a nominal fee when they arrive. This can then be topped up as needed.
