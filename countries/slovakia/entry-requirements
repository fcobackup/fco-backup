The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and quarantine
As of 13 March, entry to Slovakia for UK nationals is generally only permitted if you have temporary or permanent residence in Slovakia, with some exceptions as below. Unless you qualify for one of the quarantine exemptions, you must pre-register with the Slovak authorities 72 hours in advance of travel to Slovakia and then on arrival enter mandatory quarantine in a government facility for 14 days. Once tested negative for COVID-19, the remainder of the 14 days can be spent in self-isolation at home.
If you qualify under one of the exemptions for mandatory quarantine in a government facility, you must still self-isolate at home for 14 days or risk incurring a fine of up to €1,650. For a list of exemptions (including transiting Slovakia) and other requirements, check the website of the Slovak government.
Since 23 May, the Slovak government has offered an alternative option of home quarantine controlled by a smartphone app “eKarantena”, instead of staying in a government quarantine institution. Before you travel you should read the conditions and follow the instructions carefully on the Slovak government website (the Slovak version gives the latest instructions). You will still need to be tested during your quarantine and must stay at home for 14 days.
Since 27 May, if you have permanent/temporary residence in Slovakia and are travelling to Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Switzerland or Germany and return within 48 hours, you will not need to show a negative Covid-19 test or enter quarantine on re-entry to Slovakia. However, you will need to produce a completed form for the border officials as you leave Slovakia and keep it for inspection on your return. For information, see the Slovak government website (in Slovak only) and download the multi-lingual form. You should check the entry requirements for the country you plan to travel to on the relevant FCO Travel Advice.
Since 4 June, if you can demonstrate that you have legal residence in either Slovakia, Austria, Hungary or the Czech Republic, there are no restrictions on crossing borders between those countries. You will not need to register in advance, show a negative Covid-19 test or enter mandatory quarantine.
Transport
Slovakia has closed its international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad to scheduled passenger flights.

Regular entry requirements
Passport validity  
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay; you do not need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Make sure your passport is in a presentable state before you travel. The Slovak authorities can refuse entry if your passport is worn or damaged, or looks as if it’s been tampered with.
Visas
If you hold a British Citizen passport, you don’t need a visa to enter Slovakia. If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our Living in Slovakia guide and contact the Slovak Embassy if you have further questions.
The rules on travel will stay the same until 31 December 2020.
Registering with the Slovak authorities
If you plan to stay in Slovakia for a longer period of time, you should register with the police within 3 days of arrival. You’ll need your passport, 2 photographs and proof of accommodation. You’ll have an option to apply for a Slovak ‘green card’, which can be used as proof of your ID, while your passport is kept in a safe place. Visit the website of Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic for further information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovakia. They are also accepted for a return to Slovakia if you normally live there.
