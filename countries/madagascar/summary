The cyclone season in Madagascar normally runs from November to April. Coastal areas are particularly affected, and remote areas throughout the country can become inaccessible and suffer damage and contamination to water supplies. Tropical Cyclone Batsirai passed through Madagasacar on Saturday 4 and Sunday 5 February, between Mananjary on the east coast and Tuléar (Toliara) on the south-west coast. High winds and heavy rainfall have caused flooding and damage to buildings, roads and bridges in eastern, central and southern regions. Communications, power and water supplies are disrupted in affected areas. You are advised to check your route before travelling through affected areas, and to follow alerts and instructions from the local authorities. See Natural disasters.

Take great care and follow local advice in the south of the country. In the southern triangle between Ihosy, Toliara/Tuléar and Fort-Dauphin the security situation remains tense and the roads are in very poor condition. There have been several attacks on vehicles. If travelling in the area you’re advised to use a recognised tour operator and to avoid travelling at night. Avoid overnight stays in the countryside. You’re advised not to travel by taxi-brousse (bush taxi). If you’re planning to travel to Fort Dauphin you should travel by air instead of via the RN 13. See Local travel - Southern Madagascar
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Madagascar, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
