Public spaces and services
Until at least 7 March there will be a range of restrictions on social contact in Germany, aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19:
private gatherings are restricted to one household plus one individual from another household
non-essential shops are closed. Shops selling food and healthcare products will remain open
personal care service providers such, as tattoo and massage parlours are closed. Barbers and hairdressers will open from 1 March. Physiotherapy and similar services are open
employers are legally obliged to allow employees to work from home, where their work activities allow, until 15 March
restaurants will be able to provide a takeaway service, but the consumption of alcohol in public is banned
services at churches, mosques and synagogues continue to be allowed as long as 1.5m distancing is maintained, mouth-nose coverings are worn and singing is banned
in some parts of Germany, local travel restrictions are in place and individuals cannot leave a 15km radius of their place of residence (meaning a village, town or city rather than a home)
Schools and nurseries are gradually being opened in February
Medical grade masks are compulsory in shops and public transport, replacing a previous requirement for simple mouth-nose coverings. Whereas Bavaria requires FFP-2 masks, other states permit a disposable surgical mask. You should follow local guidance. These restrictions are the minimum and are implemented by Germanyâ€™s 16 states. The rules may vary so check the latest local guidance (in German). There are a variety of sources in English.
These measures will next be reviewed on 3 March.
