The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Visas
British and EU passport holders no longer require a visa to visit Armenia. The entrance stamp is valid for a period of 180 days only. Children arriving on a British passport with parents entering Armenia on an Armenian passport will require an Armenian passport to leave the country; this is stated in Armenian law. For further details visit the: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Armenia website.

Dual nationals
Dual nationals entering Armenia using their Armenian passport and travelling with children on a United Kingdom passport should be aware that under Armenian Law a child of an Armenian passport holder is automatically regarded as Armenian and must present an Armenian passport to leave the country. The child may be detained on departure if he/she can’t produce one.
