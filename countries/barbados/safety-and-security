Take sensible precautions to protect your personal safety:

take care when walking alone off busy main roads and taking money from ATMs
avoid isolated areas, including beaches, particularly after dark
only use licensed taxis
take particular care around large gatherings, including street and beach parties, especially after dark or during the festival season
do not carry large amounts of cash or wear expensive-looking jewellery
leave valuables and travel documents in a safety deposit box or secure hotel safe
Laws and cultural differences
Illegal drugs penalties
It is illegal to possess drugs. There are severe penalties for all drug offences. Pack your luggage yourself and do not carry anything through customs for anyone else.
Camouflage clothing
It is illegal for anyone, including children, to wear camouflage clothing.
LGBT+ travellers
In the Caribbean, attitudes towards the LGBT+ community are mostly conservative. It is uncommon for opposite or same-sex couples to show affection in public, for example, holding hands or kissing. Doing this may attract unwanted and negative attention. Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Outdoor activities and adventure tourism
Swimming safety
Always take great care when swimming. Currents can be deceptively strong, including on some of the popular beaches on the south and west coasts. Some beaches do not have lifeguards or warning flags.
Swimming is not recommended on many of the east-coast beaches where currents are particularly strong. Follow local warnings.
