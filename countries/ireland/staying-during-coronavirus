Shielding, or cocooning, remains in place for everyone over 70 and categories who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Those cocooning may go outside for a short walk or a drive, within 5km of their home,whilst keeping to the social distancing guidelines.
Ireland’s transport network and services continue to operate safely and effectively, providing vital connectivity for essential workers and essential trade.
The Irish Government recommends wearing a cloth face covering in situations where it is difficult to practise social distancing, for example, in shops or on busy public transport. See more detailed guidance from the Irish Government on the safe use of face coverings.
The latest Irish Government guidance can be viewed on the Irish Government website.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you are unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Ireland, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.
