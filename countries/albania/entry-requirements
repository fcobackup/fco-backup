The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
All land borders are open. However neighbouring countries may have different entry and exit restrictions on their side of the border. You should check before travelling.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Albanian Embassy/Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
Quarantine and testing requirements
All travellers entering Albania from Greece and North Macedonia must quarantine at their accommodation for two weeks.
If you are a British national travelling to Kosovo from Albania, you will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. If you are a British national travelling from Albania and transiting Kosovo you will be asked to sign a declaration and you should leave the country within 3 hours from entering it. A negative RT-PCR test less than 72 hours old is required for all other foreign nationals entering Kosovo from countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases, marked as red or orange (more than 60 cases per 100,000) on the official ECDC map. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
If you are a British national with a Greek, UR or another EU/EFA state (or Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Thailand, Rwanda, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Russian Federation and Israel) residence permit and are travelling to Greece from Albania you must complete an online Passenger Locator Form (PLF) (in English) and must provide evidence of a negative result from a PCR test for COVID-19 that has been conducted within the 72 hour period before your arrival time in Greece. If you’re a British national who resides in Albania, you’re likely to be refused entry to Greece due to measures put in place by the Greek authorities to combat the spread of COVID-19.
For further details on COVID-19 testing requirements from the Greek authorities you can visit the FCDO Travel Advice for Greece.
British nationals who are resident in Albania and are travelling to Montenegro are exempt from the requirement for a test or proof of vaccination, but only if they enter Montenegro from that country and have not travelled elsewhere in the last 14 days.
If you are a British national travelling to North Macedonia from Albania, there is no requirement to self-isolate or provide a PCR test upon entry to North Macedonia.
