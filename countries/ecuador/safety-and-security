Crime
Muggings and pick pocketing are very common. In Quito, take particular care in ‘La Carolina’ and ‘El Ejido’ parks, the districts of ‘La Mariscal’ (Plaza Foch), ‘La Floresta’, ‘Bellavista’, ‘República de El Salvador’ and ‘La Marin’. Also at bus terminals and the old town including the main square and ‘El Panecillo’ hill, which you should avoid visiting on your own or by foot. Use one of the standard tours or reliable transport instead. In Guayaquil, be particularly careful in Urdesa, Kennedy, Alborada, Samborondón, Las Peñas, the south of Portete de Tarqui avenue and the Malecon Simon Bolivar districts (including Cerro Santa Ana) and the bus terminal. Look after your belongings. Methods of distraction include requests for assistance, staged fights and pushing or shoving. Do not resist robbery or mugging.
Do not wear expensive jewellery when walking around, carry only the money you need for the day and take care of your credit cards. Watch your bags on public transport (including on interstate bus journeys) and wear your rucksack on the front of your body. Where possible, do not store anything under your seat or in the overhead storage on buses.
Carry a colour copy of your passport, including the visa entry stamp page, and keep the original safe. Only take out as much money as you need.
Take care when withdrawing money from a bank or ATM. There have been cases of violent robbery outside banks. The Ecuadorean national police offers a free escort service from/to banks when large amounts are involved. You are encouraged to use this service, which you can request by calling 911.
Express kidnappings - short-term opportunistic abductions, aimed at extracting cash from the victim - also occur, particularly in Quito and Guayaquil. Victims can be targeted or selected at random and held while criminals empty their bank accounts with stolen cash cards. This type of crime can involve illegitimate and registered taxis. Ecuadoreans and foreign visitors are targets.
Criminals often use drugs to subdue victims. Homemade versions of the drug ‘scopolamine’ leave victims in a subdued, compliant state and cause amnesia. Be wary if you’re approached by a stranger offering you food, drinks, leaflets, perfume samples, telephone cards or cigarettes, no matter how friendly or well-dressed they appear.
Armed robbery is a risk throughout Ecuador, but especially in Quito, Guayaquil and in remote areas. The threat of crime has increased in recent years. Violent crime remains high in Guayaquil and Quito, with reports of homicide, gunpoint robberies and home invasions. Armed thieves have also intercepted vehicles and threatened passengers. Like other areas of the country, general crime rates and gang-related incidents have increased in Guayaquil during 2021. Particular caution should be exercised in the downtown and southern parts of the city. Seek local advice about the safety of the area you are visiting and travel in a group whenever possible.
Attacks and serious sexual assaults against foreign women increased in the city of Montañita (Santa Elena province in the west of Ecuador) in 2019 and 2020. All visitors, particularly women, should take extra care to find reputable and secure accommodation whether travelling alone or as a group. Avoid travelling after dark and be alert to the use of date rape and other drugs in drinks. If you feel unwell, seek urgent help from people you know.
An online report system is available for victims of gender violence to get immediate assistance through the ‘Fiscalía’ (Prosecutor Office)
You should read our guidance: Information for Victims of Rape and Sexual Assault in Ecuador.
Quito has a Tourism Police unit with branches in the north, the old town, the airport and bus terminals. The Ministry of Tourism has a national tourist service complaints management system e-mail: denuncias@turismo.gob.ec
The Ecuador Attorney General’s Office (Fiscalía General) now has an English online tool for tourists to report robbery, theft and loss of belongings and documents (the tool is listed under ‘Denuncias online para turistas).
You can call 911 or the crime emergency line 1800-DELITO (335486) for direct assistance.
Transport safety
Zebra crossings are usually not respected by drivers throughout Ecuador. Pedestrians are recommended to exercise extra caution when crossing roads.
There is a range of options for travelling by bus throughout Ecuador. Public interstate buses operate all over Ecuador, as well as hop on hop off guided bus tours.
Since 2018 there have been numerous reports of robberies on interstate transport and at bus stations, especially Quito, Baños, Cuenca, Tena, Riobamba, Mindo and Loja tourist towns. Most incidents took place at night. Where possible you should avoid travelling by road after dark. Cases involving British nationals have been reported on various routes. Don’t store your bag in overhead luggage space or underneath your seat. Keep your valuables in a safe place, preferably in a money belt or safe inside pocket.
Avoid taking interstate buses with a reputation for stopping to pick up passengers at night as many criminals use this means to attack passengers.
The use of unregistered taxis significantly increases the risk of becoming a victim of crime. Try to book a taxi through your hotel or by calling a known radio taxi service. Where possible, try to travel in a group. If you are using an authorised taxi (yellow cab) in Quito and Guayaquil make sure it has the municipality registration number sticker displayed on the windscreen and doors; the orange license plates or the new white plates with an orange strip on the top and video cameras inside. Avoid hailing a taxi on the street, especially at night. Larger supermarkets and airports have taxi ranks.
You should only use the yellow registered taxis, with the ‘transporte seguro’ logo, if a radio taxi isn’t available.
You can also order a secure taxi from free smartphone applications such as ‘Easy Taxi,’ available for Android and iPhone. A photo, the name of the taxi driver and the vehicle description will be sent to the customer.
Local travel
There is a 20 km exclusion zone, under army control, along the entire border with Colombia. The FCDO advises against all travel to this area, except the official border crossing town of Tulcán in Carchi province. Guerrilla groups, drug traffickers and criminal gangs are active and there is a risk of kidnapping and a high risk of crime. Foreigners, including oil workers, are potential targets.
In 2018 there were serious attacks within the exclusion zone, in the northern province of Esmeraldas, including 2 bomb explosions and a kidnapping of local journalists in the San Lorenzo and Mataje areas. The Ecuadorean authorities declared these attacks to be terrorist incidents. For more details, see Terrorism
The security situation in Esmeraldas Province can change very quickly. If you’re undertaking essential travel in this area, you should pay close attention to warnings issued by the Ecuadorean authorities, be particularly cautious and vigilant, and monitor this travel advice regularly.
If you’re crossing the northern border at Tulcán (Rumichaca official land border point), you should enter and exit the town via the main Panamericana international highway. Lago Agrio (also known as Nueva Loja), the main town in the border province of Sucumbios, and San Lorenzo, in the border province of Esmeraldas, both lie within the 20km zone.
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the area bordering Colombia in Carchi province inside the 20km exclusion zone. The border area in Carchi province is home to various eco-lodges, near El Angel Ecological Reserve. Illegal armed groups and criminal gangs are present in the area. If you are travelling to this area, make sure you travel with a reputable operator with good communication systems, emergency plans in place and an official guide.
The FCDO advises against all but essential travel to the area of Tarapoa and the Cuyabeno reserve in Sucumbios. There have been instances of armed assault and kidnappings involving British Nationals in the past.
There is a high risk of violent crime in southern parts of Sucumbios province, including Coca (also known as Francisco de Orellana). There are popular eco-lodges in the area along the Napo river, between Sucumbios and Orellana provinces. Use only reputable operators to visit this area. Some lodges are a long distance from the nearest major hospital and helicopter evacuation may be necessary in an emergency. Reputable eco-lodges in this area have good communications and emergency plans in place.
Telecommunications
The Ecuadorean Ministry of Tourism and the National Telecommunications Corporation (CNT) have launched a Tourist SIM card (“travel SIM”) available for purchase for smartphones or tablets, aiming to provide tourists with various services during a 30 day period. It includes 1GB of data, free Facebook and WhatsApp, and voice call/SMS credit.
Volunteer and adventure activities
If you’re joining a volunteer or adventure expedition programme, where possible make sure the UK organisation responsible for the travel has an official local agent in Ecuador with sufficient autonomy and resources to handle an emergency situation. Be wary of unauthorised intermediaries ‘enganchadores’ trying to offer you cheap hotels or tour deals.
If you’re planning to undertake adventure activities like canopy, bungee jumping, quad biking, rafting or kayaking, make sure you are fit and healthy for the activity. Use a reputable local tour operator, properly accredited to provide this service (with a specific licence). Check that the equipment is in good condition. In addition, for water adventure sports, ensure that the weather conditions and river currents are within the advisable standards. Foreigners, including British nationals, have died undertaking canopy, rafting and kayaking activities.
Hiking and Mountaineering
Due to high altitude and unpredictable climates, if you are hiking in Ecuador, including the Galapagos Islands, you should be well prepared and sufficiently fit and healthy. Ascend at a more moderate rate to give your body some time to adjust. Stay well hydrated. Don’t stray from established paths and avoid exploring remote areas without an experienced guide. Make sure someone knows where you’re going and when you expect to be back.
The teleférico (cable car) from Quito to Pichincha volcano, which overlooks the city (at 4,050 metres above sea level), is a popular day trip from the capital. However, there have been some accidents, including fatalities from hypothermia. You should take warm and waterproof clothing, as well as high factor sun block – even on a clear day, as the weather can change quickly – and take an accredited specialised guide who knows the route well. Where possible, try to start the excursion early to minimise any potential risks related to unexpected heavy mist or storms. Tourists have been killed by electrical storms while climbing Pichincha, so you should pay close attention to the weather, and re-consider your plans if conditions look bad.
In October 2021, a significant avalanche occurred at the Chimborazo ice-capped volcano. Following the deaths of three climbers, the Ministry of Environment announced the temporary suspension of high mountaineering and climbing activities (over 5000 metres) in Chimborazo, Cayambe, Cotopaxi, Iliniza Sur and Antisana. Although theChimborazo Reserve subsequently re-opened on 1 November 2021 for tour operators and accredited mountaineering clubs, it is important to note thatofficial restrictions may be announced at short notice. If you wish to climb Chimborazo, you must register with the ‘Sistema de Información de Biodiversidad – SIB’, via email to chimborazo@ambiente.gob.ec, with a minimum of 5 days’ notice. Travellers interested in undertaking climbing or mountaineering activities are advised to monitor official channels, such as the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Tourism and Chimborazo Local Government.
Use of traditional hallucinogens
Traditional hallucinogens, often referred to as Ayahuasca or San Pedro, are found in Ecuador. These substances are often marketed to tourists as ‘spiritual cleansing’, and typically contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong hallucinogen which is illegal in the UK and many other countries. There are many risks involved with taking these substances. Consumption is not regulated. Intoxicated travellers have been assaulted and robbed, and the associated health risks are not well understood. On occasions people have suffered serious illnesses and in some cases deaths after taking these drugs, which are often taken a long way from medical facilities, thereby making the risks even greater.
Road travel
You can drive a hired car using a UK licence or International Driving Permit, but only for the first six months after you arrive in Ecuador.
Always carry your passport, driving licence, vehicle registration and proof of insurance with you when in the vehicle.
Road conditions are variable. Heavy rains and mudslides often close or wash away roads, which can cause significant delays and accidents.
Serious accidents are very common, mainly due to careless driving, speeding and badly maintained vehicles. Ecuador has one of the highest rates of road accidents in Latin America, which has led to many fatalities including of British Nationals.
If you’re a passenger in a vehicle travelling at an unsafe speed, you should firmly instruct the driver to slow down.
Where possible, avoid travelling by road outside major cities after dark. If you take public buses, check the reputation of the bus company and make sure it’s insured with a ‘SPPAT’ (formerly SOAT), mandatory traffic accident public insurance. There is an online interstate bus booking system.
When taking yellow registered taxis in the major cities make sure the taxi meter is reset. The minimum charge in Quito is US$1.45 during the day and US$1.75 at night, even if the meter registers less for your journey. If you or the hotel called a taxi, agree a price before you get in.
Rail travel
The operations of the national rail company, Tren Ecuador, are suspended until further notice.
Air travel
Quito ‘Mariscal Sucre’ International Airport is in Tababela, around 25 miles from the north-eastern part of Quito. Journey times from the airport to central Quito can vary from 30 to 60 minutes depending on the time of day.
Sea travel
There have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships in and around Ecuador’s waters. Sailors should be vigilant and take appropriate precautions.
There have been several serious accidents in the Galapagos Islands involving boats operated by tour companies. Even for short journeys, you should use reputable boat transport operators and ask about safety features before making a booking. Check that life boats and the life vests are provided before boarding.
Political situation
Street demonstrations, protests and strikes are common. Although most are peaceful, they can turn violent. You should monitor local media and avoid all large gatherings.
You should always remain vigilant, avoid any protests or demonstrations and keep up to date with developments via official local sources (ECU 911 emergency services) and this travel advice. You should also be wary of unverified, unofficial information and allow extra time to reach your destination. Check the state of roads.
