Travel in Barbados
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Barbados to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Details of these measures can be found at the Barbados Government Information Service website and the Visit Barbados Travel Protocols.
All persons arriving in Barbados are required to wear face masks at all times whilst on airport grounds. Persons will also have their temperature taken.
In moving around Barbados, follow social distancing protocols.
Masks are mandatory in all public spaces, including out-of-doors. You may also have your temperature taken when entering some premises. Regular washing of hands is encouraged and you can expect to be asked to clean your hands using hand sanitizer on entering a building.
You may be required to quarantine and/or undergo a further COVID-19 test at any stage of your stay if the Barbados authorities deem that you have been in close contact with a COVID-19 positive individual or mandatory monitoring highlights potential COVID-19 symptoms.
You should follow the Barbados Government Information Service on Facebook or on their website and monitor the Barbados Travel Protocols for further details as plans are subject to change at short notice.
The Barbadian authorities will seek to prosecute people who breach COVID-19 protocols, including those who break quarantine protocols, which may result in a fine and/or prison sentence.

Non-essential shops, bars and restaurants are closed. Supermarkets are open 8am to 4pm Monday to Friday. Beaches are open for exercise only 6am to 9am.
