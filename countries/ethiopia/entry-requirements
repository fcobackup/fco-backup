All travellers
Visas
You will need a valid visa and a valid travel document to enter Ethiopia.
Visitors must obtain a visa from the official Ethiopian e-visa platform [https://www.evisa.gov.et] or from their nearest Ethiopian Embassy before travelling. You will need to show a valid visa before boarding your flight and upon entry.
The penalty for overstaying your visa is USD10 per person per day. If you overstay you will have to pay your fine in full before you are able to leave Ethiopia. Visitors entering Ethiopia without a valid travel document and Ethiopian visa may be detained and/or fined.
Holders of valid Ethiopian Diplomatic ID Cards, Ethiopian Temporary Residents Permits or Ethiopian Origin ID (Yellow Cards) can enter without a visa.

Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Ethiopia. Make sure you have two blank pages in your passport on arrival.
