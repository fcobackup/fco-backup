If you are unwell and suspect you have symptoms of Coronavirus you can call Kyrgyzstan’s medical hotline (112, 103, 118), or the hotlines of local medical services. If you are required to enter a state quarantine centre, facilities are likely to be basic.
Some foreign nationals may be eligible to pay for and join the state medical insurance scheme. For more details see Health.

The process of issuing entry visas for the Kyrgyz republic has temporarily been suspended, and subordinate units of the State Registration Service are closed. Foreign citizens and stateless persons can stay in Kyrgyzstan until 1 June 2020 without a visa, even if registration has expired. If you need to extend your period of stay on the basis of obtaining a visa (work permit, family ties, or other grounds) the visa centre is willing to consider the possibility of obtaining visas without leaving the Kyrgyz republic. You should be aware that under the current circumstances visa processing is likely to face significant delays.
