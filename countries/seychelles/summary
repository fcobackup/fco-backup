You should exercise caution when swimming, especially with children. Currents can be strong and drownings occur. Beaches which are safer at certain times of the year can be dangerous for swimming at other times. See Swimming
There is a problem with drugs in Seychelles, in particular heroin. Crime levels have risen as a result; there has been an increase in break-ins, robberies, burglaries and opportunist thefts against residents, expatriates and tourists. There were robberies and attacks at, and around, Cote D’Or beach on the island of Praslin in late 2017. Police responded with increased foot patrols and lighting. They advise visitors to take care when walking in this area, particularly at night. You should take sensible precautions to safeguard yourself and your possessions. See Crime
