Zambia’s currency is the Kwacha and is available at airports, hotels, ATMs and exchange offices. Major credit cards are increasingly accepted by larger shops, hotels, restaurants and tour operators. Many companies charge a 5% fee for the use of credit cards. Make sure credit cards are swiped no more than necessary and that all carbons are destroyed. Only use reputable banks and bureaux de change to exchange money or use ATMs.
