From 4 July, Hungary is exempt from the FCO advice against all non-essential international travel. This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Travel is subject to entry restrictions
UK nationals (including those holding Hungarian Permanent Residence Card or a Registration Certificate and Address Card) who wish to enter Hungary for exceptional reasons, or transit through Hungary, must submit an application for exemption on the official website of the Hungarian Police by completing an electronic form
Anyone entering Hungary following this application route will undergo a medical check. If you show no symptoms of COVID-19 on arrival, you still need to follow a 14-day quarantine rule. If you show signs of COVID-19, entry will be rejected
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.

There are occasional political demonstrations in Budapest and elsewhere in the country. Some take place on or close to important national holidays with a political relevance, such as 15 March (anniversary of 1848 Revolution) and 23 October (anniversary of 1956 anti-Soviet Uprising). Peaceful political demonstrations have occasionally ended in violence. You should avoid all political demonstrations, monitor the media coverage of local events and be aware of your surroundings at all times.
Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Hungary, attacks can’t be ruled out. See Terrorism
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
