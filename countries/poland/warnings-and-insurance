Ukraine and Poland border
The FCDO advises against all travel to Ukraine. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is ongoing, with attacks against a number of major cities. Russian military strikes have taken place in Ukraine within 20km of the Polish border. There is a real risk to life. Do not attempt to cross into Ukraine from Poland. See safety and security.
