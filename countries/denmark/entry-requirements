Check your passport and travel documents before you travel
If you are visiting Denmark, check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are a resident in Denmark, you must travel with relevant documents - a valid passport, health insurance card, residence permit, residence card, EU registration certificate or personal identification document with proof of address.
Passport validity
If you are planning to travel to an EU country (except Ireland), or Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino or Vatican City, you must follow the Schengen area passport requirements.
Your passport must be:
Issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)
valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’)
You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.
Contact the embassy of the country you are visiting if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.
Visas
You can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
If you are travelling to Denmark and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
To stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Danish government’s entry requirements. Check with the Danish Authorities what type of visa, if any, you will need.
If you are travelling to Denmark for work, read the guidance on visas and permits.
If you stay in Denmark with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Visas for Greenland and Faroe Islands
Greenland and the Faroe Islands are not members of the European Union. You don’t need a visa to enter for tourism, but you should get a work and residence permit before entry if you intend to live and work there.
Border controls
The Danish authorities have border controls at the land border with Germany. There are also border controls for travellers from Rønne, Helsingør, Frederikshavn, Grenaa and those using the Øresund Bridge, including all train traffic from Sweden.
If you’re arriving in Denmark using the land border, or by rail, road, or ferry you should carry your passport with you. Allow additional time for crossing the border, and follow the instructions of local authorities.
Check with local media, your carrier, ferry operator or Danish State Railways (DSB) for more information.
ID for travel from Denmark to Sweden
If you’re travelling from Denmark to Sweden various forms of ID are accepted. These must include a photograph, the holder’s full name, social security number or date of birth, holders signature, a stated validity and information on the issuing authority. Children under 18 accompanied by an adult with the appropriate ID are not required to carry ID themselves.
Passport stamping
Check your passport is stamped if you enter or exit the Schengen area through Denmark as a visitor. Border guards will use passport stamps to check you’re complying with the 90-day visa-free limit for short stays in the Schengen area. If relevant entry or exit stamps are not in your passport, border guards will presume that you have overstayed your visa-free limit.
You can show evidence of when and where you entered or exited the Schengen area, and ask the border guards to add this date and location in your passport. Examples of acceptable evidence include boarding passes and tickets.
You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are resident in Denmark, read our Living in Denmark guide for passport stamping information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
If you have lost your passport UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Denmark. Your ETD must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.
