JetBlue Airways are currently operating a limited number of flights from Providenciales to JFK Airport, New York, including on 23 and 30 May 2020.
Provo Air Center is currently taking expressions of interest from UK, EU, US, and Canadian citizens in Providenciales who would like to return home via shared charter flights. Those interested in potential flights, either directly to the UK, or to connect with commercial flights from the USA or elsewhere, should send contact information, preferred destination and details of your party to debby@provoaircenter.com. Other charter operators may also offer similar services.
Please check the travel advice and border regulations for any country that you plan to transit through on the way back to the UK before departing Turks and Caicos.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
