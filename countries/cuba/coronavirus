Visa extensions and departure
During the period of Cuban government coronavirus measures, visa extension requirements were suspended while immigration offices have had limited services. If you were unable to renew your visa until now, all types of visas that have expired during Coronavirus measures will remain valid for 30 days after the suspension on commercial flights is lifted, i.e. 30 days from 15 November 2020.
If you have dual British and Cuban nationality, you are subject to Cuban measures. From 1 April 2020, dual nationals required permission (from Cuban Immigration offices) to leave Cuba on the special repatriation and humanitarian flights. That is no longer a requirement but could be re-introduced if the Cuban authorities implement any new measures.

Travel and transport within each Province varies according to the measures in place. The suspension of inter-provincial transport was lifted on 19 October 2020. The current exceptions are to/from Sancti Spiritus and Pinar del Rio. Any change in the situation in a province or municipality may mean inter-provincial or municipal transport links also change.
