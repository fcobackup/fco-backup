There are currently only occasional charter flights which allow a return to the UK, via third countries. The UK government is working closely with airlines to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK.
Flights
The British Embassy is aware that a number of applications for international flights from Laos have been submitted: decisions on approval are expected from the Lao Government in the near future. The Embassy will continue to post updates about new commercial routes as soon as they become known to us. If flights are fully booked, consider registering an expression of interest for future flights.
