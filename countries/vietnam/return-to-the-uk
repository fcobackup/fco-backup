If you live in the UK and are currently visiting Vietnam you’re strongly advised to return now by commercial means. Don’t run the risk of getting stranded. UK special charter flights will only operate for priority countries where commercial flights are not possible. You should not assume that these flights will become available in countries where commercial routes are operating.
International flights
The only remaining international flight option of departure from Vietnam is via South Korea by Korean Air and Asiana Airlines with onward flights by Korean Air and BA. Please check with the airlines and/or travel agents for up to date information.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Travelling to the airport
There are currently very limited, or in some cases no, taxis or Grab taxis available to take you to international airports in Vietnam. We understand that private hire cars are still allowed to take passengers to airports.
If you’re concerned about getting to the airports in Hanoi & HCMC in light of travel restrictions, we are able to provide you with a letter to facilitate your travel. If you need this letter, please contact us immediately at support@fcowebmail.fco.gov.uk with the following details, including for any British nationals accompanying you: full names (on passport), current location in Vietnam, and confirmed flight details.
Accessing departure airports
There are now severe restrictions on internal flight routes, with limited availability only remaining on three routes: Hanoi-HCMC, Hanoi-Danang, and HCMC-Danang. From 6 April, there are also restrictions on the number of passengers able to fly per day to HCMC.
Road and rail options are also increasingly restricted, and travel between Vietnamese provinces might not be as straightforward as normal.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
