You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information on emergency loans for commercial flights, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO. If you need to discuss financial assistance for other departure options please call the British Embassy on +57 1 326 8300.
Travel to the airport
To facilitate the departure of British nationals on any possible future commercial or humanitarian flight, when travel arrangements are confirmed, the British embassy will obtain the necessary transport permits from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Colombia. We will confirm these details with you separately once flight registration has closed.
Your journey home
The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
