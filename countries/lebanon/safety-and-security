Political situation
Lebanon faces serious economic, financial and political challenges. Protests which began on 17 October 2019 are ongoing and have picked up again as of May 2020. The protests have centred on Beirut and Tripoli, but have occurred at various locations nationwide, often with little notice. Violent confrontations between protestors, security forces and supporters of political groups have occurred, including major clashes in downtown Beirut, which resulted in large numbers of casualties and the widespread use of tear gas and rubber bullets by the security forces, and clashes in Tripoli, which resulted in the death of a number of protestors.
Violence between the security forces and protestors is highly likely to reoccur, including at short notice, in particular at existing flashpoints. You should remain vigilant, avoid protests, demonstrations and large political gatherings, and keep up to date with developments via this travel advice and local media, including:
TV: LBCI, New TV, NBN, Future News, OTV
Radio: Radio One 105.5 FM, Voice of Lebanon 93.3 FM, Radio Orient 88.3- 88.6 FM, Sawt El Ghad 97.1- 96.7 FM, BBC Arabic 93.1 FM
News websites: Naharnet, Now Lebanon, The Daily Star Lebanon (all in English), BBC Arabic, Elnashra and Tayyar (all in Arabic)
As a result of the protests, major roads in and out of Beirut and across the country have become blocked at short notice, including the roads to and from Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport. See Coronavirus for current restrictions on flights. If you’re travelling to or from the airport, check your flight status before leaving, allow extra time for your journey and ensure that you have adequate medical supplies if required. If roads from the airport are blocked, wait there until the authorities confirm access roads are open.
Fuel stations continue to supply petrol, but there have been closures at short notice. Road closures or road blocks may happen without warning.
The economic situation may affect your ability to pay for goods and services. As of spring 2020, the value of the Lebanese Pound has fallen rapidly against the US Dollar. Prices have increased accordingly. Banks have closed for long periods during the protests, and have increasingly become the target of attacks. While ATMs are generally stocked with Lebanese Pounds, there may be limits on daily withdrawals so check with your bank before travelling. It is very difficult to access US Dollars locally. And some companies are becoming increasingly reluctant to accept credit/debit cards so you should ensure that you have adequate cash.
Medical supplies may become increasingly scarce. You should therefore bring any medicines you need with you to Lebanon.
Security situation
The security situation in Lebanon can deteriorate quickly. As well as ongoing protests, Lebanese issues or regional and international developments can have an impact on the local security situation This includes a conflict with Israel, which could spark with little warning with a rapid escalation in violence. Events in Syria and Iraq may also impact Lebanon. You are therefore advised to monitor the regional situation whilst in Lebanon.
You should avoid large crowds and political gatherings. Weapons are common in Lebanon and groups, including Hizballah, retain arms that are beyond state control. Violence can therefore quickly escalate. There have been protests targeted at UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon. Celebratory gunfire into the air is common throughout Lebanon, including in response to speeches and messages by political leaders. If you find yourself in an area where there’s celebratory gunfire, take cover in a building and move away from windows.
In the event of widespread disturbances or a deterioration in the security situation, there may be limits to the assistance that the British Embassy Beirut can provide. Read further information and advice on how to deal with a crisis overseas.
Crime
The risk to tourists from petty or violent crime remains moderate - however crime has increased due to the declining economic situation. There is a risk of vehicle crime and bag snatching. Take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings.
There have been incidents of armed robberies and physical attacks against passengers in shared taxis (known locally as service taxis) with passengers being attacked by either the driver or other passengers. Don’t use shared taxis or taxis hailed on the street. Only use taxis from recognised companies. Hotels can advise on firms with cars that are recognised as being safe and well maintained. 
In December 2017, the Lebanese Interior Minister advised people in Lebanon not to use Uber taxis, saying “I call in your name on all Lebanese not to use this Uber transport service because we do not consider it to be safe and there are taxi offices to use instead”.
There are reports of criminal gangs operating in parts of the Beqaa Valley, especially northern Beqaa, involved in drug cultivation and smuggling. There are frequent armed clashes between gangs, and operations by the security forces. You should follow the advice of security agencies, and be particularly conscious of your security if travelling in northern Beqaa.
Local travel
The government may restrict movements, including at short notice, to control the spread of coronavirus. See information on measures introduced in Lebanon.
Ongoing protests and roadblocks may mean that travel is restricted at short notice. See Political Situation above.
There have been clashes in recent years between Lebanese security forces and militants in Tripoli and in areas north of there, including in Minyeh and Banine resulting in civilians, soldiers and militants being killed and/or injured.
Palestinian refugee camps are volatile environments where the Lebanese state has limited capacity to impose law and order. There has been a long pattern of violent clashes in particular in Ein El Helweh camp near Saida in southern Lebanon.
There is a UN peacekeeping presence in the area south of the Litani River. Although de-mining operations have been carried out unexploded ordnance, including cluster bombs, remain in remote areas.
There is a military checkpoint located approximately 7km south of Tyre on the Naqoura-Tyre-Saida-Beirut highway. A pass from the LAF office in Saida is necessary to continue your journey further south towards the Israeli border. However, as the office is located in an area of Saida to which the FCO advise against all but essential travel, you should carefully consider whether your need for a pass is essential before you travel.
Land mines are present in Lebanon and are not always clearly marked. Use only well-travelled tracks and do not stray from their edges. Avoid remote abandoned properties. Use local guides and seek local knowledge if you’re unsure.
Road travel
The government may restrict movements, including at short notice, to control the spread of coronavirus. See information on measures introduced in Lebanon. Roads, including the Beirut airport road, are subject to closure without notice. Following a decision from the Ministry of Interior, motorcycles in Beirut are banned from 4:59 pm until 6am. See Political Situation above.
You must hold either an International Driving Permit (IDP), which must be certified by the Lebanese authorities on arrival, or a temporary local licence to drive in Lebanon. Temporary local licences are likely to be more time consuming and expensive than an IDP.
Driving standards are poor and the accident rate is high. Traffic lights are not always observed. It may be better to hire a car with a driver if you’re inexperienced. You must wear a seat belt (if fitted). Avoid travelling at night outside towns if possible. Vehicles with diesel engines are banned.
Carry ID with you at all times and be prepared to stop at check points to show your papers. The army have set up check points on major and minor roads.
