The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
Future travel options
If you cannot leave Cameroon at this time, see advice on staying in Cameroon during coronavirus.
A number of chartered repatriation flights organised by foreign governments have successfully left Cameroon and there may be further flights arranged. There are occasionally places available on these for British nationals.
Information about these flights is generally only available at short notice therefore you should e-mail ConsularYaoundeEnquiries@fco.gov.uk with your full name, date of birth, passport number, telephone number, address in the UK and e-mail address if you are seeking to leave Cameroon.

Help and support
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
If you need urgent consular assistance, you can contact the British High Commission on +44 207 008 1500 / +237 222220545.
The High Commission cannot provide further information or advice about departure options over the phone. This page will be updated when UK and commercial departure options become available. To get the latest information, sign up for travel advice email alerts.
