On 14 March the Latvian Government announced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus. This means that:
British nationals are permitted to exit Latvia at designated land border crossing points, but there is no guarantee of onward travel.
The international transit of passengers through airports and ports, by bus and rail, is suspended.
The movement of passengers and vehicles through border crossing points at airports and ports, on road and railway lines at the external border of the European Union is prohibited. This also applies to border crossing points intended for local border traffic, with the exception of the carriage of goods.
From 17 March, following measures taken by Latvia and neighbouring countries, there are limited commercial means of leaving Latvia to return to the UK.
An exceptional commercial flight operated by Air Baltic flew from Riga to London Gatwick on the morning of 20 March. Air Baltic has announced further exceptional commercial flights from Riga to London Gatwick for 21, 22, 24 and 25 March. British Nationals should go to the Air Baltic website for further details.
