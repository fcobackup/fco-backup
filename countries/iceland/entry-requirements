The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Due to COVID-19 restrictions, from 1 January 2021 all non-essential travel by British citizens from the UK/other non EU/EEA country to Iceland is not permitted, unless you are resident in Iceland or fall under their exempt category of traveller.
Most passengers flying into Iceland must present a negative PCR taken within 72 hours of their time of departure to Iceland. Followed by two COVID-19 tests, one on arrival and another 5-6 days later. From 1 April 2021, children born in 2005 or later will also need to have a PCR test at the border. If they test positive, they will have to stay in isolation. If they are travelling with parents or guardians who are required to quarantine children must also stay in quarantine with them.
From 1 April 2021, everyone who arrives from, or has in the previous 14 days stayed in, areas that are classified as dark red or grey, must stay in managed quarantine facilities. Preparing for your return journey to the UK
If you’re returning to the UK from overseas, you will need to: provide your journey and contact details before you travel.
If your return journey to the UK transits another country, you should check whether it is subject to a travel ban or any other additional requirements. If so, contact your travel provider.
Entry to Iceland
All non-essential travel by British citizens from the UK/other non EU/EEA country to Iceland is not permitted, unless it falls under one of their exempt categories for travel.
You must also fill in a pre-registration form before departure.
If you do not have an acceptable certificate then some essential travel is still permitted. A full list of accepted essential travel can be found here.
These restrictions do not apply to UK nationals who are legally resident in Iceland and you will be allowed to re-enter the country. If you are a resident, then you are strongly advised to have a C-122 residence certificate with you at the airport to avoid issues at check-in.
Passengers arriving without a valid certificate of previous COVID-19 infection or of vaccination approved by the Icelandic Authorities need to present a negative PCR test result taken within 72 hours of their time of departure to Iceland. Failure to do so can result in a ISK 100,000 fine for residents or a refusal of entry for visitors. This is followed on arrival by two COVID-19 tests. The first, on actual arrival at the airport/port and another 5-6 days later. The arrival tests can be booked in advance. Between these tests, you must follow quarantine measures until you know the result of the second test.
Passengers submitting a vaccination certificate or certificate of prior infection will only be required to have a test on arrival and follow quarantine measures until the result is known (usually within 24hrs).
From 1 April children born in 2005 or later will also need to have a PCR test at the border. If they test positive, they will have to stay in isolation. If they are travelling with parents or guardians who are required to quarantine children must also stay in quarantine with them. These measures will significantly affect what you can and cannot do on arrival. If you have booked a trip to Iceland you should contact your tour operator and travel insurer about what this means for you and your plans.
You may be required to isolate in a state managed facility if the first border test is positive and you are unable to provide credible plans for your isolation arrangements. You may also be put into a state managed facility if infected with a virus strain classed by the authorities as particularly worrisome in terms of contagion and morbidity. From 1 April everyone who arrives from, or has in the previous 14 days stayed in, areas that are classified as dark red or grey, must stay in managed quarantine facilities.
Note that the airport bus from Keflavik to Reykjavik has been temporarily suspended and persons travelling to Iceland may not be picked up at the airport. This includes family members and friends. Arrivals to Iceland must either take a taxi, a rental car or a private car that has been dropped off at the airport and this can be expensive (approx ISK 18,000/£100 one way).
Data collection
Upon arrival you will be encouraged to sign up to the contact tracing app Rakning C-19. Further information, including how to download it, data usage, privacy and scope is available on the Rakning C-19 website.
Testing / screening on arrival
If you test positive on arrival you will be required to enter self-isolation (at your hotel or government-provided accommodation) unless further tests determine the infection is inactive.
You may also need to be tested again or enter self-isolation if you are exposed to a possible infection during your trip eg during the flight to Iceland.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Iceland and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Icelandic entry requirements. Check with the Icelandic Directorate of Immigration what type of visa and/or work permit you may need.
if you stay in Iceland with a visa or permit, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
Any time you spent in Iceland or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Icelandic border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
If you are a British resident in Iceland, you are advised to obtain a letter confirming your status from Registers Iceland. Our Living in Guide contains more information.
Passport validity
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Iceland.
