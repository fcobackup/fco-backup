Travel in Thailand
Domestic travel options within Thailand are available but remain subject to disease control measures. These may include restrictions on movement between provinces.
If you are taking an internal flight in Thailand, you may be asked to download an app or complete additional travel documentation.
You will be required to wear a face mask and follow other disease control measures when using public transport, including planes, trains, buses and taxis. In some provinces public transport may stop earlier than normal.
COVID-related restrictions in Thailand
An emergency decree is currently in place. This includes instructions that you must not:
enter high risk areas
hoard essential goods
attend public gatherings
propagate false information
Until further notice you must also wear a mask in all indoor and outdoor public spaces in Thailand and in vehicles if you are with others. If you do not wear a mask you may have to pay a fine.
The Thai government also advises that you should avoid unnecessary travel and crowded places, and scan the ‘Thai Chana’ QR code where available.
A number of disease control measures at national and local levels are also in place. These include a colour rating for each of Thailand’s 76 provinces based on the number of COVID-19 cases. Restrictions in each province and for movement between provinces depend on the colour rating and any additional local rules, and they may change at any time.
In some provinces measures may include restrictions on dining in restaurants, gathering in groups, closures of shops and curfews. You are advised to strictly follow preventative and disease control measures to minimise risks and avoid penalties.
Measures change frequently. You should check with local authorities and the Thai government’s PR website and Facebook page on the current situation.
Accommodation
Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Thailand. However, some hotels remain closed so we advise you to contact hotels directly when booking.
The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to provide information on your recent travel history and any symptoms you may have related to COVID-19. You may also need to follow other disease control measures.
Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities.

If you think you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should call the Thai COVID-19 Hotline on 1422.
If you need a COVID-19 test, Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health has compiled a list of private and government-managed testing facilities. You should contact the Ministry for further information.
If you test positive for COVID-19, Thai public health regulations require that you quarantine at either a hospital, hospitel (a repurposed hotel with medical capabilities) or field hospital, depending on the severity of your symptoms. This includes anyone who is asymptomatic. You should ensure that you understand your health care provider’s policies before you take a test as these will include where you quarantine and receive medical care if you test positive.
In areas designated as dark red zones there is increasing pressure on medical services. You may find it difficult to access COVID-19 testing and medical care.
There may also be specific measures in place that impact on maternity services in some hospitals, including quarantine for newborn babies and C-sections as the preferred form of delivery. In most cases, these are recommendations only but in some hospitals they are mandatory. You should ensure you understand your health care provider’s policies so you can make the choices that work best for you. The WHO has useful guidance on COVID and maternity/post-natal care.
Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Read guidance on how to look after your mental wellbeing and mental health.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Thailand
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Thailand national vaccination programme started in February 2021. Thailand is currently using the AstraZeneca and Sinovac vaccines but others may also be available. The Ministry of Public Health has confirmed that all residents of Thailand, including foreigners, can register for a vaccine at any hospital that holds your health records. Registration online and at hospitals that do not hold your records may also be possible. Short and longer-term visitors may not be eligible under this scheme.
In many areas of Thailand there are limited supplies of vaccines and registration and vaccination programmes have been temporarily suspended.
If you are a British national living in Thailand, you should seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider. Information about COVID-19 vaccines used in the national programme where you live, including regulatory status, should be available from local authorities.
You can also receive the Embassy’s regular updates about the vaccination programme by sending a message to Bangkok.DocumentaryServices@fcdo.gov.uk.
Find out more, including about the vaccines that are authorised in the UK or approved by the World Health Organisation, on the COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad webpage.
