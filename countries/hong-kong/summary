In recent weeks, several large-scale political demonstrations have taken place on Hong Kong Island, in Kowloon and various suburbs in the New Territories. Clashes have taken place between police and protesters following otherwise peaceful protest activities. These have involved significant violence. Reports indicate the protests are likely to continue, including:
Chater Gardens, Central (Hong Kong Island) on 16 August between 20:00-22:00 local time; and
Victoria Park to Chater Road (Hong Kong Island) on 18 August from 15:00 onwards
Major protests took place inside Hong Kong International Airport from 9 to 13 August, which led to flight cancellations and disruption to check-in services. Violent clashes between some protesters and the police took part in the terminal buildings on 13 August. There is a chance of further (potentially unannounced) protests taking place in, or on the approach to, the airport. Passengers should therefore check their flight status and the latest information on the Hong Kong International Airport website, and pay attention to local media, before travelling to the airport. Passengers affected by recent disruption should contact their airlines for the latest information and for alternative flight arrangements. Hundreds of flights were cancelled at Hong Kong International Airport on Monday 12 and Tuesday 13 August, which continues to affect flight availability in and out of Hong Kong.
You should be prepared that the situation around protests and public gatherings could change quickly, with the potential for significant violence. If you are in and around areas where demonstrations are taking place, you should remain vigilant, follow the advice of local authorities and move away quickly to a safe place if there are signs of disorder.
Some protests may not have received authorisation from the police. Unauthorised protests have become more frequent and widespread, affecting many areas across Hong Kong, including some areas popular with tourists on Hong Kong Island, in Kowloon and on Lantau Island (where Hong Kong International Airport is located). Compared to authorised protests, unauthorised protests are met by a more rapid and more severe police response. Recent unauthorised protests have attracted heavy use of tear gas, including in built up and residential areas. You should therefore exercise vigilance in the vicinity of unauthorised protests.
Activities related to protests - including the firing of tear gas - have spilled over into large public spaces, including shopping centres, housing estates and metro (“MTR”) stations, on the margins of recent protests. Protests can deviate from planned routes or rally locations; there is the possibility of injuries among those accidentally caught up in events. Demonstrations may lead to sections of the city being closed off and strikes by public transport workers will significantly disrupt services. In recent protests, bus routes, MTR stations, the Airport Express and the Hong Kong Macao Ferry Terminal have temporarily suspended operations without warning.
On 20 July, Hong Kong police announced that they had seized a quantity of explosives and offensive weapons in the New Territories and that they were still investigating the motive.
