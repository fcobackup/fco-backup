In response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, passengers (except Turkish nationals or residents of Turkey) who have transited through or have been in the UK or other countries on which the Turkish authorities have imposed a direct flight ban in the past 14 days are not allowed to transit or enter Turkey.
Options for leaving Turkey are becoming increasingly limited and if you wish to leave Turkey you should make arrangements to do so as soon as possible.
As of the 25th March there are no direct repatriation flights scheduled from Turkey to the UK; the last direct repatriation flight left on March 24th. Indirect routes are still operating. Given the speed of developments, you should check carefully any transit restrictions or requirements before starting your journey and contact individual airlines to check availability.
From 27 March, Turkish Airlines will only operate flights to five locations: Hong Kong, Moscow, Addis Ababa, New York and Washington.
You will not be allowed to leave the airside area when transiting Turkey. If transiting Turkey with hold luggage you should ensure that both sections of your flights are with airlines which are part of the same airline alliance group and booked on one ticket. You cannot enter Turkey to collect hold luggage from one flight to be re-checked in on another. Those without hold luggage (just hand luggage) should still be able to transit on two separate tickets, as you do not have to leave the airside area.
You should check with your airline before travelling.
All passengers holding Turkish residence permits entering Turkey who have been in a banned country in the preceding 14 days will be tested on arrival for COVID-19. A positive test will lead to the passenger going straight to a government-run quarantine facility. A negative test will lead to mobility restrictions â€“ either self-isolation or full quarantine for 14 days. Land crossings with Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, Iran and Iraq have also been closed.
For the latest information about flight availability, please refer to the most recent social media updates from the Consul General in Istanbul.
