The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to Haiti due to the volatile security situation.
Before you travel, check the ‘Entry requirements’ section for Haiti’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.
If you plan to pass through another country to return to the UK, check the travel advice for the country you’re transiting.
It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the FCDO’s guidance on foreign travel insurance.
