The Dominican Republic government has closed the country’s borders and all international flights have been suspended except “ferry flights” to repatriate foreign nationals.
The last direct ferry flight from the Dominican Republic to the UK departed on Thursday 19 March. Some airlines continue to fly limited routes back to the UK via third countries: in some cases you may need to book this as two separate flights. Travellers should regularly check availability with their travel agent, travel websites and directly with airlines. You will need to meet the entry or transit conditions for any third country that you travel through. Check with your travel providers regularly, as connection availability can change without notice.
British Nationals are currently able to travel to the UK via the United States and Canada from the Dominican Republic, providing they hold a valid ESTA (US) or ETA (Canada). You should consult the ESTA and ETA pages to check individual eligibility. Passengers must have an onward ticket to the UK in order to transit either country. This ticket must be for a flight departing from the same airport as entry and leave no more than 24 hours after arrival. If travelling via the US, passengers must not have been physically present in Europe, China or Iran in the past 14 days. To check available routes, please consult with airlines, travel providers or flight tracking websites and applications, such as Flightradar24.com, which provide live flight statuses. You should then contact a relevant airline to make a booking. Carriers reserve the right to deny boarding to any individual exhibiting symptoms of coronavirus.
Where possible, the British Embassy in the Dominican Republic will share further relevant information about departure options on Facebook and Twitter.
You should contact your airline, tour operator and travel insurer to find out what support they can offer.
The FCO provides information on what to do and who to contact if you require financial assistance abroad.
