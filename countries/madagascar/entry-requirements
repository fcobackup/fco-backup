The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory to which you’re travelling are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unsure about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you should contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory to which you’re travelling.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)
Madagascar has suspended all routine international flights and private flights until further notice. Cruise ships are not currently permitted to berth in Madagascar’s ports.
To enter Madagascar you will need to provide proof of a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of travel. You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
You will also be required to take a test at Ivato International Airport and to self-isolate at your own expense until the test result is received (typically 4 – 5 days). If the test is positive, you may be required to go to a state-mandated facility for treatment.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
You can buy a 30, 60 or 90-day tourist visa on arrival at the airport in cash using US$, Euros, or Malagasy Ariary.
Alternatively, you can apply for an e-visa on the official Malagasy e-visa website before you travel.
You will be asked for evidence of onward or return travel at check-in and on arrival in Madagascar.
Make sure an entry stamp is recorded in your passport, and that your visa is valid for the period and purpose of your journey. A tourist visa cannot be extended beyond 90 days. Overstaying may lead to detention and deportation.
Passport validity
Your passport must have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of entry into Madagascar. You should have at least 2 blank pages in your passport on arrival.
Airport security fee
Airport security tax has been imposed since 1 March 2014. This tax is normally included in the ticket fare.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Madagascar.
Travelling with children
Children already in possession of a visa don’t need further parental approval to enter Madagascar. A parent leaving Madagascar alone with a child must carry written authorisation from the absent parent.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
