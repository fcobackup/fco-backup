This page has information on travelling to Morocco.
This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Morocco set and enforce entry rules. If you’re unsure how Morocco’s entry requirements apply to you, contact its UK embassy, high commission or consulate.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Entry and borders
The Moroccan Government re-opened the borders for commercial flights into and out of Morocco on 7 February.
All passengers are required to download, print and sign a passenger health form before arrival in Morocco.
Random rapid antigen tests will be conducted upon arrival for selected groups of passengers. Additional PCR tests may also be required after 48 hours of arrival for randomly selected passengers.
Specific measures will be put in place for positive COVID-19 cases, including isolation at the passengers’ place of residence. More serious cases would be transferred to hospital.
The Moroccan government also re-opened its maritime borders for ferry services on 8 April. The borders with Ceuta and Melilla were re-opened on 17 May.
Travellers transiting through third countries should ensure they consult FCDO Travel Advice for that country for the latest COVID-19 related travel and transit guidance.
British nationals in Morocco who require consular assistance should call the British Embassy on + 212 (0) 537 63 33 33 and follow the voice menu for “option 4 for consular assistance”.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 status
Morocco will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record at the border. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
For details on how to demonstrate your COVID-19 status in domestic settings in Morocco, see the Coronavirus page.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
British nationals don’t need a visa to enter Morocco for the purpose of tourism for up to 3 months.
When entering the country, make sure your passport is stamped. Some tourists have experienced difficulties leaving the country because their passport bears no entry stamp.
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay in Morocco. However, the Moroccan Consulate General in London advise that your passport should be valid for at least 3 months on your date of entry to Morocco. If your passport does not meet this requirement you may face difficulties and you should check with the Moroccan authorities and your travel provider before travelling.
Before travelling, make sure your passport isn’t damaged. Some travellers have been refused entry when travelling on damaged passports.
Moroccan citizens who reside in the UK and travel to Morocco, may not be allowed to return to the UK unless they present evidence of their UK immigration status. This can include their UK biometric residence permit card or a valid UK entry clearance.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry to, airside transit, and exit from, Morocco. Stolen or lost British passports in Morocco should be reported to local police, who should provide you with a written report. This may need to be shown to airport authorities if you plan to leave Morocco on an Emergency Travel Document.
