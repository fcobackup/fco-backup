This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Afghanistan as a visitor, if you are unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Afghanistan to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Afghanistan
On 28 March, restrictions came into effect in Kabul limiting movement. These include halting all public buses carrying more than 4 people, closing wedding halls and shrines, with only critical services including food shops remaining open. Travel to and from Kabul to other provinces in Afghanistan has also been stopped. You will need to give a valid reason (such as medical, security or caring for someone) for leaving your residence if asked by the authorities. Keep checking local media for the most up to date information on restrictions.
Health
If you are in Afghanistan and displaying symptoms of coronavirus, you should seek medical advice while self-isolating. The advice from the Afghan Ministry of Public Health is that if you are displaying symptoms, call 166 and they will guide you on what to do next. Please note the advisors only speak Dari (press option 1) or Pashto (option 2). You should also contact your insurance or medical assistance company.
