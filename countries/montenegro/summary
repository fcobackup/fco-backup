If you’re eligible to enter Montenegro, you may need to self-isolate for a period of 14 days, or go into quarantine in state-arranged accommodation, if you are displaying symptoms of coronavirus or have had contact with those who are displaying symptoms. Decisions will be made at the discretion of sanitary inspectors.
