There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Guyana.
The Government of Guyana have announced the cancellation of all international flights from Cheddi Jagan International Airport at Timehri and the Eugene Correia Airport at Ogle. The closure started on 17 March 2020 and is scheduled to last for the foreseeable future. Some repatriation charter flights are being allowed to leave Guyana.
Since many countries in the region have closed their borders, only Barbados has had direct flights to the United Kingdom. The High Commission had previously managed to secure charter flights to connect with them, however these direct flights to the UK from Barbados have now stopped. There will therefore be no further charter flights to Barbados until further notice. If you are a British National in Guyana or Suriname and wish to leave, you should contact the British High Commission by email returnfrom.guyana@fco.gov.uk, who will inform you as soon as departure options become available.
The Governments of Brazil and Suriname have both announced the closure of borders with neighbouring countries, including Guyana. There is no exit/entry available to Venezuela.
What to do
Travellers should regularly check availability of flights with the airlines. You should also check the travel advice for any country that you will transit on the way back to the UK. You should find secure accommodation until you are able to make your way back the UK. To build a more accurate picture of the number of non-resident British nationals still in Guyana, and the issues you are currently facing, we would ask all those with an interest in returning to the UK to email returnfrom.guyana@fco.gov.uk providing the following information:
Your full name(s);
Your passport details;
Date of expiry of passport;
Your date(s) of birth;
Place of birth (as shown on your passport);
Your exact current location in Guyana;
Details of the best way to contact you.
If you are catching an exceptional flight please leave plenty of time to get to the airport and make sure you have the following documents (printed where possible):
Proof of a booked flight (ideally a boarding pass);
Your passport.
If you cannot leave Guyana at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus;
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs;
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well.
