Upon arrival in South Africa, you will need to produce a paper copy of a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) COVID-19 test to border officials. The test must have taken place no more than 72 hours before your departure. It should be conducted by a certified medical practitioner, and should have the name and signature of the practitioner who conducted the test. We advise that you carry several paper copies of your test, as you may need to present it more than once on your journey.
If you do not have a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, you may have to quarantine in a government-appointed quarantine facility, at your own cost.
You will need to complete and produce an online travel health questionnaire on your personal device before arriving in South Africa. The questionnaire is available from the South Africa Department of Health
