Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Cuba since 11 March 2020. The Cuban authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The Cuban Government made important announcements on 20 and 23 March of measures to counter the spread of coronavirus in Cuba. There are significant implications for tourists and foreign residents. Some of the detail is still not clear and the British Embassy in Havana is urgently seeking clarifications on some issues from the Cuban authorities.
Entry and borders
From Monday 23 March (midnight), only Cuban nationals and foreign residents of Cuba will be allowed to enter Cuba. All will be put in government-managed isolation accommodation for 14 days. This measure applies for 30 days and is subject to review. Returning residents will be taken to their province of residence.
Arrivals who have been in or are travelling directly from a country deemed to be of high risk for coronavirus may have their temperature taken upon arrival, and may be taken to a clinic or hospital in Havana to be tested and monitored.
International airlines are permitted to come to Cuba with Cuban nationals and foreign residents and leave with passengers without symptoms/coronavirus. International flight services are busy and are being reduced and suspended. Customers should follow up with their tour operator or airline as a matter of urgency and research other options.

Measures for tourists
Tourists staying in hotels will be confined to those hotels until it is time for them to depart. They cannot leave the hotel unless to go to the aiport. All excursions are suspended. A medic will visit the hotel twice per day.
Tourists can only stay in authorised casas particulars (private houses), and must stay in the house. Some tourists will be moved from private houses to government hotels in the coming days (starting in Baracoa, Trinidad and Vinales). The government will cover the transport. The cost of the hotel will be similar to the private house.
All discos, nightclubs, gymnasiums, etc (government or private owned for public access, and in hotels) will be closed.
Restaurants and bars will be restricting services, working hours and seating (there must be two metres between tables).
Camp sites will be closed.
Tourists can only move around for essential trips and in officially authorised and licensed transport, e.g. yellow taxis for trips to the airport to catch their flight. Tourists can no longer rent cars.
Other local measures
Transport between provinces will be suspended. Urban transport services are being reviewed.
People in queues must maintain a minimum of distance of one metre between them.
There will be an increased police presence in the streets and shops, to monitor that people are following the measures.
Further information
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the Cuban immigration authorities or the nearest Cuban Embassy/Consulate. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
You should pack sanitary hand gel, handkerchiefs and other essential items that may prevent transmission, as these items are not always available in Cuba. Further information on coronavirus, including advice on preparing for foreign travel and helping reduce the spread of the virus, is available from Public Health England and on the TravelHealthPro website
