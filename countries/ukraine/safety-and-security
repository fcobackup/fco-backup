Warning
FCDO advises against all but essential travel to parts of Ukraine.

You should also read FCDO’s overall travel advice and regional risks advice.
Terrorism
There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.
UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.
Terrorism in Ukraine
Terrorist attacks in Ukraine cannot be ruled out.
Political situation
A state of emergency, put in place by the Government of Ukraine in February 2022, remains in effect, and martial law is in force throughout Ukraine.
Unexploded weapons
There is a hazard from unexploded weapons throughout Ukraine, but particularly in the South and East of the country along the current conflict frontlines, and in areas where ground fighting occurred (particularly since 2022). Drone and missile strikes occur frequently across Ukraine and can deposit unexploded weapons in public areas. This includes cluster munitions, which scatter round the landing site and can cause delayed explosions. Flooding in the Kherson Oblast, following the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in June 2023, spread unexploded weapons across the region.
If you come across an unexploded weapon, such as a landmine, do not approach it or touch it. Make a note of where you saw it and notify the authorities on 101. Beware of more unexploded weapons nearby.
Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant
Explosions continue to be reported near the area of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant indicating ongoing military activity. There have been no reports of any radiation release.
Crime
Before the full-scale invasion, serious crime against foreigners was relatively rare, but incidents did occur, with some cases being racially motivated.
If you are a victim of crime, report it to the police by calling 102. FCDO has a list of local translators in Ukraine. We cannot confirm whether these translators are still offering services during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Protecting your belongings
Be alert to the possibility of street crime and petty theft. Foreigners may appear to be lucrative targets.
Theft of and from vehicles is common. Do not leave documents or money in your vehicle.
Drink and food spiking
Do not leave drinks or food unattended as they could be spiked. Beware of accepting drinks from casual acquaintances.
Scams
Cloning of credit and debit cards is common. Be aware of who is around you when using ATMs and do not let your card out of your sight during transactions.
Cyber attacks
Ukraine is a target for large cyber-attacks which disrupt basic services and risk data security, including personal data.  In March 2025, a large-scale attack targeted Ukraine’s national railway operator Ukrzaliznytsia, impacting ticket purchasing.
In December 2023, there was a high-impact cyber attack on Ukrainian networks. Ukraine’s largest mobile network operator, Kyivstar, suffered a cyber attack which left users without a mobile signal or the ability to use the internet. It also disrupted air raid apps, some banks, ATMs, and point-of-sale terminals. The Ukrainian bank Monobank was also targeted, disrupting access to the bank’s website.
Laws and cultural differences
Language
Ukrainian officials generally only speak Ukrainian and Russian.
Personal ID
Carry your passport at all times to use as identification and to demonstrate your legal status in Ukraine if asked by the police. Police should identify themselves and show identification. If you’re detained because you have not been able to present your passport, ask for an official report.
Access to money
ATMs are available and credit cards are widely used in cities. However, as a result of the current invasion of Ukraine by Russia, ATMs might not be refilled with cash and some bank cards might not be accepted. During power cuts, ATMs and card terminals may not work.
Make sure you have sufficient cash in local currency. US dollars and euros are the easiest currencies to exchange in Ukraine. You may be able to exchange sterling, but in fewer places. Scottish and Northern Irish notes are not accepted. Only use official exchange booths and make sure you’re given a receipt. You’ll need to present your passport to exchange currency worth 150,000 Ukrainian hryvnia or more. You’ll need the receipt to exchange money back on departure.
There is a risk that cyber attacks could disrupt mobile, internet and banking services.
Alcohol and smoking
It is illegal to smoke or drink alcohol in public places, including on public transport, at bus stops, underground crossings, cultural, sports and governmental establishments, playgrounds and parks.
Illegal drugs and prison sentences
Penalties for being caught in possession of drugs are severe.
Using cameras in secure areas
Do not take photographs near government or military establishments.
LGBT+ travellers
Although same-sex relationships are not illegal, public attitudes are less tolerant than in the UK and showing affection in public may receive negative attention. There’s no provision under Ukrainian legislation guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Read more advice for LGBT+ travellers.
Surrogacy
Due to the security challenges across all of Ukraine, we must currently advise against commissioning any surrogacy arrangements.
Commissioning a surrogacy will not automatically mean that the child holds British citizenship. If you want to bring your child born through surrogacy from Ukraine to the UK, you must apply for a full British passport.
The FCDO cannot facilitate your departure from Ukraine.
If you are considering changing your surrogacy arrangements, or making a new arrangement with a Ukrainian woman in another country, you should read about surrogacy arrangements in foreign countries.
Transport information and risks
Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, expect disruption to travel and transport networks. Only travel if you judge it is safe to do so. We cannot confirm which services are operating. Where possible, check before travelling.
Taxis
Unregulated taxi drivers can overcharge. Use official taxis, which have the name and telephone number of the taxi company on the side of the door and on the top of the taxi.
Road travel
If you are planning to drive in Ukraine, see information on driving abroad and read the RAC’s Ukraine guide.
You must have a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) as well as your UK driving licence to drive in Ukraine. The 1949 IDP is not accepted any more. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. 
You need to carry a green card to drive in Ukraine. A green card is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad. 
You must carry original vehicle registration papers, ownership documents and insurance papers at all times. You must show them when crossing borders and if you are stopped by the police. This also applies to rental vehicles. If you do not have these papers when stopped by the police they have the right to impound your vehicle and charge you for this.
Car hire 
If you intend to rent a vehicle for your travel in Ukraine, check with the car hire company and insurance company about their policy on renting cars in Ukraine and any other country you will pass through, especially non-EU countries. Ensure they provide you with a rental agreement permitting you to cross the Ukrainian border.
Driving standards
Roads are of variable quality and routes may be affected by the ongoing invasion. Avoid night-time travel wherever possible.
Local driving standards are poor. Street lights are weak and road users often ignore speed limits, traffic lights and road signs. Drivers frequently make turns and change lane without indicating.  There are a high number of traffic accidents, including fatalities. Speeding, drink driving and infrequent use of helmets, seat belts and child restraints in vehicles are the main contributing factors.
If you have a road accident, you must wait for the police to assess the accident. Call the police on 102. Local officials generally only speak Ukrainian and Russian.
Driving regulations
It is illegal to drive with any alcohol content in your blood.
Police can stop vehicles and give fines for minor offences such as illegal parking or jumping a red light. They may carry a credit card terminal to collect payment on the spot, or fines can be paid online or at a bank within 15 days. See payment options (in Ukrainian). The police officer should give their name and rank, explain why you have been stopped and make an administrative offence report. The police may film interactions with members of the public.
Leaving Ukraine by car
You can leave Ukraine by car through most border crossing points, but Ukraine’s border crossings with Russia and Belarus are closed to regular traffic.
There could be long queues at the border crossing points with EU member states and Moldova. Have a good supply of food, water, warm clothing, medication and fuel.
The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine (SBGSU) website has a map showing the border crossing locations. The State Customs Service lists waiting times at border crossing points.
At the border crossing, the SBGSU will check:
car registration documents
the insurance documents for the vehicle (green card)
For more information see the SBGSU website or call the SBGSU hotline on 1598 from a Ukrainian mobile.
If you leave the country in a vehicle registered in the UK, which you temporarily imported to Ukraine, you will have to provide your import customs declaration when leaving.
You may need additional documents. For further information on leaving Ukraine by car, contact the State Customs Service of Ukraine (site in Ukrainian).
Rail travel
If you travel by train, make sure your belongings are secure. Do not agree to look after the luggage of a fellow traveller or allow it to be stored in your compartment.
Air travel
Ukraine’s air space is closed.
Extreme weather and natural disasters
Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.
Flooding
Floods can cause travel disruption and damage to property and infrastructure. Check weather warnings from Ukraine’s Hydrometeorological Center before travel and follow the advice of the local authorities.
