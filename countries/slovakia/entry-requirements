This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport, for the most common types of travel.
The authorities in Slovakia set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact their embassy, high commission or consulate. You may also check with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and travel documents meet their requirements.
If you are travelling to Slovakia for work, read the guidance on visas and permits as the rules have changed since 1 January 2021.
Entry rules in response to coronavirus
Entry to Slovakia
There are travel restrictions for travellers from the UK and most other countries. The Slovak Government may change its entry requirements at short notice. Direct flights from the UK are permitted, and regular services are resuming.
New entry requirements in force from 9 July
From 9 July, new entry requirements apply.
If you are travelling directly from the UK or any other non-Schengen country to Slovakia, UK nationals may only enter if you are one of the following:
a resident in Slovakia
a close relative of residents
a close relative of Slovak citizens
commercial transport personnel
a student studying in Slovakia
you fall under certain limited exemptions
The above restriction does not apply to UK nationals who enter Slovakia via the land borders with Hungary, the Czech Republic, Austria or Poland, or by air from any country in the Schengen area.
If you meet one of the criteria for entry to Slovakia (as listed above), the following entry requirements apply from 9 July.
Entry to Slovakia by air from 9 July
If you arrive in Slovakia by air, you need to complete the Slovak government’s Passenger Locator Form. You should carry a printed confirmation with you in case the airline or border officials ask to see it.
If you arrive by air from the UK or another country not listed in Annex 1 of the relevant Slovak government decree (in Slovak only), you must also be able to show a negative PCR test result no older than 72 hours, regardless of your vaccination status. Children under 12 do not need to show a negative PCR test result.
Everyone aged 12 and above arriving from all countries by all means of transport must register in advance of travel on the Slovak government’s website. After registering, you will receive a confirmation which you should show at the border and carry with you during your stay, in case the authorities ask to see it.
If you leave Slovakia and then later return, you must register separately each time you enter. However, you are exempt from this requirement to register for each subsequent visit if you:
received the first dose of a single or a two-dose vaccine (your first entry registration is valid until 9 August)
are aged 12-18 (your first entry registration is valid until 9 August)
are emergency services personnel or hold a special exemption from the Health Ministry to travel to receive treatment abroad (your first entry registration is valid for 1 week)
work in Slovakia and are either resident in an EU country, Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein, Switzerland or Ukraine (if you reside in Ukraine within 100km of the Slovak border) (your first entry registration is valid until 1 September)
are a resident in Slovakia but working in either an EU country, Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein, Switzerland or Ukraine (your first entry registration is valid until 1 September)
are either a student resident in a neighbouring country but studying in Slovakia or resident in Slovakia but studying in a neighbouring country (your first entry registration is valid for 1 month), or
are fully vaccinated, as defined by the Slovak government (your first entry registration is valid for 6 months)
The Slovak government defines a person as being fully vaccinated if:
for two-dose vaccines: 14 days have passed since receiving the second dose (but no more than one year)
for one-dose vaccines: 21 days have passed since receiving the vaccine (but no more than one year)
14 days have passed since receiving the first vaccine dose of any vaccine within 180 days of recovering from COVID-19 (but no more than one year)
you received the first dose of either a single or two-dose vaccine, regardless of the number of days since you received it (this definition of a fully vaccinated person will only be valid until 9 August)
Fully vaccinated people must be able to show a certificate proving their vaccination status in Slovak, Czech or English. They can also show the EU Digital COVID Certificate.
Demonstrating your COVID-19 vaccination status
Demonstrating your vaccination status from the UK is not formalised for entry into Slovakia, so you should follow alternative advice for entry. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
Self-isolatation requirements
Everyone entering Slovakia must self-isolate for 14 days. You can end your self-isolation early if you receive a negative PCR test result taken in Slovakia. You can take the test free-of-charge on the fifth day of self-isolation at the earliest. You need to book the test on the Slovak government website. Children under 12 who do not display any COVID-19 symptoms can end their self-isolation at the same time as everyone else in their household. Those in the same household must also self-isolate until everyone’s self-isolation period is completed.
Exemptions from the requirement to self-isolate include:
fully vaccinated people, as defined by the Slovak government
children aged 12-18 (this exemption will be valid only until 9 August)
people who work in Slovakia and are either resident in an EU country, Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein, Switzerland or Ukraine (if you reside in Ukraine within 100km of the Slovak border)
people who are a resident in Slovakia but working in either an EU country, Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein, Switzerland or Ukraine. (They must have spent the previous 14 days only in these countries. If they are older than 12 years, they must be able to show a negative PCR test no older than 7 days) (this exemption will be valid until 1 September)
students resident in neighbouring countries studying in Slovakia or residents of Slovakia who are studying in a neighbouring country. (If they are older than 12 years, they must be able to show a negative PCR or antigen test no older than 7 days)
those who are transiting Slovakia, taking someone to/from an airport in a neighbouring country, working on freight transport, funeral and/or medical personnel, military and/or diplomatic personnel, attending funerals, or caring for close relatives
For full details of the new entry requirements valid from 9 July, see the Slovak government decree (in Slovak only).
Cross border workers
The definition of a cross-border commuter from a neighbouring country includes those living within 100km of the nearest border crossing with Slovakia. Full details are on the Slovak government website.
From 9 July, new rules apply for cross-border commuters. Between 9 July and 9 August, when crossing the border they must show their pre-registration on the Slovak government’s website, a negative PCR test not older than seven days and evidence from their employer that they are cross-border commuters.
The Slovak government is yet to publish the new rules that will apply to cross-border commuters after 9 August.
Re-entering Slovakia after taking someone to an international airport in a neighbouring country
People taking others to and from international airports in the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria do not have to self-isolate on their return to Slovakia, but must register in advance on the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (in Slovak only) and show at the Slovak border confirmation of this registration and a copy of the passenger’s plane ticket. No stops are allowed, apart from those to refuel and the time the passenger needs to get in or out of the vehicle refuelling.
Transiting Slovakia
You can transit Slovakia as long as your transit journey is less than 8 hours and you do not stop other than to refuel, or if you do not leave the airport premises. From 9 July, you must use selected routes for transit as outlined on the Slovak government website (an English translation starts on page 3).
You should also check the entry requirements for the relevant neighbouring countries on your route on FCDO Travel Advice.
Transport
Slovakia’s international airports at Bratislava, Kosice and Poprad are operational with flights to certain permitted destinations.
Border crossings
Most major routes between Slovakia and Austria, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic are operational but border control checks are increasing and many smaller border crossings have closed. For a list of smaller border crossing closures, see the Slovak Spectator website
Full border checks remain in place with Ukraine. Entry to Slovakia from Ukraine limited to the Vysne Nemecke – Uzhgorod border crossing between 7 am and 7 pm. For more information on crossing the border with Ukraine, see the Slovak Foreign Ministry website (in Slovak only).
Neighbouring countries can change their entry requirements at short notice. You should check the FCDO Travel Advice for all countries on your route.
Regular entry requirements
Visas
The rules for travelling or working in European countries changed on 1 January 2021:
you can travel to countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.
if you are travelling to Slovakia and other Schengen countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90 day limit. Visits to Schengen countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.
to stay longer, to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons, you will need to meet the Slovak government’s entry requirements. Check with the Slovak Embassy what type of visa and/or work permit you may need
if you stay in Slovakia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit
Any time you spent in Slovakia or other Schengen countries before 1 January 2021 does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.
At Slovak border control, you may need to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. You may also need to:
show a return or onward ticket
show you have enough money for your stay
There are separate requirements for those who are resident in Slovakia. If you are resident in Slovakia, you should carry proof of residence as well as your valid passport when you travel. For further information on these requirements, see our Living in Slovakia guide.
Passport validity  
Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip, and renew your passport if you do not have enough time left on it.
You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).
If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.
Make sure your passport is in a presentable state before you travel. The Slovak authorities can refuse entry if your passport is worn or damaged, or looks as if it’s been tampered with.
Registering with the Slovak authorities
If you plan to stay in Slovakia for a longer period of time, you should register with the police within 3 days of arrival. You’ll need your passport, 2 photographs and proof of accommodation. You’ll have an option to apply for a Slovak ‘green card’, which can be used as proof of your ID, while your passport is kept in a safe place. Visit the website of Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic for further information.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Slovakia. They are also accepted for a return to Slovakia if you normally live there.
Travelling with pets
You cannot use the existing pet passport scheme. Instead, you’ll need an animal health certificate (AHC) for your pet. Allow at least 1 month to arrange this and relevant vaccinations.
Follow the guidance for taking your pet dog, cat or ferret abroad.
If your pet passport was issued in an EU Member State, it remains valid for travel to Slovakia.
See the Slovak Financial Administration guidance on travelling from the UK to Slovakia with pets (in Slovak only).
