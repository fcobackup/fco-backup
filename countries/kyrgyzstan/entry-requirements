The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK government’s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full ‘British Citizen’ passport.
The authorities in the country or territory you’re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If you’re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.
You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.
Restrictions in response to coronavirus
Foreign nationals are banned from entering the country, including permanent residence holders. Foreign nationals with a close family member who is a Kyrgz national (spouse, parent, child) will be allowed to enter with documentary proof of the relationship. Anyone entering Kyrgyzstan will be subject to 3 days mandatory quarantine in state facilities. If you do not show any symptoms you should then be allowed to quarantine at home for 14 days.
British Nationals who entered Kyrgyzstan after 22 March on a visa, but who were unable to register due to the closure of visa offices, will need to register within 10 days once the end of the emergency situation has been announced. As yet the end of lockdown date has not been announced.
There is no registration requirement for British nationals entering Kyrgyzstan under the visa free regime intending to stay less than 60 days. Foreign citizens can stay in Kyrgyzstan until 1 June 2020 without a visa, even if registration has expired
Visas
Due to the current outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) the Kyrgyz government has temporarily suspended the process of issuing entry visas for the Kyrgyz republic. Subordinate units of the State Registration Service are closed
The Kyrgyz government has announced that foreign citizens and stateless persons can stay in Kyrgyzstan until 1 June 2020 without a visa, even if registration has expired. If you need to extend your period of stay on the basis of obtaining a visa (work permit, family ties, or other grounds) the visa centre is willing to consider the possibility of obtaining visas without leaving the Kyrgyz republic.
You should be aware that under the current circumstances visa processing is likely to face significant delays.
If you need further information about entry requirements or visa issues, visit the MFA visa website or contact the local immigration authorities.

Regular entry requirements
Passport validity
Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Kyrgyzstan and must have at least 1 full blank page if you’re applying for a visa. This rule is not applicable when entering Kyrgyzstan under the 60 day visa-free regime.
UK Emergency Travel Documents
UK Emergency Travel Documents are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Kyrgyzstan. If using one to leave Kyrgyzstan, you must obtain an exit visa from OVIR (the Department for Visa and Registration under the Ministry of Internal Affairs). This takes at least 5 working days.
Yellow fever certificate requirements
Check whether you need a yellow fever certificate by visiting the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s TravelHealthPro website.
Registration
On 19 December 2016, the government of Kyrgyzstan approved a decree removing the requirement for British nationals staying in Kyrgyzstan for longer than 5 days to register with the local authorities. You now only need to register your stay with the State Registration Service if you’re visiting for more than 60 calendar days. If you’re staying for more than 60 calendar days you must register within 5 days of entry into Kyrgyzstan and you must register for the period of validity of your visa.
In April 2019, Kyrgyzstan simplified the process of registration for foreigners. Foreigners can now register through the electronic services portal (available in Russian and Kyrgyz only) instead of at the counter at the State Registration Service office. Under the new amendments, foreign citizens can act as a host and register visitors staying in their homes. The registration coupon with QR-code on the forms can be obtained online and printed on a regular printer. Mobile applications will be developed for reading the information.
