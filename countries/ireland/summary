The Irish authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
On 16 March the Irish Government announced that all persons, including Irish residents, entering Ireland from overseas will be asked to make significant restrictions to their movements for 14 days on arrival. This does not apply to those entering Ireland from Northern Ireland at this time.
The recommendation on restricted movement does not apply to specified categories of essential supply chain workers such as aircrew, hauliers, maritime staff, either Irish-based or foreign-based.
On 12 March the Irish Government announced the following measures to limit the spread of the virus, which will run from Friday 13 March until Sunday 29 March:
the closure of schools, colleges and childcare facilities
the instruction to cancel indoor mass gatherings of 100 people or more and outdoor mass gatherings of more than 500 people
the closure of all State-run cultural institutions will close.
The Irish Government also advise that where it is possible to work remotely people should do so and that public transport will continue and shops would remain open.
On 15 March the Irish Government advised all pubs and bars to close until at least 29 March. They also advised people to avoid gathering in any parties in private houses or other venues.
