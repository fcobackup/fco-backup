Travel to Ukraine is subject to entry restrictions
Ukraine’s border is closed to most foreign nationals seeking to enter until 28 September, including for transit. There are exemptions for some categories see Entry Requirements but the majority of British nationals will be prohibited from entering Ukraine during this period.
Foreign nationals permitted to enter Ukraine will have to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival in Ukraine if they arrive from a country in the “red zone”. Self-isolation is monitored via a government tracking app.
Mandatory self-isolation or quarantine is not necessary if a traveller undergoes a PCR test and receives a negative result no more than 48 hours in advance of his/her arrival in Ukraine, or once in Ukraine.
The UK is currently in the “Green Zone” meaning that self-isolation or quarantine upon arrival in Ukraine is not required. This is subject to change, potentially at short notice.
See Entry requirements for more information before you plan to travel.
Return travel to the UK is subject to self-isolation requirements
If you’re returning to the UK, you will need to:
provide your journey and contact details
self-isolate for 14 days
Check the guidance on entering or returning to the UK.
