All travellers
Entry to Dominica
Dominica has published travel protocols setting out its entry requirements in relation to COVID-19. Visit the Discover Dominica website for full details. You should read these before your departure and monitor the pages on a regular basis as the requirements may change at short notice. Masks should be worn at all times during your travel to Dominica and your passage through the airport. Social distancing and hygiene protocols are in place.
There is no requirement for pre-arrival testing for vaccinated travellers nor for vaccinated travellers to submit documentation prior to travel.
Unvaccinated travellers should arrive with a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival or a negative Rapid Antigen test taken no more than 48 hours before arrival.
You should not use the NHS testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test.
If you’re fully vaccinated
On arrival, once your documents have been validated, you will be considered medically cleared. No quarantine or further testing required.
Proof of vaccination status
You must present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Dominica.
Dominica will accept the UK’s proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your NHS appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.
If you’re not fully vaccinated
Unvaccinated travellers should arrive with a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival or a negative Rapid Antigen test taken no more than 48 hours before arrival.
There is no requirement for unvaccinated travellers to submit documentation prior to arrival in Dominica. On arrival, you will undergo a health assessment. If symptomatic you will be required to take a Rapid Antigen Test. If positive, you will be transported to the government isolation facility (COVID Care Complex) in Portsmouth. While you are in the government isolation facility, you will need to pay for your own meals.
