With effect from 15 March, foreign citizens who are not residents of Ukraine will not be allowed to enter the country. Those already in Ukraine will be permitted to leave.
There are currently extremely limited commercial options available to return to the UK from Ukraine. Scheduled flights, train and bus services to and from Ukraine have been suspended until 24 April.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Ukraine. The UK government is working closely with airlines and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Measures imposed by some third countries to combat coronavirus include restricting entry of foreign nationals and suspending flight operations in those countries. If you wish to leave Ukraine via a third country, check FCO Travel Advice for other all countries you will visit or transit, and check with your airline.
Future travel options
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK. For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.
Arrival in the UK
When you arrive back in the UK, follow the guidance for when you return to the UK on steps you should take to protect yourself and others.
