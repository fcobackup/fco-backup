Departure from Lebanon
Events in Lebanon are fast moving. The situation has potential to deteriorate quickly and with no warning.
Commercial routes out of Lebanon could be severely disrupted or cancelled at short notice and roads across the country could be closed. If you are currently in Lebanon, we encourage you to leave now while commercial options remain available.
Travel within or out of Lebanon is at your own risk. The FCDO cannot tell you whether it is safe to travel to any departure point within Lebanon. However, see safety and security  for information on known security risks in Lebanon and advice on how to keep yourself safe.
Make sure you have correct and up-to-date travel documents, including a passport and visa if necessary, for yourself and anyone travelling with you, even if they are not British nationals.
Check our travel advice for any neighbouring country that you are planning to travel to or through.
In the event of deterioration in the political or security situation, the British embassy may be increasingly limited in the assistance that it can provide. Do not rely on FCDO being able to evacuate you in an emergency.

If you cannot leave Lebanon
You should have a personal emergency plan that does not rely on the UK government and be prepared in case you need to leave quickly. However, if you cannot leave Lebanon, you should shelter in place if you judge it necessary and safe to do so.

Conflict affecting Lebanon
FCDO advises against all travel to Lebanon due to risks associated with the conflict between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. There are ongoing mortar and artillery exchanges and airstrikes in Lebanon, primarily on the boundary with Israel but also elsewhere in the country. Online maps may provide a useful guide to recently affected areas. Tensions are high and events could escalate with little warning, which could affect or limit exit routes out of Lebanon.
There is also a risk of civil unrest. There have been large protests outside embassies, including outside the US and French embassies on 17 October. Further protests are expected. British nationals should exercise caution and avoid areas where demonstrations may be held.
The embassy is continuing with essential work including services to British nationals.

Help and support in Lebanon
You can contact the emergency services by calling 112.
If you need urgent help (for example, you’ve been attacked, arrested or someone has died), call +961 (0)1 960 800.
If you’re in Lebanon and you need advice which is not covered by reading our travel advice, you can contact FCDO online.
While 24-hour consular assistance is available by phone or online, in-person consular support is severely limited in parts of Lebanon where we advise against all travel and limited where we advise against all but essential travel.  
If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission.
Travel insurance 
If you choose to travel, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.
