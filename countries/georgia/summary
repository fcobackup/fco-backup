The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and against all but essential travel to the rest of Georgia due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and in line with various controls and restrictions imposed by the Georgian authorities.
The British government does not recognise the unilateral declarations of independence made by the de facto authorities in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Consular support is not available in parts of Georgia where the FCO advise against all travel. See Local travel

With effect from midnight 18 March, for at least a two-week period, foreign citizens will not be allowed to enter the country. The ban will also apply to foreigners with Georgian residence permits. Those already in Georgia will be permitted to leave. British Nationals in Georgia who wish to leave should do as soon as possible. There have been a high number of cancellations or changes to scheduled flights in recent days and we expect departure options to continue to decrease. You should keep in close contact with your travel provider. Cafes and restaurants will close from 18 March.
The Georgian authorities are advising anyone who visited The Drunk Cherry pub in Gudauri ski resort after 4 March to self-isolate for 14 days from the date of their last visit.
