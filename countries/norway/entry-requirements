Entry rules in response to coronavirus
From 1 January 2021 UK nationals are no longer classified as EU/EEA nationals and will not be allowed to visit Norway unless they meet certain exceptions. You may be exempted if for example you are resident in another EEA/EU country or if you are a close family member of a Norwegian resident. Please see the UDI website for more detail on these exceptions.
In addition, to these restrictions will also not apply to UK nationals who were legally resident in Norway by 31 December 2020. Those who are legally resident in Norway will be allowed to re-enter the country when travelling but may need to show evidence of residency. This could happen at the Norwegian border or at an airport outside of Norway. The Norwegian authorities are introducing a residency card for eligible UK nationals living in Norway to help prove their status when travelling. The application process opens on 4 January 2021.
UK nationals residing in Norway and under the scope of the Separation Agreement, can use one of the following documents to prove their residence status on entry into Norway:
certificate of application under sections 19-33 to 19-35 of the Immigration Regulations
