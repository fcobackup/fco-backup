Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Benin
Travel within the country should be limited to essential travel only. Capacity on public transport is limited to 50%.
Public places and services
Gatherings of over 50 people are prohibited. Restrictions on bars, restaurants and entertainment spots have been lifted.
Visits to public institutions, including government buildings, have been limited. Additional measures include the requirement to wear face masks in public spaces and a systematic sanctioning of those people found to have breached restriction and confinement measures imposed on them.
Schools and other educational establishments have been reopened.
Healthcare in Benin
Unlike in the UK, you will need to go to a pharmacy to obtain most over-the-counter medicines. Pharmacies are widely available and are usually identified by a green cross. They will accept prescriptions from the UK although the specific prescribed brand will most probably be replaced by a generic or other brand equivalent. Benin has not yet forced a total lockdown and in the event that this occurs, pharmacies will remain open.
You should contact local authorities for information on COVID-19 testing facilities (available in French only).

COVID-19 test results are sent via an SMS text message. It can take up to 72 hours to receive the result from the day the test was taken.
Those who test positive must isolate at a government hospital if the condition is serious. Alternatively, those who test positive with mild symptoms or no symptoms are required to self-isolate at a location of their choice. Isolation is required until you receive a negative test result.
