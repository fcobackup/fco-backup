Coronavirus guidance is being updated.
Read the Prime Minister’s statement for the latest information.

There are currently no commercial options available to return to the UK from Uzbekistan. All commercial flights in and out of the country have been suspended.
We know this is concerning for British people trying to leave Uzbekistan. The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Uzbek authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
Uzbekistan Airways has announced special commercial charter flights from Tashkent, including to Istanbul and Riga. If you wish to depart on these flights (subject to seat availability), you should contact Uzbekistan Airways directly by phone +998781400200 or by visiting their Ticket office at 51 Amir Temur Avenue, Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
You need to show evidence of onward travel at Tashkent International Airport to be allowed to board the plane. On flights via Istanbul you will need to allow a minimum of 4 hours connection time for bags disinfection procedures. Check the latest FCO Travel Advice for country you are planning to transit on your way to the UK.
What to do
If you cannot leave Uzbekistan at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus;
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs;
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well

Future travel options
The UK government is working closely with airlines, the Uzbek authorities and other governments to make sure options are available for you to return to the UK as soon as possible.
You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
For more information, you should contact Corporate Travel Management (CTM). CTM are a commercial partner of the FCO and are authorised to administer such loans on behalf of the FCO.

are not allowed to leave the place you’re staying for the first 14 days you’re in the UK except in very limited situations (known as ‘self-isolating’)

The National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) also provides advice on how to stay safe as you travel by air.
