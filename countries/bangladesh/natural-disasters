Tropical cyclones
The climate in Bangladesh is sub-tropical and governed by monsoon winds. Extreme weather episodes like tropical cyclones can occur. You can find updated weather reports on the websites of the Bangladesh Meteorological Department and the World Meteorological Organisation.
See our tropical cyclones page for advice about what to do if you’re caught up in a storm.
Monsoon season
In the monsoon season from June to September there is widespread and extensive flooding. This can disrupt travel particularly in rural areas. Check that routes are passable before setting out on long journeys.
Earthquakes
Around one half of Bangladesh, including the cities of Moulvibazar and Sylhet, is located in a high-risk earthquake zone. Most of the rest, including Dhaka, is considered moderate risk. Tremors and earthquakes, usually minor ones, occur from time to time.
In the event of an earthquake you should remain vigilant, stay in a place of safety and follow any advice provided by the local authorities.
To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, see the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Tsunamis
Bangladesh can be affected by tsunamis and the government of Bangladesh can issue tsunami warnings. Monitor local news and follow any advice given by the local authorities.
