Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
Travel in Tonga
Tonga is currently subject to two States of Emergency and National COVID-19 Lockdown Restrictions.
A State of Emergency for Public Health was renewed by the government of the Kingdom of Tonga for the islands of Tongatapu, Vava’u and Ha’apai until midnight on Friday 15 July. A second State of Emergency, following the Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha’apai volcanic eruption, has also been renewed until 8am on 3 July 2022. The latter lists several Tongan islands, including locations on Tongatapu and Ha’apai, that members of the public are prohibited from entering during this period.
Under the National COVID-19 Lockdown Restrictions, Tonga operates a Traffic Light Framework which sets the baseline restrictions and timings of the overnight curfew on each island.
For more information on the States of Emergency and the National COVID-19 Lockdown Restrictions, including each island’s current Traffic Light status, you should check the latest declarations on the Government of the Kingdom of Tonga’s website.
Public places and services
The National COVID-19 Lockdown Restrictions may limit access and opening timings for public places including places of worship, restaurants, bars and nightclubs. For the latest information on each Tongan island, check the latest declarations on the Government of the Kingdom of Tonga’s website.
Healthcare in Tonga
Medical care across Tonga is not as advanced as you would find in the UK. Access to medical services and the availability of fresh foods in Tonga could be impaired during a serious or extended COVID-19 outbreak.

Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. We will update this page when the Government of Tonga announces new information on the national vaccination programme. You can sign up to get email notifications when this page is updated.
The Tongan national vaccination programme started in April 2021 and continues to operate with high rates of vaccination across Tonga using the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. British nationals resident in Tonga are eligible for vaccination. People who have not yet received a vaccine are encouraged to pre-register at the Ministry of Health’s website. You should also monitor the Tongan Ministry of Health Facebook page for more information.
