This page gives you guidance on how to stay safely in Bhutan as a visitor, if you’re unable to return to the UK.
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Bhutan to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
Moving around in Bhutan
Bhutan has put measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). For British tourists already in Bhutan, tour operators may limit travel outside of Thimphu, Paro, and Punakha.
Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans.
If you need further information about entry requirements, contact the local immigration authorities or the nearest Bhutanese Embassy. You should also check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.
You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.

Finance
There is a range of financial support from the government that you can access while you’re unable to return due to coronavirus restrictions.
If you’re in Bhutan, and have exhausted all other options to cover essential living costs while you wait to return home, you could apply for an emergency loan for your living costs from the UK government. You can only apply if you normally live in the UK and you cannot return home. This last-resort option is for those most in need, and you would need to repay the loan when you’re back in the UK. Apply for an emergency loan.

Help and support
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
