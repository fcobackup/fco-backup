You should check our social media channels (Facebook and Twitter) regularly for updates on hotels.
Visas
During the current coronavirus measures, you can extend a tourist visa for up to 120 days. This can be done online at the Dominican Directorate General for Migration website or at the airport on departure.
The British Embassy is working with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will request a waiver of the visa extension fee where possible. Contact the Embassy on UK.inDominicanRepublic@fco.gov.uk before your flights to see if this applies in your case.

Help and support
The Dominican government set up a dedicated coronavirus website and helpline (call *462) to provide more information on the Dominican Republic’s response to coronavirus. Both of these services operate in Spanish. The helpline is experiencing a high volume of calls and is likely to be under pressure.
If you need urgent consular assistance, contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate. All telephone numbers are available 24/7.
