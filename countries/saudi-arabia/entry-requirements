Warning
FCDO advises against all travel to parts of Saudi Arabia.

This advice reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK for the most common types of travel. 
The authorities in Saudi Arabia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Saudi Embassy in the UK. 
COVID-19 rules 
There are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Saudi Arabia.
Passport validity requirements 
Your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive. 
Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.  
You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen. 
Previous travel to Israel 
You may not be allowed to enter Saudi Arabia if your passport shows that you have travelled to, or were born, in Israel. 
Visa requirements 
You must get an e-visa or an electronic visa waiver (EVW) either before you travel or on arrival at any of Saudi Arabia’s international airports. The type of e-visa or EVW you choose depends on your reason for travelling and how long you want to stay.
If you overstay your visa, you could face large fines, detention and deportation. You could be banned from returning to Saudi Arabia.  
Applying for an e-visa 
You can apply for an e-visa if you are a tourist. You must get an e-visa to perform Umrah. 
E-visas are: 
valid for 365 days from the date of issue 
for visits of up to 90 days 
for multiple entries  
Apply online or on arrival at any of Saudi Arabia’s international airports.  
You will need a separate visa for Hajj. See guidance on the Umrah and Hajj application process. 
Applying for an electronic visa waiver (EVW) 
You can apply for an electronic visa waiver (EVW) if you’re travelling for: 
tourism 
business 
medical treatment 
study 
An EVW allows you to enter Saudi Arabia once and stay for up to 6 months.  
Apply online for an EVW at least 48 hours before your flights, or up to 90 days in advance. You will need to give your flight details.
Travelling overland  
Your visa may only allow you to enter Saudi Arabia by air. If you plan to travel to Saudi Arabia by the Bahrain causeway, check your visa before travelling. Ask your travel agent or the Saudi Embassy if you need help. 
Travelling through Saudi Arabia 
If you’re transferring through Saudi Arabia, you may need a transit visa if: 
you will pass through immigration control 
you will leave Saudi Arabia on a separate ticket to the one you arrive on 
the connecting time between your flights is more than 12 hours 
Check with your airline or travel agency if you require a transit visa.
Exit, re-entry and final exit permits 
If you live in Saudi Arabia, you must get an exit or re-entry permit from your sponsor to leave and re-enter the country. If you leave Saudi Arabia on a final exit permit, you must apply for a new visa to return to the country.  
Wives and children of Saudi nationals 
If you’re a woman married to a Saudi national, you must get a re-entry or final exit permit from your husband to leave Saudi Arabia. This also applies to children of Saudi nationals.
Flight restrictions around Hajj 
If you plan to travel around the time of the Hajj pilgrimage, check with your airline for any flight restrictions. 
The Saudi authorities have stopped visitors who are not performing Hajj from flying to Jeddah, Madinah and Taif. You may need a Hajj visa to board flights to these places during Hajj.  
You will still be able to enter Saudi Arabia through other airports.
