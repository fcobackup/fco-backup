See the TravelHealthPro website for further advice on travel abroad and reducing spread of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Local advice
The Irish Government is reminding people of the ongoing risk posed by COVID-19. Physical distancing should be maintained at all times. Amongst other measures, you are still advised to:
wash your hands well and often
observe good cough and sneeze etiquette
distance yourself at least 2 metres away from other people, especially those who might be unwell
limit your contact with others when out and about
keep your close contacts to a small number of people
avoid crowded areas
wear a face covering in situations where physical distancing is not possible, for example shops, busy public transport, or if you are meeting someone who is vulnerable to the virus
keep a log of all of your contacts throughout the day
The guidance for people who are over 70 or extremely medically vulnerable has been updated. The main guidance is to protect yourself by staying at home as much as you can. Should you wish to visit someone, receive visitors in your home, visit shops, travel and engage in other outdoor activities, it is recommended that you continue to follow the public health and social distancing guidance.
The Irish Government states that as risk cannot be completely eliminated, you will need to decide what is right for you and your health. See the Irish Government website for further information, which covers relevant information for a range of different scenarios.

Sporting activities may recommence, including team leagues, close contact sports, indoor gyms, sports facilities and pools.
The resumption of visiting at hospitals, nursing homes and other residential settings is continuing on a planned, phased basis. Contact the facility you are visiting ahead of your visit for details, and do not visit if you have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been a close contact of someone who is confirmed as having the virus.
A number of educational facilities are now able to open, whilst observing all of the relevant public health guidelines. See the Irish Government website for further details.

Transport
The Irish Government recommends that public transport should be used in off-peak times if at all possible. It is advised that you wear a face covering on public transport, stay at a 2 metre distance if possible during the journey and wash your hands when you return home. Social distancing means that overall capacity on public transport remains restricted.
See more detailed guidance from the Irish Government on the safe use of face coverings.
