Parts of Serbia are prone to flooding following extremely heavy rain. Details of flood warnings are available via the Serbian Hydro-Meteorological Institute website. In the event of floods affecting your area, you should follow the instructions of the Serbian authorities.
During especially hot and dry periods there is a danger of forest fires. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas. Make sure cigarette ends are properly extinguished, and donâ€™t light barbecues.
Serbia lies in a seismically active zone, and earth tremors are common. Serious earthquakes are less frequent but do occur. To learn more about what to do before, during and after an earthquake, visit the website of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.
