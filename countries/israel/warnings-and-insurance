Risks of regional escalation 
Iran has launched multiple rounds of missile and drone attacks against Israel. On 13 June a nationwide state of emergency was declared in Israel. This followed Israeli strikes against nuclear and military facilities in Iran. Israeli airspace remains closed. 
The situation could escalate quickly and could pose significant risks, including missile fire. Check Home Front Command for the latest guidance (available in Israel only) and follow instructions from the Israeli government. Restrictions may be put in place at short notice. Should you be in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and not have access to Home Front Command continue to follow local instructions including from Palestinian Civil Defence (Call 102, or see www.pcd.ps or الدفاع المدني الفلسطيني | Facebook). The interception of missiles over Israel and the OPTs may result in falling fragments or debris. If you encounter any projectile debris or fragments you should move away from them immediately and contact local authorities.
Conflict with Lebanese Hizballah 
Following the conflict between Israel and Lebanese Hizballah (LH), a ceasefire was agreed on 27 November. 
There remains a risk that hostilities could reignite, and with little warning. Check Home Front Command for the latest guidance. Restrictions may be put in place at short notice. 
Conflict with the Houthis (in Yemen) 
Following the conflict between Israel and the Houthis (in Yemen), there continues to be a risk of missile and drone attacks throughout Israel. There is a risk of shrapnel from intercepted missiles falling across Israel and the OPTs and possible disruption at Ben Gurion airport. 
Check Home Front Command for the latest guidance. Restrictions may be put in place at short notice. 
Conflict in Israel and the OPTs 
On 7 October 2023 there was a large-scale terrorist attack by Hamas in southern Israel. The frequency of attacks has significantly decreased but there is still a risk of rocket attacks throughout Israel.  
There is an increased risk of political tension which can cause demonstrations and clashes around anniversaries and significant events.
