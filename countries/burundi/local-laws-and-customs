There are severe penalties for drug offences.
Homosexual acts have been criminalised since 2009. Punishment includes a prison sentence of between three months and two years, and a fine, although there have been no prosecutions to date. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people are not accepted at all in local culture. See our information and advice page for the LGBT community before you travel.
