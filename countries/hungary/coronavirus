Travel in Hungary
Everyone should comply with the measures put in place in Hungary to limit the spread of COVID-19.
There is a nationwide curfew between midnight and 5am, except for people who can provide evidence (such as a letter from your employer) that they are working, or commuting to and/or from work, and those walking their pets within 500 metres of their residence. You should generally not be outside your place of residence during these hours. Please monitor local media for further announcements.
Shops and service providers (e.g. hairdressers) can open during the day but must close between 11:00pm to 5am to comply with curfew requirements. Stores must limit their traffic to one customer for every ten square metres.
The terraces and gardens of restaurants are open for everyone. Mask wearing for guests is not mandatory. Indoor areas of restaurants are only open to Immunity Certificate holders and their children under 18.
Only Immunity Certificate holders may visit leisure facilities (including zoos, museums, theatres, cinemas, gyms and indoor swimming pools). Immunity Certificate holders and their under 18 children can also attend sport and cultural events until 11 pm, where they are not required to wear a mask.
Individual outdoor sporting activities are allowed where the minimum 1.5m distance can be maintained.
Hotels are open to Immunity Certificate holders, their under 18 children and to business travellers. Mass gatherings are banned. Family and private gatherings are allowed up to ten people. Civil and church weddings may only take place with immediate family present and with no reception. A maximum of 50 people may attend funerals.
It is mandatory to wear a face mask in public settings, including outdoors, on public transport and taxis, in shops, health and social care institutions, and public offices (i. e. places where not only Immunity Certificate holders are allowed to be). Compliance with the rules is monitored and violators can face a fine.
Visitors to hospitals and social care facilities are banned. Some education settings including high schools are closed until 10 May, with lessons conducted online.
Street parking is free of charge nationwide, to reduce crowds on public transport.
Parking is also free of charge between 7pm and 7am in commercial parking facilities located in residential areas.

COVID-19 vaccines if you live in Hungary
Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in the country where they live. As further information is available about the national vaccination programme, this page will be updated. Sign up to get email notifications.
The Hungarian authorities have asked people to register their interest in receiving a vaccine on the vakcinainfo.gov.hu website. Once registered, the authorities will invite people for vaccination based on the order of priority determined by the national vaccination programme. You may check if your registration for the vaccine has been successful on the https://vakcinareg.neak.gov.hu/regisztracio/ website.
You will need your health insurance number (TAJ number) to register on vakcinainfo.gov.hu. If you do not have a TAJ number, please see our Living in Hungary guide for details of how to apply.
The Hungarian authorities have confirmed that all people resident in Hungary will be eligible for vaccination, even those unable to register for a TAJ number. TAJ card holders registered for vaccination will take priority on the basis of age or primary disease. The authorities have not yet issued the details of the process for registering for vaccination without a TAJ number.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about MHRA approval for these vaccines.
British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation may also be a useful source of additional information. Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines on the World Health Organisation COVID-19 vaccines page.
