Sweden has put measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).
For information on how to return to the UK from Sweden, see Return to the UK.
Entry and borders
Countries neighbouring Sweden (Denmark, Norway and Finland) have also introduced restrictions. The Danish Government has closed its borders to most foreign nationals until at least 10 May. Those normally living and working in Denmark will still be able to enter the country from Sweden.
In addition, those who need to transit through Denmark in order to return to their place of residence will be able to. However tourists and those the Danish authorities say cannot demonstrate a recognised purpose (residence, work, delivery of goods, transit) to enter Denmark will not be allowed to cross the border.
Local measures
The Swedish Public Health Agency advises people not to travel within Sweden. Upper secondary schools, colleges and universities have suspended normal teaching in favour of distance learning. Public gatherings of more than 50 people are banned, as are visits to elderly care homes. The government encourages working from home. The elderly are recommended to stay at home and relatives asked not to visit.
