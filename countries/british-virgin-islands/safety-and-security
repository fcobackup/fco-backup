Crime
Levels of crime in the British Virgin Islands are relatively low, although serious incidents do occur including armed robbery and drug-related gun crime. While most visits to the BVI are trouble-free, you should take sensible precautions to protect your personal safety and belongings - at least to the same level as you would at home, including:
be vigilant and carry a mobile phone with roaming capability;
avoid walking alone in isolated areas including beaches, particularly after dark;
don’t carry large amounts of cash or jewellery and use a hotel safe if possible;
never leave anything valuable unattended, especially when on the beach;
don’t offer resistance to an armed robber.
Take particular care of your passport, as it can’t be renewed or replaced in the BVI.
Always follow the advice of the local authorities. If you need help contact the police on 999/911 (emergencies) and 311 (non-emergencies).
Road travel
You can drive for up to 30 days on a UK licence and then must apply for a local one at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Cars are left-hand drive, and vehicles drive on the left as in the UK.
Take great care when driving, particularly on the mountain roads.
Standard taxi fares exist for most destinations, but it is sensible to clarify the fare with the driver beforehand.
Sea travel
Many visitors to the BVI take part in water sports. The rate of accidents is very low, but they do occur. Many accidents involve the consumption of alcohol. Fear and dehydration exaggerate the effects of alcohol, so take care if you have been drinking.
Virgin Islands Search and Rescue (VISAR) respond to emergencies at sea. VISAR can be contacted by sending a distress call on VHF Channel 16, or dialling 767 (SOS), +1 284 499 0911 (emergency) or +1 284 345 4357 (office).
Emergency assistance
As the BVI is a British Overseas Territory, there is no formal British diplomatic or consular representation. The local authorities deal with all requests for emergency assistance.
