There are currently no scheduled commercial options available to return to the UK from Algeria. As of 19 March, all international flights to and from Algeria were suspended, including flights to the UK. All land borders are now closed and ferry services are suspended.
The flight from Algiers to London on 26 April is now full and booking has closed. This is likely to be the last UK-bound flight from Algiers until normal commercial services resume.
What to do
If you cannot leave Algeria at this time, you should:
follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus.
find accommodation that’s suitable for your needs.
keep in regular contact with family and friends at home, so they know you are safe and well.

You will need to pay for your return travel to the UK. If departure options are available but you cannot afford the travel costs and have exhausted all other options for getting funds, you may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan from the government. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the UK.
