Airport closure to international flights
In response to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Government of Guyana, announced the cancellation of all international flights from the Cheddi Jagan International Airport at Timehri and the Eugene Correia Airport at Ogle. The closure started on 17 March 2020 and is scheduled to last for the foreseeable future. Some repatriation charter flights are being allowed to leave Guyana.
From early in the pandemic many countries in the region closed their borders. That meant that only Barbados had direct flights to the United Kingdom. The High Commission have previously managed to facilitate charter flights to connect with such flights. However these direct flights to the UK from Barbados have now stopped and it is unclear when they will restart (please consult the Barbados Travel Advice for further information). There will therefore be no further charter flights to Barbados until further notice. If you are a British National in Guyana or Suriname and wish to leave, you should contact the British High Commission by email at:returnfrom.guyana@fco.gov.uk, They will inform you as soon as departure options become available.
Borders
The Governments of Brazil and Suriname have both announced the closure of borders with neighbouring countries, including Guyana. There is no exit/entry available to Venezuela. Guidance for travellers coming to Guyana from a COVID-19 affected country is available from the Guyana Ministry of Public Health. The Guyana government hotline is +592 624 3067 and +592 227 4986 ext 215. Guyana is currently not allowing any visitors, or nationals, into the country.
Local Measures
The Chief Medical Officer from the Guyana Ministry of Public Health has urged people to exercise social distancing and carry out measures to reduce the spread of the virus.
The Government have introduced emergency COVID-19 Emergency Measures, which includes:
Curfew between 18.00hrs and 06.00hrs
Except where provided in the Emergency Measures, every person should remain in the confines of their own home.
There are restrictions on all social activities. This includes activities along the sea wall, attending bars, restaurants and gymnasiums.
No more than 10 mourners allowed to attend a funeral
