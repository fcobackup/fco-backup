Be prepared for your plans to change
No travel is risk-free during COVID-19. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to self-isolate in your accommodation for 14 days. This will be monitored by the authorities. You should expect to pay for this additional accommodation expense yourself. If you need further assistance, you should contact the authorities on 132 and request support. Young people under 18 years of age travelling alone should seek advice from the authorities if they contract the Covid-19 virus.
Plan ahead and make sure you:
can access money
understand what your insurance will cover
can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned
